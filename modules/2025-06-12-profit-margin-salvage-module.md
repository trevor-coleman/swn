# Module: Profit Margin Salvage Operation

## Overview
The disabled Aurelius corvette *Profit Margin* drifts dark in space, hiding both valuable salvage and deadly danger. Commander Zhou's "insurance policy" waits in the shadows, ready to ensure the Protocol tracking data reaches the Consortium at any cost.

## Scene 1: Approach & Assessment

### Initial Survey

**Read Aloud:**
> Dallas, as your team approaches the corvette's emergency airlock, your precognition flares—danger, but unclear. The ship appears dead, but something waits inside. Through the porthole, you see the cargo bay's Protocol detector, its lights still active despite the ship's condition.

**GM Information:**
- Ship Status: No power except emergency systems
- Hull Integrity: 85% (multiple laser scars)
- Life Signs: Inconclusive (shielded sections)
- Time Pressure: Cou patrol approaching

### Entry Options
1. **Emergency Airlock** (Standard approach)
   - Program DC 10 to override
   - Leads directly to cargo bay
   - Most obvious entry point

2. **Hull Breach** (Stealthy)
   - Located aft, requires EVA
   - Exert DC 12 to navigate debris
   - Bypasses main corridors

3. **Docking Collar** (Technical)
   - Fix DC 14 to restore power
   - Triggers ship-wide emergency lighting
   - Alerts anyone aboard

## Scene 2: The Hidden Threat

### The Specialist's Ambush

**Commander Zhou's "Insurance"** - Aurelius Specialist Harada
- **HP**: 20, **AC**: 16 (stealth suit)
- **Attack**: Laser rifle +4 (1d10+2) or Stun baton +3 (1d8+stun)
- **Skills**: Sneak+3, Shoot+2, Program+1
- **Equipment**: Thermoptic camouflage (-4 to spot), deadman switch
- **Mission**: Ensure tracker data reaches Consortium
- **Personality**: Professional, regretful but determined
- **Quote**: "Commander Zhou sends his regards. Some prizes cost more than ships—they cost souls."

**Tactical Setup:**
- Harada positioned with overlapping fields of fire
- Emergency bulkheads ready to seal escape routes
- Backup power routed to defensive systems only
- Thermoptic suit makes targeting difficult

### The Deadman Switch

**The Countdown:**
- Activates when party detected aboard
- 15 minutes until Protocol detector self-destructs
- Explosion: 3d10 damage in 20m radius
- Will destroy all salvageable data

**Disarming Options:**
- Program DC 14 to hack (DC 16 if under fire)
- Talk DC 15 to negotiate with Harada
- Fix DC 13 to physically disconnect (takes 3 rounds)
- Can be delayed but not stopped remotely

## Scene 3: Salvage Opportunities

### Cargo Bay - Protocol Tracker

**Read Aloud:**
> The cargo bay doors grind open, revealing the prize: a Protocol tracking array, its crystalline nodes pulsing with soft blue light. Adrian, your scanner shows it's still receiving data—multiple Protocol signatures across the system, including one massive reading from Cou itself.

**The Tracker:**
- Detects Protocol signatures within 1 AU
- Currently tracking 7 active sources
- Encrypted data core contains Site Theta coordinates
- Removing safely requires Fix DC 12 (1d6 damage on failure)

### Bridge - Consortium Intelligence

**Available Data:**
- Zhou's command logs (reveals Architect suspicions)
- Consortium supply depot locations and codes
- Intercepted communications about party
- Hidden partition: "Project Anchor" files

**Security Measures:**
- Biometric locks (Program DC 13 or Zhou's hand)
- Data bomb if forced entry (wipes everything)
- Backup transmitted if main core accessed

### Engineering - Salvageable Tech

**Valuable Components:**
- Military-grade spike drive components (worth 50,000 credits)
- Aurelius encryption module (Program +1 when installed)
- Emergency power cells (3 units, 5,000 credits each)
- Prototype shield harmonics (AC +1 vs energy weapons)

## Scene 4: Complications & Escalation

### If Harada Engaged

**Round 1-2:** 
- Uses thermoptic advantage for ambush
- Attempts to separate party with bulkheads
- Activates deadman switch

**Round 3-4:**
- Falls back to defensive position
- Uses ship knowledge for advantage
- Offers to negotiate if losing

**Round 5+:**
- Becomes desperate, may damage ship
- Reveals personal stakes (family held by Consortium)
- Final stand near Protocol tracker

### Environmental Hazards

**Power Failures:**
- Gravity cuts out randomly (Dex save DC 10 or float helplessly)
- Life support limited (Con save DC 8 after 20 minutes)
- Emergency lighting creates strobe effect (-2 to hit)

**Structural Damage:**
- Hull breach risk in damaged sections
- Explosive decompression if weapons miss
- Debris becomes deadly projectiles in zero-g

## Outcomes & Consequences

### If Harada Eliminated
- Gain full access to ship's resources
- Consortium doesn't learn party's exact location
- Zhou may become secret ally later
- Party marked as "extremely dangerous"

### If Harada Escapes
- Consortium mobilizes full resources
- Party becomes sector-wide priority
- But Harada owes them his life
- May provide warning later

### If Tracker Destroyed
- Lose Site Theta coordinates
- Consortium operations disrupted sector-wide
- Party gains breathing room
- Other factions fill power vacuum

### If Peaceful Resolution
- Harada provides Consortium intel
- Learns about Architect threat
- Becomes uneasy ally
- Zhou receives edited report

## Salvage Summary

### Essential Items
- **Protocol Tracker**: Key strategic asset
- **Site Theta Coordinates**: Hidden in tracker data
- **Consortium Codes**: Access to resources
- **Zhou's Warning**: "The real war hasn't started yet"

### Optional Salvage
- Military hardware (spike drive parts)
- Encryption systems
- Emergency supplies
- Consortium uniforms and IDs

### Hidden Discoveries
- Project Anchor files (Navigator program revival)
- Architect surveillance footage
- Bioweapon research data
- Location of other Consortium ships

## Connection to Larger Plot

This module reveals:
- Consortium knows more than expected about Architects
- Zhou operates his own agenda within Consortium
- Protocol tracking technology is spreading
- Multiple factions converging on same locations
- The party's actions are reshaping sector politics
