# Module: Desperate Salvation - Rescuing the Harmonic Prayer

## Overview
The party must board a spinning, dying cultist vessel to rescue survivors who carry critical intelligence about the Ur-Resonance. Time is running out as the ship's reactor approaches critical failure.

## Scene 1: Docking Approach

**Read Aloud:**
"Dallas, through the pilot's viewport, the *Harmonic Prayer* fills your vision—a 200-meter converted transport spinning like a thrown knife. Hull plates peel away with each rotation, creating a glittering spiral of metal fragments. Your proximity alarms scream as debris bounces off the shields.

Lance, your console shows the ship's power signature spiking erratically. Internal explosions flash through the viewports like lightning in a bottle. You've got maybe twenty minutes before catastrophic reactor failure."

### Piloting Challenge
**Base Difficulty**: DC 12 to match rotation
- **Rushed Approach** (under 3 minutes): DC 14  
- **Perfect Sync** (no damage): DC 16
- **Failure**: 1d6 damage to Starfall Whisper, lose 2d4 minutes

**Complications** (roll d6):
1-2: Major debris chunk (Pilot DC 10 or additional 1d6 damage)
3-4: Harmonic Prayer's thrusters misfire (reroll approach)
5: Venting plasma obscures vision (-2 to Pilot checks)
6: Another explosion shifts rotation axis entirely

## Scene 2: Breach and Board

### Airlock Alfa - Main Entry

**Read Aloud:**
"Kaedim, as the airlock cycles, your gauntlet grows cold—death resonance saturates the air. The corridor beyond strobe between red emergency lighting and absolute darkness. Bodies float past in the shifting gravity, their cult robes tangled and torn.

Adrian, your feet crunch on frozen blood crystals. The ship's spin makes the corridor ahead seem to curve impossibly upward. From somewhere deep in the ship, you hear screaming—multiple voices, in harmony."

**Environmental Hazards**:
- **Gravity Shifts**: Dex/Exert DC 10 or fall (1d6 damage)
- **Vacuum Exposure**: Some sections are breached
- **Debris**: Flying objects deal 1d4 damage on failed Dex save

### Junction Alpha - The Choice

**Read Aloud:**
"Gaius, you reach a four-way intersection where gravity seems to pull in multiple directions at once. Portable emergency lights flicker, showing three possible routes:

Left: 'MEDICAL' in multiple languages, screaming echoes from that direction
Right: 'ARCHIVES' with smoke pouring from the corridor  
Up: 'BRIDGE' with bodies floating in the vertical shaft"

**Quick Route Guide**:
- **Medical**: 5 survivors including Sister Meris (dangerous)
- **Archives**: Brother Hadrim with Ur-Resonance data (time-sensitive)
- **Bridge**: 8 survivors but heavy damage (skill challenges)

## Scene 3: The Archive Chamber

**Read Aloud:**
"Lance, the archive door spreads like a wound into a chamber of chaos. Data cores spark and melt, their information burning into the air as holographic ghosts. Brother Hadrim kneels in the center, clutching a sealed case while blood streams from his nose.

'The Interpreter saw it,' he gasps. 'Before the end. The Ur-Resonance. It's not from here. Not from anywhere humans have been.' Three cultists behind him rock in unison, their eyes reflecting the dancing data-fire."

### Brother Hadrim
**Archive Keeper**
- **HP**: 3/8, **AC**: 10, **Mental Save**: 13+
- **Skills**: Know+2, Administer+1, Talk+0
- **Condition**: Neural hemorrhaging (-2 all rolls)
- **Carries**: Sealed memory core (Ur-Resonance coordinates)
- **Personality**: Desperate to preserve knowledge
- **Quote**: "Take it! Before the harmony consumes us all!"

**Archive Hazards**:
- **Data Feedback**: Mental save DC 10 or stunned 1 round
- **Electrical Arcs**: 1d6 damage if wearing metal
- **Smoke**: -2 to all checks after 5 rounds

**Salvageable Data** (Program DC 12 each):
- Ur-Resonance coordinates (requires 3 keys)
- Cult member database  
- Interpreter's final vision recording
- Protocol site locations

## Scene 4: Medical Bay Horror

**Read Aloud:**
"Adrian, the medical bay doors part to reveal a nightmare. Sister Meris floats in the center, restraints sparking with electricity. Her eyes cycle through inhuman colors—gold, violet, impossible shades that hurt to perceive.

'The convergence comes,' she says, her voice a choir. Four survivors huddle in the corner, pressing hands to their ears. One looks up at Kaedim and screams: 'Don't let her touch your mind!'"

### Sister Meris
**Transformed Cultist**
- **HP**: 15, **AC**: 14, **Mental Attack**: DC 14
- **Abilities**: 
  - Psychic Scream (1d8 mental, 10m radius)
  - Memory Invasion (Mental save or share her visions)
  - TK Shield (+2 AC when aware)
- **Weakness**: Kaedim's gauntlet disrupts her harmony
- **Knowledge**: Full Ur-Resonance truth, Architect identities

**Meris Negotiation**:
- **Restrained**: Will share one truth for freedom
- **Freed**: 50% chance to help, 50% psychic rampage
- **Attacked**: Definitely psychic rampage

**Other Survivors**:
- Tech-Savant Willem (can stabilize ship systems)
- Initiate Vera (knows about the imposter)
- Two catatonic cultists (burden but may recover)

## Scene 5: Bridge Extraction

**Read Aloud:**
"Dallas, the bridge is a vertical climb through a shaft lined with sparking consoles. Your precognition flashes warnings—structural collapse imminent. Above, you see figures pressed against the blast doors, pounding desperately.

'Please!' a woman's voice echoes down. 'The reactor's going critical! We can't override from here!'"

**Vertical Challenges**:
- **Climb**: Exert DC 11 (DC 13 with rescued survivors)
- **Falling Debris**: Dex save DC 10 or 1d6 damage
- **Power Surge**: Equipment shorts out (items save at 10+)

**Bridge Survivors** (8 total):
- Navigator Koss (knows safe routes through system)
- Engineer Pella (can delay reactor failure by 10 minutes)
- Security Chief Dorn (suspicious, armed)
- 5 junior cultists (mix of helpful and hindrance)

## Scene 6: The Imposter

**Read Aloud:**
"Gaius, as you help survivors toward the airlock, one catches your attention—too calm, too collected. While others weep or stare in shock, this one watches the party, especially when Protocol artifacts are mentioned."

### The Hidden Agent
**"Initiate Yvel"** (Real name: Agent Cortez)
- **HP**: 8, **AC**: 11, **Skills**: Sneak+2, Talk+1, Shoot+1
- **Equipment**: Hidden recorder, poison tooth, tracker beacon
- **Mission**: Steal archive data, eliminate witnesses
- **Tell**: No cult scarification, asks technical questions
- **Discovery**: DC 14 Notice or Lance's Network Echo

**If Discovered**:
- Attempts negotiation first
- Offers Consortium rewards for data
- Will take hostage if desperate
- Activates beacon if killed (Consortium arrives in 4 hours)

## Scene 7: Catastrophic Escape

**Read Aloud:**
"Kaedim, your gauntlet screams a warning as the ship's spin suddenly accelerates. Through the viewports, you see the reactor housing glowing white-hot. Adrian, your engineering readouts show total containment failure in ninety seconds.

Lance, worse—Cou's defense grid is powering up, orange targeting lasers already sweeping toward your position."

### Escape Sequence (5 rounds)
**Round 1-2**: Get remaining survivors to airlock
**Round 3**: Seal and cycle airlock (Fix DC 10 if damaged)
**Round 4**: Emergency undocking (Pilot DC 14)
**Round 5**: Clear blast radius (Pilot DC 12)

**Per Round Complications** (roll d6):
1-2: Survivor panics, needs restraining
3-4: System failure, needs immediate fix
5: Hull breach in current section
6: Gravity generator inverts

## Rewards & Consequences

### Data Recovered
- **Ur-Resonance Location**: Requires keys from Cou, Islaanreon, Villa
- **Interpreter's Vision**: The Ur-Resonance predates humanity
- **Cult Intelligence**: Network of sector contacts
- **Warning**: "Solano was always meant to open"

### Survivors Saved
**0-3**: Minimal intel, bad reputation
**4-8**: Good intel, one becomes crew contact  
**9-15**: Excellent intel, cultists owe life debt
**16-20**: Complete data, Meris becomes guide
**21-23**: Perfect rescue, hidden cache coordinates

### Time Taken
**Under 15 minutes**: Escape clean, no pursuit
**15-20 minutes**: Close call, minor damage
**20-25 minutes**: Caught in explosion edge (2d10 damage)
**Over 25 minutes**: Direct explosion (save or die)

## Hooks Forward
- Survivors mention "the Solano countdown"
- Meris knows which information broker is the Architect
- Archive data points to three key locations
- Imposter's beacon brings Consortium attention
- Refugees need somewhere safe to go
