# Module: Dead Money - Salvaging the Profit Margin

## Overview
The disabled Aurelius Consortium corvette drifts in space, seemingly abandoned. But the valuable Protocol tracking device aboard hides a deadly secret—and a ticking clock.

## Scene 1: Approach Assessment

**Read Aloud:**
"Lance, your sensors paint a detailed picture of the *Profit Margin*. The corvette hangs motionless, her drive section dark. Scorch marks from Cou's defense grid stripe her hull like claw marks. No running lights, no energy signatures except... there. A faint power reading from the cargo section.

Dallas, something feels wrong. Your precognition gives you flashes—a figure in shadow, a countdown timer, an explosion. The danger isn't past tense."

### Initial Scans
**Sensor Sweep** (Notice/Program DC 10):
- Main power offline, emergency batteries only
- Life support functioning in three sections
- Cargo bay has independent power source
- No life signs detected (DC 15 reveals this is false)

**Visual Assessment**:
- Battle damage on starboard side
- Escape pods already launched
- Docking collar intact but unpowered
- Cargo bay doors sealed

## Scene 2: Boarding Options

### Option A: Main Airlock
**Read Aloud:**
"Adrian, the airlock cycles slowly on battery power. Beyond, emergency strips cast pools of amber light down a corridor lined with Consortium efficiency—everything labeled, everything in place. Your breath mists in the cold air. The artificial gravity is off, leaving you floating."

**Hazards**:
- No gravity (all physical actions at -2)
- Cold exposure (Con save DC 8 after 10 minutes)
- Darkness between emergency lights

### Option B: Cargo Bay Breach
**Read Aloud:**
"Kaedim, your cutting torch opens a wound in the cargo bay door. Inside, the Protocol detector sits in a reinforced cradle, its displays cycling through data streams. The device is the size of a ground car, all crystalline sensors and pretech components. Green status lights pulse steadily—fully operational despite the ship's condition."

**Immediate Discovery**:
The detector is hardwired to the ship's black box and a military-grade transmitter. Someone expected salvagers.

## Scene 3: The Hidden Guardian

### Initial Exploration

**Read Aloud:**
"Gaius, you're checking the crew quarters when you notice something odd—a coffee mug floating in the galley, still steaming. The liquid sphere wobbling in zero gravity is fresh, maybe minutes old.

Lance, your Network Echo suddenly screams a warning. Someone here has Protocol conditioning—advanced combat wetware designed to hide from sensors."

### Specialist Harada Reveals
**Triggered by**: Attempting to move detector OR 10 minutes exploration

**Read Aloud:**
"The air shimmers behind Dallas like heat distortion. A figure in a skin-tight thermoptic suit materializes, mag-boots silent on the deck. The specialist's face is hidden behind a tactical visor, but their voice is tired, almost apologetic.

'Please don't make me kill you. The detector's rigged with a deadman switch linked to my vitals. Fifteen minutes once my heart stops. Commander Zhou was very specific—this data reaches the Consortium, or everyone dies.'"

### Specialist Yuki Harada
**Aurelius Consortium Covert Ops**
- **HP**: 20, **AC**: 16 (thermoptic suit), **Saves**: 11+
- **Attacks**: 
  - Laser Rifle +5 (1d10+2, no recoil in zero-G)
  - Vibro-knife +4 (1d8+1, ignores 2 points of armor)
  - Stun grenades (DC 12 or paralyzed 3 rounds)
- **Skills**: Sneak+3, Shoot+2, Stab+2, Program+1, Exert+1
- **Special Abilities**:
  - Thermoptic Cloak (-4 to spot when still)
  - Zero-G Training (no penalties for weightlessness)
  - Combat Stims (1/scene, gain extra action)
- **Equipment**: Deadman switch, encrypted commpad, med supplies

**Personality**:
- Professional soldier, not a fanatic
- Respects worthy opponents
- Hates this assignment but follows orders
- Has family on Consortium world

**Negotiation Options**:
- **Appeal to Survival**: They die too if bomb goes off
- **Technical Solution**: Help fake their death
- **Bribery**: Offer more than Consortium pays
- **Honor**: Single combat for the device

## Scene 4: The Ticking Clock

### Deadman Switch Mechanics

**Read Aloud:**
"Adrian, the specialist shows you their wrist display—biometric monitors feeding directly to the detonator. Heart rate, blood oxygen, neural activity. If any flatline, or if the device is tampered with incorrectly, fifteen minutes until 30 kilos of military-grade explosives turn this ship into vapor."

**Disarming Options**:
1. **Program DC 14**: Hack the deadman switch (DC 16 if Harada is hostile)
2. **Fix DC 15**: Physically bypass detonator (requires 10 minutes)
3. **Medical Solution**: Keep Harada sedated but alive
4. **Desperate**: Cut device free and run (5 minutes to minimum safe distance)

**Countdown Triggers**:
- Harada dies or goes unconscious
- Detector tampered with incorrectly
- Black box transmission interrupted
- Manual activation by Harada

## Scene 5: The Black Box Problem

**Read Aloud:**
"Lance, you've found the bridge's black box—and it's been busy. The device has recorded everything: your ship's signatures, the battle, your current position. Worse, it's transmitting on a Consortium emergency frequency.

The transmission log shows: 'RECURSIVE BACKUP COMPLETE. AURELIUS COMMAND NOTIFIED. ASSET RECOVERY EN ROUTE. ETA 4 HOURS.'"

### The Real Trap
Commander Zhou's true insurance: Even if the party escapes with the detector, Consortium knows exactly who they are and where they've been.

**Black Box Options**:
- **Destroy It**: Alerts Harada immediately
- **Corrupt Data**: Program DC 13, takes 20 minutes
- **Replace Record**: Program DC 16, false trail
- **Steal It**: Another piece of leverage

## Scene 6: The Protocol Detector

**Read Aloud:**
"Kaedim, as you approach the detector, your gauntlet resonates painfully. The machine responds, its displays shifting to show a sector map marked with pulsing points of light. One pulses brighter than the others—Site Theta, with coordinates.

Adrian, you notice something else. The detector isn't just passive—it's been mapping Protocol signatures for months. Including detailed scans of three specific biosigns that match your party members."

### Detector Capabilities
- Range: 1 AU for active Protocol signatures
- Can detect dormant sites at 0.1 AU
- Stores signature history for 6 months
- Identifies individual Protocol users
- Contains Site Theta navigation data

### Hidden Function
**Discovery DC 15**: The detector can be reversed to mask Protocol signatures instead of finding them—invaluable for avoiding other detectors.

## Resolution Options

### Combat Victory
- Harada fights professionally but not suicidally
- Will negotiate if clearly outmatched
- Leaves hidden message if killed: "Zhou knows"

### Successful Negotiation
- Harada provides Consortium patrol routes
- Warns about other Protocol hunters
- Might become reluctant ally later

### Technical Solution
- Fake Harada's death, they disappear
- Detector secured without explosion
- Gain grateful professional contact

### Rushed Escape
- Grab detector and run
- Explosion damages pursuing ships
- Consortium definitely hostile now

## Rewards & Consequences

### Secured Detector
- Track Protocol sites across sector
- Mask party's signatures (if discovered)
- Site Theta coordinates
- Warning about Architect activity

### Black Box Data
- Consortium has full party identification
- 4-hour head start before pursuit
- Zhou's personal interest triggered
- Possible frame-job opportunities

### Harada's Intelligence
- Three other Protocol detectors in sector
- Consortium found something at Aurelius Belt
- High Command very interested in party
- Zhou has secret agenda

### Time Costs
**Quick & Violent** (under 20 min): Clean escape
**Careful Technical** (20-40 min): No immediate pursuit
**Full Negotiation** (40-60 min): Cou patrols arrive
**Botched** (over 60 min): Multiple complications

## Future Hooks
- Zhou becomes recurring antagonist/ally
- Harada might return (enemy or friend)
- Consortium acceleration of Protocol hunt
- Other factions want the detector
- Site Theta coordinates draw everyone
