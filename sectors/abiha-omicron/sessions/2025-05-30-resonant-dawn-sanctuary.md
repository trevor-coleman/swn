# Session: The Resonant Dawn Sanctuary
**Date**: Last Thursday in May 2025

## Summary
The party infiltrated the Resonant Dawn sanctuary on Teonxe, participated in a dangerous communion ritual, and discovered the locations of five Protocol key fragments. Kaedim's attempt to extract the Interpreter's neural key pattern triggered a catastrophic system failure, leaving Lance trapped in neural feedback.

## Key Events

### Arrival at Dul-Yaq System
- Discovered quarantined ships caught by Cou's "shackle" enforcement systems
- Gaius researched local drug trade:
  - Cult's "Dawn's Kiss" psychedelic
  - Refugee markets

### Teonxe Landing
- Resonant Dawn identified party immediately:
  - Reports from Sister Meris
  - Gauntlet's resonance signature
- Met **Sister Ardent Vel** (Third Resonator, former xenoarchaeologist)
- Taken to Sanctuary of First Echo

### The Interpreter
- Revealed as barely human entity
- Merged with pretech systems centuries ago
- Connected to sanctuary via light cables
- Crystalline eye implants
- Offered "communion" via Dawn's Kiss drug

### The Communion Ritual
- Dallas's Oracle revealed two paths: compliance or conflict
- Party chose participation
- Consumed psychedelic compound
- Shared consciousness experience:
  - Party's memories flowed to Interpreter
  - Interpreter's memories revealed Protocol history, the Scream, his transformation

### Kaedim's Power Play
- Gauntlet recognized Interpreter's subordinate status to Khyber lineage
- Kaedim embraced control: "All flows through me"
- Gained command over:
  - Sanctuary systems
  - Connected cultists
- Searched network for Protocol key fragments

### Critical Discoveries

**Located 5 Protocol fragments across sector:**
1. **Cou** - In the shackle system
2. **Islaanreon** - Unbraked AI (has 2 physical keys)
3. **Site Theta in Hrefna** - Complete nexus
4. **Villa** - In darkness
5. **The Interpreter** - Integrated into neural structure

### Failed Extraction
- Kaedim attempted to copy Interpreter's key pattern into gauntlet
- Roll failed (11 vs DC 14)
- Caused catastrophic cascade:
  - Interpreter's consciousness fragmenting
  - Sanctuary systems failing
- Lance failed disconnect save - trapped in collapsing network

### Current Crisis
- Lance seized by neural feedback, potentially transforming
- Sanctuary failing with explosions and hostile cultists
- Partial corrupted key pattern (40%) downloaded to gauntlet
- Received warning: **"The Scream was not an accident"**
- Party needs immediate escape

## Notable NPCs
- **The Interpreter**: Ancient human-pretech hybrid, cult leader
- **Sister Ardent Vel**: Third Resonator, former xenoarchaeologist
- **Sister Meris**: Previously encountered, reported party's arrival

## Outcomes
- Discovered locations of all Protocol key fragments
- Gained partial (corrupted) key pattern
- Lance in critical condition
- Sanctuary systems collapsing
- Cultists turning hostile
- Major revelation about the Scream

## Immediate Priorities
1. Escape sanctuary with Lance
2. Prevent Lance's transformation
3. Process Protocol fragment locations
4. Understand Scream revelation
