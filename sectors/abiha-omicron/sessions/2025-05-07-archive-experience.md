# Session: Archive Experience
**Date**: May 7, 2025

## Summary
The party underwent a three-basin purification ritual at the Archive that revealed their true natures and granted them access to specialized knowledge. The session culminated in a final judgment ritual to determine if Kaedim could keep his Khyber gauntlet.

## Key Events

### Ritual Purification
The party underwent a three-basin purification ritual with the following results:

- **Dallas**: Recognized as Navigator with precognitive abilities, granted special access to historical navigation knowledge
- **Kaedim**: Identified as Khyber lineage, gauntlet caused dramatic resonance requiring containment protocols
- **Adrian**: Catalogued as technical specialist, granted access to medical/biological databases
- **Lance**: Unusual reaction due to altered neurochemistry, perceived as having "unconventional pathways"

### Knowledge Acquired

1. **Navigation Fundamentals**: Dallas learned meditation techniques and historical context of precog navigators
2. **Khyber Control Methods**: Kaedim gained understanding of resonance management and gauntlet capabilities
3. **Restoration Protocols**: Lance accessed technical documentation for network reactivation procedures
4. **Medical Database**: Adrian obtained comprehensive biological data for Campera system

### Disturbing Revelations

- Historical Navigator-Khyber relationship was exploitative - navigators were conditioned for dependency
- Archive founded partly by escaped navigators who opposed Khyber control systems
- Dallas and Kaedim show compatibility patterns suggesting either natural synchronization or external manipulation
- Statistical improbability of their "chance" meeting questioned by Archive scholars

### Final Judgment

- Final judgment ritual initiated in psychedelic vapor chamber
- Kaedim's worthiness to retain gauntlet being evaluated by Archive's ancient assessment systems
- Party's true intentions being revealed through vapor-induced mental transparency
- Stakes: Pass judgment and leave with knowledge/gauntlet, or fail and have gauntlet confiscated

## Key Tensions

1. Archive's protective stance vs. party's need for the gauntlet
2. Historical exploitation concerns vs. current necessity for interstellar travel
3. Party unity potentially tested by individual assessment outcomes

## Notable NPCs
- **Isa**: Archive authority figure who commands the ritual and containment protocols

## Cliffhanger
The party awaits the Archive's judgment on whether Kaedim can keep the gauntlet, with their true intentions laid bare by the psychedelic vapors.
