# Session: Cou Approach & Consortium Battle
**Date**: June 12, 2025 (Session Part 2)

## Summary
The party approached Cou's failing shackle system and engaged Aurelius Consortium forces while rescuing Resonant Dawn refugees. They discovered the cultists carry critical intelligence about "Ur-Resonance" while the Consortium has been actively tracking Protocol signatures.

## Key Events

### Approach to Cou
- Detected failing shackle grid system in cascade pattern
- Some zones completely free, others in lockdown
- System unstable without Interpreter's maintenance

### The Pursuit
- Intercepted distress call from **Harmonic Prayer** (Resonant Dawn refugee ship)
- Ship carrying 23 survivors fleeing Teonxe
- Pursued by Aurelius Consortium forces:
  - 1 Corvette (*Profit Margin*)
  - 2 Patrol boats

### Space Combat
- Lance hacked refugee ship, plotted escape route through malfunctioning defenses
- Used failing shackle grid as weapon against pursuers
- Consortium forces took heavy damage in defenses
- **Combat Results:**
  - Both patrol boats destroyed
  - Corvette *Profit Margin* disabled

### Negotiation
- Party negotiated with **Commander Zhou** of disabled corvette
- Traded fuel transfer for crew's lives
- Zhou accepted terms, allowed crew evacuation
- Zhou's cryptic warning: "Some prizes cost more than ships"

### Critical Discoveries
- Kaedim detected **Protocol tracking device** aboard corvette
- Device is valuable Consortium salvage
- Consortium has been actively tracking Protocol signatures
- Harmonic Prayer carries **Sister Meris** (sedated/restrained?)

### Refugee Intelligence
- Sister Meris among 23 survivors
- Refugees claim knowledge of **"Ur-Resonance"** location
- Information from Interpreter's final revelation
- Brought critical cult archives from Teonxe

## Current Situation
- Party approaching damaged *Harmonic Prayer* for rescue
- Cou's defenses continuing to fail
- Disabled Consortium corvette nearby
- Protocol tracker aboard corvette

## Mysteries Introduced
1. What is "Ur-Resonance"?
2. Why were Cou's shackles really installed?
3. Connection to gas giant Solano?
4. What's at the shackle control nodes?

## Immediate Concerns
- Harmonic Prayer spinning dangerously
- Potential structural collapse
- Sister Meris's condition unknown
- Cult archives may contain hazards
- Limited time before more Consortium forces arrive

## NPCs
- **Commander Zhou**: Aurelius corvette captain, surprisingly reasonable
- **Sister Meris**: Resonant Dawn survivor, condition unknown
- **23 Refugees**: Mixed cultists with varying stability

## Next Session Setup
- Dangerous boarding operation on spinning ship
- Potential hidden threats on corvette
- Race against time before Consortium reinforcements
- Mystery of Ur-Resonance to explore
