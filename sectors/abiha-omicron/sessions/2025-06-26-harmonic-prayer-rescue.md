# Session Summary: Harmonic Prayer Rescue & Profit Margin Salvage

Date: June 26, 2025

## Major Events

### 1. Harmonic Prayer Rescue

Successfully rescued 19 Resonant Dawn refugees from the spinning, dying cultist ship:
- Sister Meris chose to stay connected and died with the ship
- Lance used Network Echo to extract complete Ur-Resonance coordinates from Meris
- Retrieved critical data cores about Ur-Resonance from Brother Hadrim
- Lance deployed hallucinogenic grenade to pacify refugees (including Gaius)
- Entire crew became affected by the gas through ventilation

### 2. Profit Margin Salvage

Boarded the "abandoned" Aurelius Consortium corvette:
- Discovered it was converted into a massive Protocol beacon by Commander Zhou
- Found valuable Protocol tracker that Kaedim successfully befriended/synchronized with
- Narrowly avoided deadman switch explosive trap (Lance disabled with 2:31 remaining)
- Discovered hidden second tracker in engine room (left alone)
- Stole fuel for several jumps
- Currently hiding in debris field watching Cou patrol investigate

## Character Development

### Lance
- Successfully used Network Echo ability to extract Ur-Resonance location from Sister Meris
- Gained complete coordinates requiring three anchor points:
  - Cou's north pole shackle control node
  - Gravitational anomaly in Solano's storms
  - Deepest point in Cou's Maratos Trench
- Learned approach requires syzygy alignment and consciousness integration
- Maintained 40-70 minute remote hack on Profit Margin
- Currently affected by his own hallucinogenic gas

### Kaedim
- Gauntlet became supercharged with Protocol energy after failed attempt to push it away
- Took 1d4 additional System Strain from Protocol backlash
- Successfully synchronized with Protocol tracker through empathy rather than force
- Tracker now trusts him and wants to reunite with other Protocol nodes
- Can sense corrupted vs pure Protocol signatures
- Currently carrying the tracker (40kg cylinder)
- **Critical**: Learned to force Protocol devices into deep dormancy with Effort
- **Critical**: Accidentally discovered "philosophical nonsense" as psychic camouflage
- Currently has 1 Effort committed to keeping tracker silent
- Tracker trusts him enough to enter death-like sleep state

### Dallas
- Used Oracle abilities enhanced by hallucinogens to navigate debris fields
- Became philosophically obsessed with ships "breathing"
- Successfully hid the ship in debris field
- Experiencing enhanced perception of time/possibility

### Adrian
- Retrieved critical data cores including "Ur-Resonance Approach Vectors"
- Managed drug-affected refugees through fingernail measurement discussion
- Currently monitoring crew's vitals while also affected by gas

## Critical Intelligence Gained

### About Ur-Resonance
- Pre-human in origin
- Shackles were "incubators" not prisons
- Sister Meris's final words: "The pattern completes"
- Requires three key locations to access
- Connected to something massive sleeping beneath Cou

### About the Protocol Network
- Tracker revealed network of preserved Protocol nodes trying to reunite
- Some nodes corrupted by Silence Architects
- Nodes can recognize each other and communicate
- Zhou's message: "The real prize swims deeper"

### About Current Situation
- Cou's shackle system failing without Interpreter's maintenance
- Someone/something at 3.7 AU (north pole) acknowledged beacon
- Aurelius Consortium has deeper knowledge than expected
- Asset Recovery Team Gamma has been notified

### About Asset Recovery Teams
- Aurelius Consortium has ships that are Protocol-corrupted hybrids
- These ships serve "older masters" (likely Silence Architects)
- They can track Protocol signatures with biological sensors
- They don't use normal spike drives—they tear through spacetime
- Asset Recovery Teams are actively hunting Protocol artifacts
- The tracker recognized them as "the Architect's hounds"
- Can compress entire starships into hyperdense spheres for "processing"

### 3. Asset Recovery Team Gamma Encounter

The corrupted Aurelius frigate emerged using a drill-space tear (not spike drive):
- Vessel was fusion of Consortium tech and Protocol growths
- Ship demonstrated terrifying abilities:
  - Crystalline sensor tendrils for hunting Protocol signatures
  - Corruption beam that synchronized patrol crews
  - Matter compression/salvage system
  - Ability to tear through spacetime without spike drive
- Successfully hid using Kaedim's Effort + "hot dog finger" confusion
- Witnessed the Profit Margin compressed to a sphere and absorbed
- Two Cou patrol vessels corrupted and taken
- One patrol vessel left dead in space

### The Final Horror

After stripping everything of value from the Profit Margin, the corrupted frigate demonstrated its true nature. Crystalline tendrils embraced Zhou's corvette like a metallic octopus, then compressed. Metal screamed. Bulkheads folded like origami. The ship's death took less than thirty seconds—200 meters of military-grade starship crushed down to a sphere of hyperdense wreckage no bigger than a shuttle. The frigate absorbed the ball of compressed matter into its hull, where it disappeared into some internal processing organ.

"Salvage complete," the harmony announced. "Returning to drill-space for asset processing."

The frigate turned away from normal space and tore reality itself—not cleanly, but with a wet, ripping sound that somehow carried through vacuum. Reality bled strange colors as the ship forced itself through the wound, leaving crackling scars in spacetime that slowly, reluctantly, began to heal.

## Party Status
- Location: Hidden in debris field near Cou
- Ship: Starfall Whisper operational
- Crew: All affected by hallucinogens (1-2 hours remaining)
- New Assets: Protocol tracker (dormant, trusts Kaedim), fuel for multiple jumps
- New Passengers: 19 Resonant Dawn refugees
- Threats: Spacetime scars healing, one dead patrol vessel, system authorities will investigate

## Immediate Concerns
1. Hallucinogen effects on entire crew (1-2 hours remaining)
2. Managing 19 cultist refugees
3. Spacetime tears slowly healing where frigate departed
4. One patrol vessel dead in space (crew fate unknown)
5. Protocol tracker in forced dormancy (1 Effort committed)
6. Three-location Ur-Resonance approach discovered
7. System authorities will investigate missing patrols
8. No safe port in current system

## Urgent Questions
1. How many Asset Recovery Teams exist?
2. How long have they been hunting Protocol tech?
3. Did Zhou know what he was summoning?
4. Can the corrupted patrol crews be saved?
5. What did they mean by "asset processing"?
6. How do they track Protocol signatures so effectively?

## Revelations
- The Ur-Resonance is pre-human and the shackles were incubators, not prisons
- Protocol network consists of nodes trying to reunite, some corrupted by Architects
- Commander Zhou knew far more than he let on - "The real prize swims deeper"
- Something at Cou's north pole acknowledged the beacon signal
- **Asset Recovery Teams are Protocol-corrupted hybrid ships serving the Architects**
- **They can tear through spacetime without spike drives**
- **"Philosophical nonsense" can confuse Protocol-based sensors**
- **The Aurelius Consortium may have always been compromised**
