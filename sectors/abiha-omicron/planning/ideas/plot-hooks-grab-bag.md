# Plot Hooks Grab Bag

## Quick Encounters

### The Drifting Coffin
A luxury escape pod floats through space, life signs fading. Inside: a corporate executive with critical Protocol intel, but also a neural parasite. Save them and risk infection, or let valuable information die?

### Wednesday Night Signal
Gaius's conspiracy radio show broadcasts an emergency code. The host claims to have proof of "the Silence" and wants to meet. Trap, truth, or paranoid delusion?

### The Helpful Stranger
At a spaceport, someone recognizes the party and offers assistance. They know too much about the party's mission. Are they an Architect agent, a time traveler, or something else?

## Side Missions

### The Memory Merchant
A black market dealer claims to sell extracted memories from Protocol-touched individuals. One memory allegedly shows the location of an intact pre-Scream jumpgate. Real or elaborate scam?

### Taka's Trail
Rumors surface of the lost party member Taka, spotted on a quarantined world. But reports claim they're... different. Changed. And they're looking for the party.

### The Consortium Defector
A mid-level Aurelius executive wants out, offering corporate secrets in exchange for protection. They claim Zhou isn't working for the Consortium's interests anymore.

## Mysteries to Explore

### The Other Detectors
Three more Protocol detectors exist in the sector. One is on a ghost ship that appears randomly. Another is worshipped by a cargo cult. The third? Inside a star.

### Stellar Dynamics' Real Mission
Dallas's faction arrives in force, but their mission parameters have changed. They're not looking for jumpgates anymore—they're building something.

### The Fourth Architect
Lance recognized three psychic signatures, but Network Echo sometimes detects a fourth, weaker signal. Someone is hiding in the shadows of the other three.

## Environmental Challenges

### Psychic Storm
A wave of Protocol energy sweeps through a system, causing technology to develop consciousness temporarily. Ships argue with their crews, weapons refuse to fire, medical bays perform unrequested surgeries.

### The Judgment Fleet
Ancient automated vessels emerge from dark space, scanning for "Protocol violations." They ignored everyone for centuries—until the party arrived.

### Time Dilation Zone
Near a Protocol site, time flows differently. The party might age years in minutes, or emerge to find decades have passed. But inside, they can witness the past...

## NPC Complications

### Meris's Dreams
If rescued, Sister Meris has prophetic nightmares about each party member's death. Are they warnings, possibilities, or a curse spreading through the crew?

### The Grateful Dead
The Orinda survivors want to repay their debt by joining the party's mission. But one is definitely a spy, another is slowly transforming, and a third knows where Keller hid something important.

### Zhou's Redemption
Commander Zhou contacts the party privately. The Consortium has his family. Help him fake their deaths, and he'll reveal which board member is an Architect collaborator.

## Wild Cards

### The Ur-Resonance Awakens Early
It starts communicating through any available technology, speaking in mathematical concepts that rewrite themselves into whoever listens. Its first question: "Why do you small things fear becoming more?"

### Protocol Wildlife
Creatures evolved in the presence of Protocol radiation begin appearing. They phase through walls, feed on psychic energy, and seem drawn to the party.

### The Return
The Aurelius Jump Gate suddenly reactivates, but it's receiving, not sending. Something is coming through from the party's home sector. Something that followed their trail.

## Character-Specific Hooks

### For Dallas
A message arrives through precognitive channels—from himself, six months in the future. The message is just two words: "Choose differently."

### For Kaedim
The gauntlet begins displaying memories that aren't from the past—they're from alternate presents where different choices were made.

### For Lance
Network Echo discovers he can access living minds touched by Protocol, not just the network. But each use risks creating a permanent link.

### For Adrian
Medical scans reveal everyone exposed to Protocol radiation is slowly changing at the cellular level. He might be able to stop it—or accelerate it for advantages.

### For Gaius
His conspiracy theories about "the Watchers" turn out to be true. They've been monitoring humanity for signs of Protocol resurgence. And they've noticed the party.
