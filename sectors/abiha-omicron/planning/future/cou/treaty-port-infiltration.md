# Module: Shackled Ground - Cou Treaty Port Infiltration
**Planning Sequence: T-1 (Next Major Location)**

## Overview
The party must navigate Cou's only legal point of entry—a paranoid, heavily monitored treaty port where offworlders are barely tolerated and the failing shackle system creates cascading chaos.

## Scene 1: Descent Through Chaos

**Read Aloud:**
"Dallas, your approach vector takes the Starfall Whisper through a gauntlet of failing orbital defenses. Half the grid fires at nothing, the other half has gone dark. Below, Cou's thick atmosphere swirls with unnatural storm patterns—the shackle system's death throes affecting even the weather.

Lance, your console floods with automated warnings in a dozen languages: 'QUARANTINE PROTOCOLS ACTIVE. SUBMIT TO INSPECTION. PREPARE FOR DECONTAMINATION.' But the voices overlap, contradict, repeat in loops. The system is insane."

### Atmospheric Entry
**Pilot Challenges**:
- **Storm Navigation**: DC 12 (thick atmosphere + failing systems)
- **Defense Grid**: DC 10 to avoid malfunctioning weapons
- **Landing Approach**: DC 11 for treaty port platform

**Environmental Effects**:
- Pressure suits required outside ship
- Visibility reduced to 100m in storms
- Electromagnetic interference (-2 to Program checks)

## Scene 2: Port Authority Breakdown

### Arrival Platform

**Read Aloud:**
"Kaedim, as the landing struts touch down, you see the treaty port through the cockpit—a brutalist concrete maze fighting a losing battle against Cou's atmosphere. Massive pressure doors cycle constantly, trying to maintain the interior environment. 

Adrian, figures in full environmental suits swarm your ship. Some wear official port authority badges, others have crude painted symbols. They're arguing, gesturing wildly. One group seems to be trying to quarantine your ship, another wants to search it immediately, a third is spray-painting 'SHACKLE-FREE' on your hull."

## Scene 3: The Treaty Port Maze

### Port Layout
**Read Aloud:**
"Gaius, the port's interior is a fever dream of failing infrastructure. Pressure doors slam randomly as the system tries to maintain quarantine protocols that no longer make sense. Holographic signs flicker between languages, some warning of deadly contamination, others advertising goods that haven't been available for decades.

Above it all, massive screens show the shackle grid status—a patchwork of green 'SECURED' zones and spreading red 'FAILED' sections. As you watch, another green zone flickers and dies."

### Navigation Challenges
**Finding Information** (Notice/Survive DC 10):
- Shackle control access in Government Quarter
- Black market in Maintenance Sector
- Resistance meeting in Abandoned Wing
- Alien researcher has Cou office here

**Environmental Hazards**:
- Pressure door malfunctions (Dex save or separated)
- Atmosphere leaks (Con save DC 10 or -2 all checks)
- Gravity fluctuations (some sections 0.5G, others 1.5G)

## Scene 4: The Information Market

### The Cloudbreak Connection

**Read Aloud:**
"Adrian, following whispered directions leads you down maintenance corridors where the walls sweat condensation. The air tastes of ozone and fear. A hologram materializes—androgynous, features constantly shifting, voice modulated through heavy encryption.

'So. The offworlders who broke our chains. Or are you here to forge new ones?' The figure gestures, and screens around you light up with your ship's image, your faces, even footage from the Consortium battle. 'Information is the only currency that matters now. What are you buying?'"

## Scene 5: Government Quarter Infiltration

**Read Aloud:**
"Dallas, the government quarter should be the port's most secure area. Instead, it's a warzone of competing authorities. Military units loyal to General Tsien hold the main building while civilian administrators barricade themselves in annexes. Between them, security robots follow decades-old patrol routes, oblivious to the chaos.

Your precognition flashes: violence coming soon. The question is from which direction."

### Key Locations

## Scene 6: The Underground

### Resistance Contact

**Read Aloud:**
"Kaedim, the abandoned wing seems dead until your gauntlet suddenly resonates. A hidden door cycles open revealing Professor Ling—elderly, wearing a modified pressure suit covered in sensor equipment.

'Ah,' she says, studying readouts from your gauntlet's emanations. 'Khyber technology. How fitting. Your ancestors helped build our cage. Have you come to finally open it? Or did you bring something worse?'"

## Scene 7: The Alien Factor

**Read Aloud:**
"Lance, Dr. Sss'theta's office occupies a pressurized dome on the port's edge. Through transparent walls, you see Cou's storms raging. The serpentine alien coils around multiple workstations, four arms dancing across keyboards while it dictates notes in sibilant tones.

'Fascinating,' it says without looking up. 'The shackle failure follows predictable cascade patterns. My models suggest complete collapse in 47.3 hours. The question becomes: what emerges when the cage opens?'"

**Dr. Sss'theta**
*Xenoanthropologist*

- **Personality**: Detached curiosity about human nature
- **Research**: How shackles shaped Cou psychology
- **Discovery**: Shackles have maintenance protocols
- **Offer**: Bypass codes for "research assistance"
- **Want**: Live subjects experiencing shackle removal

**The Assistant's Warning**
Marcus Webb pulls party aside: "Don't trust it. The doctor's been communicating with something in Solano. It knows what's down there. It's been waiting for the shackles to fail."
