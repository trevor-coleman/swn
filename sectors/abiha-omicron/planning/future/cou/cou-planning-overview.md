# Session Planning: Cou - The Shackled World

## Setup
With the Interpreter destroyed, the cult's influence over Cou's defenses has collapsed. The party can now approach the shackled world to retrieve the Protocol fragment integrated into its containment systems.

## Key Information

### Planet Cou
- **Tags**: Shackled World, Minimal Contact
- **Tech Level**: TL4
- **Atmosphere**: Thick (requires pressure mask)
- **Biosphere**: Immiscible (alien biochemistry)
- **Population**: Hundreds of millions
- **Key Restriction**: Ancient shackle system prevents certain tech development

### The Shackle System
- Previously defended by Resonant Dawn's influence
- Now vulnerable with Interpreter dead
- Contains Protocol fragment as part of its control matrix
- May be:
  - Ancient autonomous defense grid
  - Robot law enforcement
  - Alien artifact
  - Pretech quarantine system

### Locations of Interest

#### Treaty Port
- Only point of offworld contact
- Exhaustive searches for contraband
- Heavily monitored and restricted
- Possible entry point or trap

#### Tokko 8 Research Base
- **Situation**: "Perilous research underway"
- Alien researcher studying human locals
- May have knowledge about shackles
- Could be ally or threat

#### Paks 2 Orbital Ruin
- **Situation**: "A terrible secret is unearthed"
- Inhabited by heirs of original builders
- May connect to shackle origins
- Potential backdoor to system

#### Solano Gas Giant Mine
- **Situation**: "Things are emerging below"
- Miserable miners/serfs
- New threat emerging
- Could provide distraction or complication

## Adventure Hooks

### Primary Objective
Extract Protocol fragment from shackle control system

### Approach Options

1. **Direct Infiltration**
   - Land at treaty port
   - Deal with searches and restrictions
   - Find way to shackle control center
   - Risk: Authorities alerted

2. **Orbital Ruin Backdoor**
   - Investigate Paks 2 first
   - Learn secret of shackles
   - Use knowledge to bypass defenses
   - Risk: Whatever secret lurks there

3. **Research Base Alliance**
   - Contact alien researcher at Tokko 8
   - Trade information for access
   - Use their research on shackles
   - Risk: Alien agenda unknown

4. **Chaos Distraction**
   - Investigate Solano emergence
   - Use crisis to slip past security
   - Access shackles during confusion
   - Risk: Two threats instead of one

### Complications

1. **Shackle Effects on Party**
   - Kaedim's gauntlet might trigger defenses
   - Lance's Network Echo could interface dangerously
   - Dallas's precog might see shackle futures
   - Ship systems could be restricted

2. **Local Reactions**
   - Population may worship shackles as divine
   - Government profits from isolation
   - Refugees from Teonxe fleeing here
   - Cult survivors seeking revenge

3. **The Fragment Itself**
   - Integrated into planet-wide system
   - Removal might free or doom population
   - Could trigger failsafes
   - May be incomplete without other parts

### Potential Allies
- Local researcher trying to break shackles
- Trapped offworlder wanting escape
- Government dissidents
- Heirs at Paks 2 with ancient knowledge

### Potential Enemies
- Shackle control AI
- Government maintaining status quo
- Alien researcher with hidden agenda
- Emerging entities from Solano
- Resonant Dawn survivors

## Key Decisions

1. **Approach Method**: How do they get to Cou?
2. **Entry Point**: Treaty port, orbital ruin, or other?
3. **Local Interaction**: Work with or against locals?
4. **Extraction Method**: How to remove fragment safely?
5. **Consequences**: What happens to Cou after?

## Skill Challenges

### Getting Past Quarantine
- Talk/Trade for legal entry
- Sneak to avoid detection
- Program to hack systems
- Pilot for evasive approach

### Finding the Shackle Core
- Know for historical research
- Notice for security gaps
- Program for system analysis
- Lance's Network Echo for memories

### Extracting the Fragment
- Kaedim's gauntlet interface
- Fix/Program for safe removal
- Combat if defenses activate
- Escape planning essential

## Revelation Opportunities
