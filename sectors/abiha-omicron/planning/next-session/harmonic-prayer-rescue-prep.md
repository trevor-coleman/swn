# Next Session Preparation: Harmonic Prayer Rescue

## Immediate Challenges

### The Spinning Derelict
- Ship rotating on multiple axes (pitch + yaw + roll)
- **Pilot Checks**: DC 12+ to match rotation
- **Failure Consequences**: 1d6 damage to Starfall Whisper
- **Complications**:
  - Debris field from venting atmosphere
  - Intermittent power causing thruster misfires
  - Communications garbled by rotation

### Profit Margin Complications

#### The Hidden Guardian
- **Identity**: Consortium specialist in stealth suit
- **Abilities**: Psychic masking or tech cloaking
- **Mission**: Protect Protocol detector at all costs
- **Triggered**: Deadman switch on detector
- **Timer**: 15 minutes until self-destruct
- **Clues**: Slight life support discrepancies, moved objects

#### Zhou's Insurance
- Commander secretly transmitted black box data
- Contains:
  - Starfall Whisper's full identity
  - Combat footage of engagement
  - Protocol signature readings
- Consortium now has full intel on party
- Zhou's coded warning hints at tracker's true value

## Boarding the Harmonic Prayer

### Environmental Hazards
- **Rotation Effects**: Changing gravity orientation
- **Structural Damage**: Random hull breaches
- **Life Support**: Failing in sections
- **Navigation**: Corridors become vertical shafts

### The Refugees (23 total)

#### Key Figures
- **Sister Meris**: "Sedated" but possibly transformed
- **Brother Hadrim**: Archive keeper, protecting data
- **Initiate Yvel**: Young, unstable, sees visions
- **Tech-Savant Koris**: Trying to stabilize ship

#### Refugee States (Roll d6 per group)
1-2: Catatonic from neural feedback
3-4: Paranoid and aggressive
5: Desperately helpful
6: Secretly harboring Interpreter fragment

### The Archives

#### Physical Hazards
- Booby-trapped with memetic kill switches
- Corrupted data causing neural feedback
- Physical locks keyed to deceased cultists

#### Contents
- Location of "Ur-Resonance"
- Interpreter's research notes
- List of Protocol sites across sector
- Names of other Architect agents

### Hidden Threats

#### The Imposter
One refugee is actually:
- Aurelius Consortium spy
- Architect agent
- Transformed hybrid like Keller
- Lance might detect via Network Echo

#### Sister Meris's Condition
- Partially integrated with ship systems
- Carrying Interpreter consciousness fragment
- Transformed by exposure to raw Protocol
- Knows party's true importance

## Rescue Operations

### Skill Challenges

#### Docking (Pilot)
- DC 12: Basic approach
- DC 14: Quick dock under fire
- DC 16: Perfect sync, no damage

#### Navigation (Notice/Survive)
- DC 10: Find safe path through ship
- DC 12: Locate all survivors
- DC 14: Identify structural weak points

#### Data Recovery (Program)
- DC 11: Access basic archives
- DC 13: Bypass memetic traps
- DC 15: Full data recovery

#### Medical (Heal)
- DC 10: Stabilize injured
- DC 12: Identify transformed
- DC 14: Treat neural damage

### Time Pressure
- 30 minutes until Cou patrol arrives
- 15 minutes until tracker self-destructs
- 10 minutes until critical hull breach
- Refugee conditions deteriorating

## Key Decisions

### Immediate
1. Board Harmonic Prayer or corvette first?
2. Save all refugees or prioritize archives?
3. Risk Lance using Network Echo to identify threats?
4. Keep or destroy Protocol tracker?

### Consequences
- Saving wrong people brings enemy aboard
- Archives might contain Architect trap
- Tracker could lead to Site Theta
- Time spent costs lives

## Revelations Available

- Pre-human in origin
- Location requires three keys
- Interpreter discovered it recently

### About the Shackles

- Solano emergence connected
- Shackles failing by design
- Architects involved in creation

### About the Party
- Interpreter knew their true purpose
- Arrival through jump gate was predicted
- Each party member chosen for reason
- Final confrontation inevitable

## Combat Encounters

### If Boarding Goes Wrong
- **Crazed Cultists** (3-5): AC 10, HP 1, 1d4 improvised
