### Nomads

Most of the natives of this world are nomadic, usually following a traditional cycle of movement through the lands they possess. Promises of rich plunder or local environmental perils can force these groups to strike out against neighbors. Other groups are forced to move constantly due to unpredictable dangers that crop up on the planet.

**Enemies:**
- Desperate tribal leader who needs what the PCs have
- Ruthless raider chieftain
- Leader seeking to weld the nomads into an army

**Friends:**
- Free-spirited young nomad
- Dreamer imagining a stable life
- Offwolder enamoured of the life

**Complications:**
- An irresistibly lethal swarm of native life forces locals to move regularly
- Ancient defense systems destroy too-long-stationary communities
- Local chemical patches require careful balancing of exposure times to avoid side effects

**Things:**
- Cache of rare and precious resource
- Plunder seized by a tribal raid
- Tech that makes a place safe for long-term inhabitation

**Places:**
- Temporary nomad camp
- Oasis or resource reserve
- Trackless waste that kills the unprepared

### Taboo Treasure

The natives here produce something that is both fabulously valuable and strictly forbidden elsewhere in the sector. It may be a lethally addictive drug, forbidden gengineering tech, vat-grown "perfect slaves", or a useful substance that can only be made through excruciating human suffering. This treasure is freely traded on the world, but bringing it elsewhere is usually an invitation to a long prison stay or worse.

**Enemies:**
- Maker of a vile commodity
- Smuggler for a powerful offworlder
- Depraved offworlder here for "fun"
- Local warlord who controls the treasure

**Friends:**
- Reformer seeking to end its use
- Innovator trying to repurpose the treasure in innocent ways
- Wretched addict unwillingly prey to the treasure

**Complications:**
- The treasure is extremely hard to smuggle
- Its use visibly marks a user
- The natives consider it for their personal use only

**Things:**
- Load of the forbidden good
- Smuggling tech that could hide the good perfectly
- Blackmail data on offworld buyers of the good

**Places:**
- Den where the good is used
- Market selling the good to locals and a few outsiders
- Factory or processing area where the good is created
