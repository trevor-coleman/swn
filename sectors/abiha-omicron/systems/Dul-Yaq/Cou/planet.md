### Shackled World

This world is being systematically contained by an outside power. Some ancient autonomous defense grid, robot law enforcement, alien artifact, or other force is preventing the locals from developing certain technology, or using certain devices, or perhaps from developing interstellar flight. This limit may or may not apply to offworlders; in the former case, the PCs may have to figure out a way to beat the shackles simply to escape the world.

**Enemies:**
- Passionless jailer-AI
- Paranoid military grid AI
- Robot overlord
- Enigmatic alien master

**Friends:**
- Struggling local researcher
- Offworlder trapped here
- Scientist with a plan to break the chains

**Complications:**
- The shackles come off for certain brief windows of time
- The locals think the shackles are imposed by god
- An outside power greatly profits from the shackles
- The rulers are exempt from the shackles

**Things:**
- Keycode to bypass the shackle
- Tech shielded from the shackle
- Exportable version of the shackle that can affect other worlds

**Places:**
- Grim high-tech control center
- Factory full of workaround tech
- Temple to the power or entity that imposed the shackle

### Minimal Contact

The locals refuse most contact with offworlders. Only a small, quarantined treaty port is provided for offworld trade, and ships can expect an exhaustive search for contraband. Local governments may be trying to keep the very existence of interstellar trade a secret from their populations, or they may simply consider offworlders too dangerous or repugnant to be allowed among the population.

**Enemies:**
- Customs official
- Xenophobic natives
- Existing merchant who doesn't like competition

**Friends:**
- Aspiring tourist
- Anthropological researcher
- Offworld thief
- Religious missionary

**Complications:**
- The locals carry a disease harmless to them and lethal to outsiders
- The locals hide dark purposes from offworlders
- The locals have something desperately needed but won't bring it into the treaty port

**Things:**
- Contraband trade goods
- Security perimeter codes
- Black market local products

**Places:**
- Treaty port bar
- Black market zone
- Secret smuggler landing site
