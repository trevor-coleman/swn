### Refugees

The world teems with refugees, either exiles from another planet who managed to get here, or the human detritus of some local conflict that have fled to the remaining stable states. The natives usually regard the refugees with hostility, an attitude returned by many among their unwilling guests.

**Enemies:**
- Xenophobic native leader
- Refugee chief aspiring to seize the host nation
- Politician seeking to use the refugees as a weapon

**Friends:**
- Sympathetic refugee waif
- Local hard-pressed by refugee gangs
- Clergy seeking peace

**Complications:**
- The xenophobes are right that the refugees are taking over
- The refugees are right that the xenophobes want them out or dead
- Both are right
- Outside powers are using the refugees to destabilize an enemy government
- Refugee and local cultures are extremely incompatible

**Things:**
- Treasures brought out by fleeing refugees
- Citizenship papers
- Cache of vital refugee supplies
- Hidden arms for terrorists

**Places:**
- Hopeless refugee camp
- City swarming with confused strangers
- Festival full of angry locals

### Pretech Cultists

The capacities of human science before the Silence vastly outmatch the technology available since the Scream. The jump gates alone were capable of crossing hundreds of light years in a moment, and they were just one example of the results won by blending psychic artifice with pretech science. Some worlds outright worship the artifacts of their ancestors, seeing in them the work of more enlightened and perfect humanity. These cultists may or may not understand the operation or replication of these devices, but they seek and guard them jealously.

**Enemies:**
- Cult leader
- Artifact supplier
- Pretech smuggler

**Friends:**
- Offworld scientist
- Robbed collector
- Cult heretic

**Complications:**
- The cultists can actually replicate certain forms of pretech
- The cultists abhor use of the devices as "presumption on the holy"
- The cultists mistake the party's belongings for pretech

**Things:**
- Pretech artifacts both functional and broken
- Religious-jargon laced pretech replication techniques
- Waylaid payment for pretech artifacts

**Places:**
- Shrine to nonfunctional pretech
- Smuggler's den
- Public procession showing a prized artifact
