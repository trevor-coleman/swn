### Sectarians

The world is torn by violent disagreement between sectarians of a particular faith. Each views the other as a damnable heresy in need of extirpation. Local government may be able to keep open war from breaking out, but the poisonous hatred divides communities. The nature of the faith may be religious, or it may be based on some secular ideology.

**Enemies:**
- Paranoid believer
- Native convinced the party is working for the other side
- Absolutist ruler

**Friends:**
- Reformist clergy
- Local peacekeeping official
- Offworld missionary
- Exhausted ruler

**Complications:**
- The conflict has more than two sides
- The sectarians hate each other for multiple reasons
- The sectarians must cooperate or else life on this world is imperiled
- The sectarians hate outsiders more than they hate each other
- The differences in sects are incomprehensible to an outsider

**Things:**
- Ancient holy book
- Incontrovertible proof
- Offering to a local holy man

**Places:**
- Sectarian battlefield
- Crusading temple
- Philosopher's salon
- Bitterly divided village

### Maneaters

The locals are cannibals, either out of necessity or out of cultural preference. Some worlds may actually eat human flesh, while others simply require the rendering of humans into important chemicals or pharmaceutical compounds, perhaps to prolong the lives of ghoul overlords. This cannibalism plays a major role in their society.

**Enemies:**
- Ruthless ghoul leader
- Chieftain of a ravenous tribe
- Sophisticated degenerate preaching the splendid authenticity of cannibalism

**Friends:**
- Sympathetic local fleeing the fork
- Escapee from a pharmaceutical rendering plant
- Reformer seeking to break the custom or its necessity

**Complications:**
- Local food or environmental conditions make human consumption grimly necessary
- The locals farm human beings
- Outsiders are expected to join in the custom
- The custom is totally unnecessary but jealously maintained by the people

**Things:**
- Belongings of a recent meal
- An offworlder VIP due for the menu
- A toxin that makes human flesh lethal to consumers

**Places:**
- Hideous human abattoir
- Extremely civilized restaurant
- Funeral-home-cum-kitchen
