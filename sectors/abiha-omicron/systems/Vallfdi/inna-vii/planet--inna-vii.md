### Warlords

The world is plagued by warlords. Numerous powerful men and women control private armies sufficiently strong to cow whatever local government may exist. On the lands they claim, their word is law. Most spend their time oppressing their own subjects and murderously pillaging those of their neighbors. Most like to wrap themselves in the mantle of ideology, religious fervor, or an ostensibly legitimate right to rule.

**Enemies:**
- Warlord
- Avaricious lieutenant
- Expensive assassin
- Aspiring minion

**Friends:**
- Vengeful commoner
- Government military officer
- Humanitarian aid official
- Village priest

**Complications:**
- The warlords are willing to cooperate to fight mutual threats
- The warlords favor specific religions or races over others
- The warlords are using substantially more sophisticated tech than others
- Some of the warlords are better rulers than the government

**Things:**
- Weapons cache
- Buried plunder
- A warlord's personal battle harness
- Captured merchant shipping

**Places:**
- Gory battlefield
- Burnt-out village
- Barbaric warlord palace
- Squalid refugee camp

### Outpost World

The world is only a tiny outpost of human habitation planted by an offworld corporation or government. Perhaps the staff is there to serve as a refueling and repair stop for passing ships, or to oversee an automated mining and refinery complex. They might be there to study ancient ruins, or simply serve as a listening and monitoring post for traffic through the system. The outpost is likely well-equipped with defenses against casual piracy.

**Enemies:**
- Space-mad outpost staffer
- Outpost commander who wants it to stay undiscovered
- Undercover saboteur

**Friends:**
- Lonely staffer
- Fixated researcher
- Overtaxed maintenance chief

**Complications:**
- The alien ruin defense systems are waking up
- Atmospheric disturbances trap the group inside the outpost for a month
- Pirates raid the outpost
- The crew have become converts to a strange set of beliefs

**Things:**
- Alien relics
- Vital scientific data
- Secret corporate exploitation plans

**Places:**
- Grimy recreation room
- Refueling station
- The only building on the planet
- A "starport" of swept bare rock
