### Urbanized Surface

The world's land area is covered with buildings that extend downward for multiple levels. Such worlds either have a population in the trillions, extremely little land area, or are largely-abandoned due to some past catastrophe. Agriculture and resource extraction are part of the urban complex, and there may be an advanced maintenance system that may not be entirely under the control of present natives.

**Enemies:**
- Maintenance AI that hates outsiders
- Tyrant of a habitation block
- Deep-dwelling prophet who considers "the sky" a blasphemy to be quelled

**Friends:**
- Local yearning for wild spaces
- Grubby urchin of the underlevels
- Harried engineer trying to maintain ancient works
- Grizzled hab cop

**Complications:**
- The urban blocks are needed to survive the environment
- The blocks were part of an ancient device of world-spanning size
- The blocks require constant maintenance to avoid dangerous types of decay

**Things:**
- Massively efficient power source
- Map of the secret ways of a zone
- Passkey into restricted hab block areas

**Places:**
- Giant hab block now devoid of inhabitants
- Chemical-reeking underway
- Seawater mine full of salt and massive flowing channels
