## World Tags

### Battleground

The world is a battleground for two or more outside powers. They may be interstellar rivals, or groups operating out of orbitals or other system bodies. Something about the planet is valuable enough for them to fight over, but the natives are too weak to be anything but animate obstacles to the fight.

**Enemies:**
- Ruthless military commander
- Looter pack chieftain
- Traitorous collaborator

**Friends:**
- Native desperately seeking protection
- Pragmatic military officer
- Hapless war orphan

**Complications:**
- The war just ended as both sides are leaving
- The natives somehow brought this on themselves
- A small group of natives profit tremendously from the fighting

**Things:**
- A cache of the resource the invaders seek
- Abandoned prototype military gear
- Precious spy intelligence lost by someone

**Places:**
- Artillery-pocked wasteland
- Reeking refugee camp
- Burnt-out shell of a city

### Rigid Culture

The local culture is extremely rigid. Certain forms of behavior and belief are absolutely mandated, and any deviation from these principles is punished, or else society may be strongly stratified by birth with limited prospects for change. Anything which threatens the existing social order is feared and shunned.

**Enemies:**
- Rigid reactionary
- Wary ruler
- Regime ideologue
- Offended potentate

**Friends:**
- Revolutionary agitator
- Ambitious peasant
- Frustrated merchant

**Complications:**
- The cultural patterns are enforced by technological aids
- The culture is run by a secret cabal of manipulators
- The culture has explicit religious sanction
- The culture evolved due to important necessities that have since been forgotten

**Things:**
- Precious traditional regalia
- Peasant tribute
- Opulent treasures of the ruling class

**Places:**
- Time-worn palace
- Low caste slums
- Bandit den
- Reformist temple
