## World Tags

### Pilgrimage Site

The world is noted for an important spiritual or historical location, and might be the sector headquarters for a widespread religion or political movement. The site attracts wealthy pilgrims from throughout nearby space, and those with the money necessary to manage interstellar travel can be quite generous to the site and its keepers. The locals tend to be fiercely protective of the place and its reputation, and some places may forbid the entrance of those not suitably pious or devout.

**Enemies:**
- Saboteur devoted to a rival belief
- Bitter reformer who resents the current leadership
- Swindler conning the pilgrims

**Friends:**
- Protector of the holy site
- Naive offworlder pilgrim
- Outsider wanting to learn the sanctum's inner secrets

**Complications:**
- The site is actually a fake
- The site is run by corrupt and venal keepers
- A natural disaster threatens the site

**Things:**
- Ancient relic guarded at the site
- Proof of the site's inauthenticity
- Precious offerings from a pilgrim

**Places:**
- Incense-scented sanctum
- Teeming crowd of pilgrims
- Imposing holy structure

### Maneaters

The locals are cannibals, either out of necessity or out of cultural preference. Some worlds may actually eat human flesh, while others simply require the rendering of humans into important chemicals or pharmaceutical compounds, perhaps to prolong the lives of ghoul overlords. This cannibalism plays a major role in their society.

**Enemies:**
- Ruthless ghoul leader
- Chieftain of a ravenous tribe
- Sophisticated degenerate preaching the splendid authenticity of cannibalism

**Friends:**
- Sympathetic local fleeing the fork
- Escapee from a pharmaceutical rendering plant
- Reformer seeking to break the custom or its necessity

**Complications:**
- Local food or environmental conditions make human consumption grimly necessary
- The locals farm human beings
- Outsiders are expected to join in the custom
- The custom is totally unnecessary but jealously maintained by the people

**Things:**
- Belongings of a recent meal
- An offworlder VIP due for the menu
- A toxin that makes human flesh lethal to consumers

**Places:**
- Hideous human abattoir
- Extremely civilized restaurant
- Funeral-home-cum-kitchen
