## World Tags

### Freak Geology

The geology or geography of this world is simply freakish. Perhaps it's composed entirely of enormous mountain ranges, or regular bands of land and sea, or the mineral structures all fragment into perfect cubes. The locals have learned to deal with it and their culture will be shaped by its requirements.

work of aliens

### Former Warriors

The locals of this world were once famed for their martial prowess. They may have simply had a very militaristic culture, or were genetically engineered for combat, or developed high-tech weaponry, or had brilliant leadership. Those days are past, however, either due to crushing defeat, external restrictions, or a cultural turn toward peace.

**Enemies:**
- Unreformed warlord leader
- Bitter mercenary chief
- Victim of their warfare seeking revenge

**Friends:**
- Partisan of the new peaceful ways
