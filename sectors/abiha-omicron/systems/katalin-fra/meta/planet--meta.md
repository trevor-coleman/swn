### Dying Race

The inhabitants of this world are dying out, and they know it. Through environmental toxins, hostile bio-weapons, or sheer societal despair, the culture cannot replenish its numbers. Members seek meaning in their own strange goals or peculiar faiths, though a few might struggle to find some way to reverse their slow yet inevitable doom.

**Enemies:**
- Hostile outsider who wants the locals dead
- Offwolder seeking to take advantage of their weakened state
- Invaders eager to push the locals out of their former lands

**Friends:**
- One of the few youth among the population
- Determined and hopeful reformer
- Researcher seeking a new method of reproduction

**Complications:**
- The dying culture's values were monstrous
- The race's death is somehow necessary to prevent some grand catastrophe
- The race is somehow convinced they deserve this fate

**Things:**
- Extremely valuable reproductive tech
- Treasured artifacts of the former age
- Bioweapon used on the race

**Places:**
- City streets devoid of pedestrians
- Mighty edifice now crumbling with disrepair
- Small dwelling full of people in a town now otherwise empty

### Feral World

In the long, isolated night of the Silence, some worlds have experienced total moral and cultural collapse. Whatever remains has been twisted beyond recognition into assorted death cults, xenophobic fanaticism, horrific cultural practices, or other behavior unacceptable on more enlightened worlds. These worlds are almost invariably quarantined by other planets.

**Enemies:**
- Decadent noble
- Mad cultist
- Xenophobic local
- Cannibal chief
- Maltech researcher

**Friends:**

- Aspiring reformer
- Native wanting to avoid traditional flensing

- Inexplicable and repugnant social rules
- Taboo zones and people

**Things:**

- Wealth accumulated through brutal evildoing
- Valuable possession owned by luckless outworlder victim

**Places:**
