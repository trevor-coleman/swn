### Friendly Foe

Some hostile alien race or malevolent cabal has a branch or sect on this world that is actually quite friendly toward outsiders. For whatever internal reason, they are willing to negotiate and deal honestly with strangers, and appear to lack the worst impulses of their fellows.

**Enemies:**
- Driven hater of all their kind
- Internal malcontent bent on creating conflict
- Secret master who seeks to lure trust

**Friends:**
- Well-meaning bug-eyed monster
- Principled eugenics cultist
- Suspicious investigator

**Complications:**
- The group actually is a harmless and benevolent as they seem
- The group offers a vital service at the cost of moral compromise
- The group still feels bonds of affiliation with their hostile brethren

**Things:**

### Perimeter Agency

Before the Silence, the Perimeter was a Terran-sponsored organization charged with rooting out use of maltech technology banned in human space as too dangerous for use or experimentation. Unbraked AIs, gengineered slave species, nanotech replicators, weapons of planetary destruction... the Perimeter hunted down experimenters with a great indifference to planetary laws. Most Perimeter Agencies collapsed during the Silence, but a few managed to hold on to their mission, though modern Perimeter agents often find more work as conventional spies.

**Enemies:**
- Renegade agency director
- Maltech researcher
- Paranoid intelligence chief

**Friends:**
- Agent in need of help
- Support staffer
- "Unjustly" targeted researcher

**Complications:**
- The local agency has gone rogue and now uses maltech
- The Agency archives have been compromised
- The Agency has been targeted by a maltech-using organization
- The Agency's existence is unknown to the locals

**Things:**
- Agency maltech research archives
- Agency pretech spec-ops gear
- File of blackmail on local politicians
