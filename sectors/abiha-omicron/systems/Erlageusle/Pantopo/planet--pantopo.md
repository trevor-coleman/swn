### Preceptor Archive

The Preceptors of the Great Archive were a pre-Silence organization devoted to ensuring the dissemination of human culture, history, and basic technology to frontier worlds that risked losing this information during the human expansion. Most frontier planets had an Archive where natives could learn useful technical skills in addition to human history and art. Those Archives that managed to survive the Silence now strive to send their missionaries of knowledge to new worlds in need of their lore.

### Hivemind

Natives of this world exist in a kind of mental gestalt, sharing thoughts and partaking of a single identity. Powerful pretech, exotic psionics, alien influence, or some other cause has left the world sharing one identity. Individual members may have greater or lesser degrees of effective coordination with the whole.

- A hivemind that has no respect for unjoined life
- A hivemind that fears and hates unjoined life

**Complications:**

- The hivemind only happens at particular times
- The world is made of semi-sentient drones and a single AI

**Things:**
