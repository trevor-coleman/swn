### Cyclical Doom

The world regularly suffers some apocalyptic catastrophe that wipes out organized civilization on it. The local culture is aware of this cycle and has traditions to ensure a fragment of civilization survives into the next era, but these traditions don't always work properly, and sometimes dangerous fragments of the past emerge.

**Enemies:**
- Offwolder seeking to trigger the apocalypse early for profit
- Local recklessly taking advantage of preparation stores
- Demagogue claiming the cycle is merely a myth of the authorities

**Friends:**
- Harried official working to prepare
- Offworlder studying the cycles
- Local threatened by perils of the cycle's initial stages

**Complications:**
- The cycles really are a myth of the authorities
- The cycles are controlled by alien constructs
- An outside power is interfering with preparation

**Things:**
- A lost cache of ancien treasures
- Tech or archives that will pinpoint the cycle's timing
- Keycodes to bypass an ancient vault's security

**Places:**
- Lethally-defended vault of forgotten secrets
- Starport crowded with panicked refugees
- Town existing in the shadow of some monstrous monument to a former upheaval

### Friendly Foe

Some hostile alien race or malevolent cabal has a branch or sect on this world that is actually quite friendly toward outsiders. For whatever internal reason, they are willing to negotiate and deal honestly with strangers, and appear to lack the worst impulses of their fellows.

**Enemies:**
- Driven hater of all their kind
- Internal malcontent bent on creating conflict
- Secret master who seeks to lure trust

**Friends:**
- Well-meaning bug-eyed monster
- Principled eugenics cultist
- Suspicious investigator

**Complications:**
- The group actually is a harmless and benevolent as they seem
- The group offers a vital service at the cost of moral compromise
- The group still feels bonds of affiliation with their hostile brethren

**Things:**
- Forbidden xenotech
- Eugenic biotech template
- Evidence to convince others of their kind they are right

**Places:**
- Repurposed maltech laboratory
- Alien conclave building
- Widely-feared starship interior
