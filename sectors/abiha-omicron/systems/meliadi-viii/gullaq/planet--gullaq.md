### Pilgrimage Site

The world is noted for an important spiritual or historical location, and might be the sector headquarters for a widespread religion or political movement. The site attracts wealthy pilgrims from throughout nearby space, and those with the money necessary to manage interstellar travel can be quite generous to the site and its keepers. The locals tend to be fiercely protective of the place and its reputation, and some places may forbid the entrance of those not suitably pious or devout.

**Enemies:**
- Saboteur devoted to a rival belief
- Bitter reformer who resents the current leadership
- Swindler conning the pilgrims

**Friends:**
- Protector of the holy site
- Naive offworlder pilgrim
- Outsider wanting to learn the sanctum's inner secrets

**Complications:**
- The site is actually a fake
- The site is run by corrupt and venal keepers
- A natural disaster threatens the site

**Things:**
- Ancient relic guarded at the site
- Proof of the site's inauthenticity
- Precious offerings from a pilgrim

**Places:**
- Incense-scented sanctum
- Teeming crowd of pilgrims

### Doomed World

The world is doomed, and the locals may or may not know it. Some cosmic catastrophe looms before them, and the locals have no realistic way to get everyone to safety. To the extent that the public is aware, society is disintegrating into a combination of religious fervor, abject hedonism, and savage violence.

**Enemies:**
- Crazed prophet of false salvation
- Ruthless leader seeking to flee with their treasures
- Cynical ship captain selling a one-way trip into hard vacuum as escape to another world

**Friends:**
- Appealing waif or family head seeking escape
- Offworld relief coordinator
- Harried law officer

**Complications:**
- The doom is false or won't actually kill everyone
- The doom was intentionally triggered by someone
- Mass escape is possible if warring groups can somehow be brought to cooperate

**Things:**
- Clearance for a ship to leave the planet
- A cache of priceless cultural artifacts
- The life savings of someone trying to buy passage out
- Data that would prove to the public the end is nigh

**Places:**
- Open square beneath a sky angry with a foretaste of the impending doom
- Orgiastic celebration involving sex and murder in equal parts
- Holy site full of desperate petitioners to the divine
