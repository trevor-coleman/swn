### Secret Masters

The world is actually run by a hidden cabal, acting through their catspaws in the visible government. For one reason or another, this group finds it imperative that they not be identified by outsiders, and in some cases even the planet's own government may not realize that they're actually being manipulated by hidden masters.

**Enemies:**
- An agent of the cabal
- Government official who wants no questions asked
- Willfully blinded local

**Friends:**
- Paranoid conspiracy theorist
- Machiavellian gamesman within the cabal
- Interstellar investigator

**Complications:**
- The secret masters have a benign reason for wanting secrecy
- The cabal fights openly amongst itself
- The cabal is recruiting new members

**Things:**
- A dossier of secrets on a government official
- A briefcase of unmarked credit notes
- The identity of a cabal member

**Places:**
- Smoke-filled room
- Shadowy alleyway
- Secret underground bunker

### Zombies

This menace may not take the form of shambling corpses, but some disease, alien artifact, or crazed local practice produces men and women with habits similar to those of murderous cannibal undead. These outbreaks may be regular elements in local society, either provoked by some malevolent creators or the consequence of some local condition.

**Enemies:**
- Soulless maltech biotechnology cult
- Sinister governmental agent
- Crazed zombie cultist

**Friends:**
- Survivor of an outbreak
- Doctor searching for a cure
- Rebel against the secret malefactors

**Complications:**
- The zombies retain human intelligence
- The zombies can be cured
- The process is voluntary among devotees
- The condition is infectious

**Things:**
- Cure for the condition
- Alien artifact that causes it
- Details of the cult's conversion process

**Places:**
- House with boarded-up windows
- Dead city
- Fortified bunker that was overrun from within
