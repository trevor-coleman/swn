### Minimal Contact

The locals refuse most contact with offworlders. Only a small, quarantined treaty port is provided for offworld trade, and ships can expect an exhaustive search for contraband. Local governments may be trying to keep the very existence of interstellar trade a secret from their populations, or they may simply consider offworlders too dangerous or repugnant to be allowed among the population.

**Enemies:**
- Customs official
- Xenophobic natives
- Existing merchant who doesn't like competition

**Friends:**
- Aspiring tourist
- Anthropological researcher
- Offworld thief
- Religious missionary

**Complications:**
- The locals carry a disease harmless to them and lethal to outsiders
- The locals hide dark purposes from offworlders
- The locals have something desperately needed but won't bring it into the treaty port

**Things:**
- Contraband trade goods
- Security perimeter codes
- Black market local products

**Places:**
- Treaty port bar
- Black market zone
- Secret smuggler landing site

### Pretech Cultists

The capacities of human science before the Silence vastly outmatch the technology available since the Scream. The jump gates alone were capable of crossing hundreds of light years in a moment, and they were just one example of the results won by blending psychic artifice with pretech science. Some worlds outright worship the artifacts of their ancestors, seeing in them the work of more enlightened and perfect humanity. These cultists may or may not understand the operation or replication of these devices, but they seek and guard them jealously.

**Enemies:**
- Cult leader
- Artifact supplier
- Pretech smuggler

**Friends:**
- Offworld scientist
- Robbed collector
- Cult heretic

**Complications:**
- The cultists can actually replicate certain forms of pretech
- The cultists abhor use of the devices as "presumption on the holy"
- The cultists mistake the party's belongings for pretech

**Things:**
- Pretech artifacts both functional and broken
- Religious-jargon laced pretech replication techniques
- Waylaid payment for pretech artifacts

**Places:**
- Shrine to nonfunctional pretech
- Smuggler's den
- Public procession showing a prized artifact
