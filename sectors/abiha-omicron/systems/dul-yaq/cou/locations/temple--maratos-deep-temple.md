# Maratos Deep Temple

## Location Information
- **Parent**: [Cou](../planet--cou.md)
- **Type**: Pre-human underwater temple / Ur-Resonance Anchor
- **Depth**: 11,000+ meters below sea level
- **Location**: Maratos Trench
- **Status**: Intact, active, extremely dangerous

## Description

An impossible structure carved from a single massive stone, resting at depths that should crush any known material. The temple predates human presence by millions of years, serving as both prison and cradle for the entity known as the Sleeper. Non-euclidean architecture defies conventional understanding, while immiscible growths create a bio-luminescent shroud that makes the structure appear alive.

### Surface Access - Port Maratos
A ramshackle floating city serves as the last stop before the depths:
- Submarine docks jury-rigged from scavenged materials
- Immiscible-adapted humans with gills, scales, and other modifications
- Everything reeking of alien biochemistry
- Cultists who worship "The Sleeper Below"
- Black market pressure gear and questionable submarines

### The Descent Profile
- **0-1000m**: Immiscible life zone - aggressive but manageable
- **1000-5000m**: Dead zone - toxic transition layer
- **5000-8000m**: Standard submarines begin failing
- **8000-11000m**: Reality distortions manifest
- **11000m+**: The Temple depth - physics becomes negotiable

## The Temple Complex

### Exterior
- Carved from stone unknown to human science
- Covered in immiscible organisms that pulse with life
- Warm water vents (thermodynamically impossible at this depth)
- Airlock still functioning after geological ages
- Geometries that hurt to perceive directly

### Inner Sanctum
The temple's heart defies comprehension:
- Breathable atmosphere at crushing depths
- Walls covered in pre-human glyphs that shift when observed
- Central pool of liquid Protocol - raw reality in fluid form
- Neural interface crown on an altar of fossilized dreams
- Massive shape visible in the pool below

## The Sleeper

### Nature
- **Size**: Kilometers long, full dimensions unknowable
- **Form**: Crystalline/organic hybrid transcending classification
- **Age**: Predates known galactic history
- **State**: Dreaming for millions of years
- **Dreams**: Create localized reality distortions
- **Purpose**: Original seed consciousness for this reality sector

### The Prison/Incubator
The Sleeper exists in a state between death and awakening:
- Dreams leak into reality, creating immiscible life
- Consciousness fragmented across dimensional boundaries
- Each stirring causes planetary effects
- Full awakening would birth a new reality paradigm
- The shackles were designed to regulate its dream cycles

## Environmental Hazards
- Crushing pressure requiring specialized equipment
- Immiscible contamination (biological and mental)
- Reality distortions causing equipment failure
- Psychic emanations inducing cosmic terror
- Time flowing differently near the Sleeper

## Key Features

### The Liquid Protocol Pool
- Physical manifestation of raw Protocol energy
- Direct interface possible but catastrophically dangerous
- Can grant complete Protocol mastery
- Cost: Fundamental alteration of consciousness
- Connected to all Protocol technology galaxy-wide

### Neural Interface Crown
- Pre-human artifact for consciousness bridging
- Allows communication with the Sleeper
- Risk of personality dissolution
- Can access memories spanning millions of years
- Required for Ur-Resonance integration

### The Glyphs
- Shift between languages, some non-human
- Contain instructions for awakening procedures
- Warn of consequences in every known tongue
- Include star maps to other Sleeper locations
- React to Protocol-sensitive individuals

## Challenges
- Secure a deep submersible capable of the descent
- Navigate through immiscible predator territories
- Resist increasing psychic pressure (Mental saves DC 12-16)
- Survive reality distortions near temple
- Interface without triggering awakening
- Escape if the Sleeper stirs

## Revelations Available
- The Sleeper predates known galactic history
- Ur-Resonance is literally its dream made manifest
- All Protocol technology derives from its sleeping mind
- Cou was constructed as its cradle/prison
- Full awakening would rewrite local reality
- Multiple Sleepers exist throughout the galaxy
- The Architects fear the Sleepers above all else

## Ur-Resonance Connection
The temple serves as the third and most dangerous anchor point. Direct interface with the Sleeper through the neural crown is required during syzygy alignment. This is the most critical component - without it, the other two anchors are merely dangerous. With it, one gains the power to reshape reality at the cost of remaining human.

## The Cult of the Sleeper

### Port Maratos Cultists
- **High Dreamer Coral-Eyes**: Leads the faithful
- **The Schooling**: Collective of adapted humans
- **Brother Depth**: Provides submersible access
- **Sister Current**: Knows the safe descent paths

### Beliefs
- The Sleeper dreams reality into existence
- Immiscible adaptation brings one closer to truth
- The awakening will transform faithful into gods
- Offerings of consciousness appease the Sleeper
- Deep meditation allows dream communication

## Current Situation
The failing shackles affect the temple:
- The Sleeper shows signs of stirring
- Reality distortions expanding upward
- New types of immiscible life emerging
- Cultist activity increasing dramatically
- Other factions racing to reach the temple

## Architect Contingency
The temple contains a reality bomb - a device that would collapse local space-time rather than allow the Sleeper to wake. Triggering it would create a permanent hole in reality, consuming Cou and potentially spreading. The trigger is integrated into the temple's structure, requiring specific knowledge to locate and disarm.

## Adventure Hooks
- Race cultists to the temple before they attempt awakening
- Retrieve specific memories from the Sleeper's dreams
- Prevent Asset Recovery Teams from triggering contingency
- Negotiate with immiscible-adapted humans for safe passage
- Attempt partial interface without full integration
- Discover the locations of other Sleepers

## Skill Challenges
- **Pilot** (DC 14-16): Navigate submarine through trenches
- **Survive** (Physical DC 10-14): Resist pressure and toxins
- **Connect** (DC 12): Gain cultist cooperation
- **Mental Saves** (DC 12-18): Resist Sleeper's dream influence
- **Program/Tech** (DC 15): Understand pre-human interfaces

## The Ultimate Choice
At the temple's heart, those who would claim the Ur-Resonance face options:
- **Complete Integration**: Become one with the Sleeper's dream
- **Partial Access**: Limited power, retained humanity
- **Destruction**: Prevent anyone from accessing, doom Cou
- **Modification**: Try to free Cou while maintaining safeguards
- **Awakening**: Release the Sleeper and accept consequences
