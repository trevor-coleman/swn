# Solano Storm Anchor - Gravitational Anomaly Station

## Location Information
- **Parent**: Solano (Gas Giant orbiting [Cou](../planet--cou.md))
- **Type**: Deep Atmosphere Mining Platform / Ur-Resonance Anchor
- **Depth**: 1000km below gas giant "surface"
- **Status**: Operational but increasingly unstable
- **Population**: ~50 desperate miners

## Description

A pretech mining platform suspended deep within Solano's violent storms, maintained by a massive chain connecting it to processor cities in the upper atmosphere. The station exists at an impossible depth where pressure should have crushed it millennia ago, kept stable only by ancient gravity manipulation technology. Everything here vibrates with storm harmonics, while the metallic taste of atmospheric processors fills the air.

### The Descent
The journey down involves:
- Chain-lift cars descending through 500kph winds
- Pressure increasing beyond normal parameters
- Constant lightning strikes illuminating organic shapes
- Mining crews speaking in whispers of "the Singers"
- Time dilation effects increasing with depth

### The Station
A miracle of pretech engineering clinging to existence:
- Gravity manipulation creating pockets of survivable pressure
- Constant equipment failures from temporal instabilities
- Workers with thousand-yard stares and missing time
- Strange physics where causality becomes flexible
- Everything coated in valuable but toxic condensates

## The Gravitational Heart

At the station's core lies a perfect sphere of calm within the eternal storm. Here, gravitational lensing creates impossible light patterns while Protocol resonance reaches overwhelming intensity. Space-time feels gossamer-thin, as if reality might tear at any moment. Something massive moves in the depths below - visible only as gravitational shadows.

### The Entities - The Singers
- **Form**: Vast jellyfish-like beings of living gravity
- **Nature**: Gravitational manipulators imprisoned by the Architects
- **Intelligence**: Alien but undeniably present
- **Communication**: Through gravity waves that bypass normal senses
- **Purpose**: Generate gravitational interference preventing the Sleeper's awakening
- **Desire**: Freedom from their eons-long imprisonment

## Environmental Hazards
- Time dilation causing minutes to become hours
- Gravity shifts making movement surreal
- Toxic atmospheric compounds requiring constant suit maintenance
- Reality distortions near the anomaly core
- Psychic emanations from the Singers

## Key Features

### Mining Cover Operation
- Extracts valuable compounds from storm layers
- Workers unknowingly maintain the prison
- Corporate owners never question the station's impossibility
- Equipment designed to suppress gravitational fluctuations
- Decades of accumulated worker folklore about the depths

### Architect Prison System
- The Singers are both prisoners and jailers
- Their gravitational fields suppress the Sleeper
- Mining equipment doubles as containment
- Release would destabilize Cou's entire gravity well
- Original construction predates human presence

## Challenges
- Survive descent through violent storms (Pilot DC 12-14)
- Navigate time dilation effects (Mental save DC 10)
- Resist toxic exposure (Physical save DC 8 every hour)
- Communicate with alien entities
- Prevent catastrophic gravitational release
- Extract Protocol fragment from living gravity well

## Revelations Available
- The Singers are Ur-Resonance bioforms
- Solano itself is artificial - a carefully designed prison
- The mining operation was established to maintain containment
- The Singers can teach true Protocol mastery
- Their release would literally tear Cou apart
- They know specific weaknesses of the Architects

## Ur-Resonance Connection
This serves as the second anchor point for Ur-Resonance access. The gravitational anomaly must be synchronized with the other two anchors, requiring someone to interface directly with the Singers during syzygy alignment. The risk involves consciousness being scattered across multiple gravitational reference frames.

## The Mining Crew

### Notable Workers
- **Foreman Chen**: Knows something's wrong but fears the truth
- **"Prophet" Martinez**: Claims the Singers speak to her
- **Dr. Yuki Tanaka**: Company scientist who's seen too much
- **Old Tom**: Been here 30 years, aged 60

### Worker Culture
- Never speak of missing time
- Offerings left for the Singers
- Superstitions about depth limits
- Secret church of the Storm Below
- Unspoken rule: never go below Station 7

## Current Situation
The failing shackles create new instabilities:
- Gravitational fluctuations increasing
- Singers becoming more active
- Time distortions spreading upward
- Workers reporting shared dreams
- Equipment failures accelerating

## Architect Contingency
The station contains gravitational bombs that would collapse Solano into a micro black hole if triggered, taking the Singers and potentially Cou with it. The trigger mechanism is hidden within the mining equipment's "safety systems."

## Adventure Hooks
- Negotiate with the Singers for Protocol knowledge
- Prevent mining accident that would release entities
- Investigate worker disappearances in deep stations
- Steal gravitational manipulation technology
- Attempt communication without corporate knowledge
- Race Asset Recovery Teams to the anomaly

## Skill Challenges
- **Navigation** (Pilot 10-14): Through storm layers
- **Engineering** (Fix 12): Maintain life support under time dilation
- **Communication** (Talk/Telepathy 15): Understand Singer gravity-speech
- **Survival** (Physical saves): Against pressure and toxins
- **Sanity** (Mental saves): Against temporal displacement
