### Unbraked AI

Artificial intelligences are costly and difficult to create, requiring a careful sequence of “growth stages” in order to bring them to sentience before artificial limits on cognition speed and learning development are installed. These “brakes” prevent runaway cognition metastasis. This world has an “unbraked AI” on it, probably with a witting or unwitting corps of servants. Unbraked AIs are quite insane, but they learn and reason with a speed impossible for humans, and can demonstrate a truly distressing subtlety.

**Enemies:**
- AI cultist
- Maltech researcher
- Government official dependent on the AI

**Friends:**
- Perimeter agent
- AI researcher
- Braked AI

**Complications:**
- The AI's presence is unknown to the locals
- The locals depend on the AI for some vital service
- The AI appears to be harmless
- The AI has fixated on the group's ship's computer
- The AI wants transport offworld

**Things:**
- The room-sized AI core itself
- Maltech research files
- Perfectly tabulated blackmail on government officials
- Pretech computer circuitry

**Places:**
- Municipal computing banks
- Cult compound
- Repair center
- Ancient hardcopy library

### Battleground

The world is a battleground for two or more outside powers. They may be interstellar rivals, or groups operating out of orbitals or other system bodies. Something about the planet is valuable enough for them to fight over, but the natives are too weak to be anything but animate obstacles to the fight.

**Enemies:**
- Ruthless military commander
- Looter pack chieftain
- Traitorous collaborator

**Friends:**
- Native desperately seeking protection
- Pragmatic military officer
- Hapless war orphan

**Complications:**
- The war just ended as both sides are leaving
- The natives somehow brought this on themselves
- A small group of natives profit tremendously from the fighting

**Things:**
- A cache of the resource the invaders seek
- Abandoned prototype military gear
- Precious spy intelligence lost by someone

**Places:**
- Artillery-pocked wasteland
- Reeking refugee camp
- Burnt-out shell of a city
