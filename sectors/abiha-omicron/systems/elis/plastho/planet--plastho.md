## World Tags

### Flying Cities

Perhaps the world is a gas giant, or plagued with unendurable storms at lower levels of the atmosphere. For whatever reason, the cities of this world fly above the surface of the planet. Perhaps they remain stationary, or perhaps they move from point to point in search of resources.

**Enemies:**
- Rival city pilot
- Tech thief attempting to steal outworld gear
- Saboteur or scavenger plundering the city's tech

**Friends:**
- Maintenance tech in need of help
- City defence force pilot
- Meteorological researcher

**Complications:**
- Sudden storms
- Drastic altitude loss
- Rival city attacks
- Vital machinery breaks down

**Things:**
- Precious refined atmospheric gases
- Pretech grav engine plans
- Meteorological codex predicting future storms

**Places:**
- Underside of the city
- The one calm place on the planet's surface
- Catwalks stretching over unimaginable gulfs below

### Holy War

A savage holy war is raging on this world, either between factions of locals or as a united effort against the pagans of some neighboring world. This war might involve a conventional religion, or it might be the result of a branding campaign, political ideology, artistic movement, or any other cause that people use as a substitute for traditional religion.

**Enemies:**
- Blood-mad pontiff
- Coldly cynical secular leader
- Totalitarian political demagogue

**Friends:**
- Desperate peacemaker
- Hard-pressed refugee of the fighting
- Peaceful religious leader who lost the internal debate

**Complications:**
- The targets of the war really are doing something diabolically horrible
- The holy war is just a mask for a very traditional casus belli
- The leaders don't want the war won but only prolonged
- Both this world and the target of the war are religious-obsessed

**Things:**
- Sacred relic of the faith
- A captured blasphemer under a death sentence
- Plunder seized in battle

**Places:**
- Massive holy structure
- Razed community of infidels
- Vast shrine to the martyrs dead in war
