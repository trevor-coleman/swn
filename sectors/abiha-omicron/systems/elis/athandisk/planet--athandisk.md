## World Tags

### Battleground

The world is a battleground for two or more outside powers. They may be interstellar rivals, or groups operating out of orbitals or other system bodies. Something about the planet is valuable enough for them to fight over, but the natives are too weak to be anything but animate obstacles to the fight.

**Enemies:**
- Ruthless military commander
- Looter pack chieftain
- Traitorous collaborator

**Friends:**
- Native desperately seeking protection
- Pragmatic military officer
- Hapless war orphan

**Complications:**
- The war just ended as both sides are leaving
- The natives somehow brought this on themselves
- A small group of natives profit tremendously from the fighting

**Things:**
- A cache of the resource the invaders seek
- Abandoned prototype military gear
- Precious spy intelligence lost by someone

**Places:**
- Artillery-pocked wasteland
- Reeking refugee camp
- Burnt-out shell of a city

### Societal Despair

The world's dominant society has lost faith in itself. Whether through some all-consuming war, great catastrophe, overwhelming outside culture, or religious collapse, the natives no longer believe in their old values, and search desperately for something new. Fierce conflict often exists between the last believers in the old dispensation and the nihilistic or searching disciples of the new age.

**Enemies:**
- Zealot who blames outsiders for the decay
- Nihilistic warlord
- Offworlder looking to exploit the local despair

**Friends:**
- Struggling messenger of a new way
- Valiant paragon of a fading tradition
- Local going through the motions of serving a now-irrelevant role

**Complications:**
- A massive war discredited all the old values
- Outside powers are working to erode societal confidence for their own benefit
- A local power is profiting greatly from the despair
- The old ways were meant to aid survival on this world and their passing is causing many new woes

**Things:**
- Relic that would inspire a renaissance
- Art that would inspire new ideas
- Priceless artifact of a now-scorned belief

**Places:**
- Empty temple
- Crowded den of obliviating vice
- Smoky hall full of frantic speakers
