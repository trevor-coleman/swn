### Feral World

In the long, isolated night of the Silence, some worlds have experienced total moral and cultural collapse. Whatever remains has been twisted beyond recognition into assorted death cults, xenophobic fanaticism, horrific cultural practices, or other behavior unacceptable on more enlightened worlds. These worlds are almost invariably quarantined by other planets.

**Enemies:**
- Decadent noble
- Mad cultist
- Xenophobic local
- Cannibal chief
- Maltech researcher

**Friends:**
- Trapped outworlder
- Aspiring reformer
- Native wanting to avoid traditional flensing

**Complications:**
- Horrific local "celebration"
- Inexplicable and repugnant social rules
- Taboo zones and people

**Things:**
- Terribly misused piece of pretech
- Wealth accumulated through brutal evildoing
- Valuable possession owned by luckless outworlder victim

**Places:**
- Atrocity amphitheater
- Traditional torture parlor
- Ordinary location twisted into something terrible

### Anthropomorphs

The locals were originally human, but at some point became anthropomorphic, either as an ancient furry colony, a group of animal-worshiping sectarians, or gengineers who just happened to find animal elements most convenient for surviving on the world. Depending on the skill of the original gengineers, their feral forms may or may not work as well as their original human bodies, or may come with drawbacks inherited from their animal elements.

**Enemies:**
- Anthro-supremacist local
- Native driven by feral urges
- Outside exploiter who sees the locals as subhuman creatures

**Friends:**
- Fascinated genetic researcher
- Diplomat trained to deal with normals
- Local needing outside help

**Complications:**
- The locals consider their shapes a curse from their foolish ancestors
- Society is ordered according to animal forms
- The locals view normal humans as repulsive or inferior

**Things:**
- Pretech gengineering tech
- A "cure" that may not be wanted
- Sacred feral totem

**Places:**
- Shrine to a feral deity
- Nature reserve suited to an animal type
- Living site built to take advantage of animal traits
