### Night World

The world is plunged into eternal darkness. The only life on this planet derives its energy from other sources, such as geothermal heat, extremely volatile chemical reactions in the planet's soil, or light in a non-visible spectrum. Most flora and fauna is voraciously eager to consume other life.

**Enemies:**
- Monstrous thing from the night
- Offworlder finding the obscurity of the world convenient for dark purposes
- Mad scientist experimenting with local life

**Friends:**
- Curious offworlder researcher
- Hard-pressed colony leader
- High priest of a sect that finds religious significance in the night

**Complications:**
- Daylight comes as a cataclysmic event at very long intervals
- Light causes very dangerous reactions to native life or chemicals here
- The locals have been gengineered to exist without light

**Things:**
- Rare chemicals created in the darkness
- Light source usable on this world
- Smuggler cache hidden here in ages past

**Places:**
- Formlessly pitch-black wilderness
- Sea without a sun
- Location defined by sounds or smells

### Refugees

The world teems with refugees, either exiles from another planet who managed to get here, or the human detritus of some local conflict that have fled to the remaining stable states. The natives usually regard the refugees with hostility, an attitude returned by many among their unwilling guests.

**Enemies:**
- Xenophobic native leader
- Refugee chief aspiring to seize the host nation
- Politician seeking to use the refugees as a weapon

**Friends:**
- Sympathetic refugee waif
- Local hard-pressed by refugee gangs
- Clergy seeking peace

**Complications:**
- The xenophobes are right that the refugees are taking over
- The refugees are right that the xenophobes want them out or dead
- Both are right
- Outside powers are using the refugees to destabilize an enemy government
- Refugee and local cultures are extremely incompatible

**Things:**
- Treasures brought out by fleeing refugees
- Citizenship papers
- Cache of vital refugee supplies
- Hidden arms for terrorists

**Places:**
- Hopeless refugee camp
- City swarming with confused strangers
- Festival full of angry locals
