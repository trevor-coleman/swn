## Attributes
- **Temperature**: Cold
- **Population**: Several million inhabitants

Suadiyy's Sealed Menace & Local Specialty
The Situation:

The psychic dampening crystals are mined from specific veins in the frozen crust
These crystals create a planet-wide suppression field keeping something dormant
Mining operations must be carefully balanced - too much extraction weakens containment
The crystals are incredibly valuable offworld but locals restrict exports

The Menace:

Could be an ancient psionic entity/AI from pre-Scream era
Possibly a fragment of the Resonance Protocol that went mad during the Scream
Maybe a psychic plague that turns people into hivemind drones
Or pretech terraforming nanites that respond to psionic commands

Local Tensions:

Keepers - Maintain the suppression network, oppose excessive mining
Miners - Need to extract enough to maintain the economy
Smugglers - Try to steal crystals for massive offworld profits
The Ignorant - Many citizens don't know what's being suppressed

Plot Hooks:

Crystal thieves have damaged a key suppression node
The menace is showing signs of stirring - psychic dreams increasing
Someone wants to deliberately awaken it (Resonant Dawn?)
The party's psychic members (Dallas/Kaedim) might accidentally trigger something
- **Biosphere**: Human-miscible
