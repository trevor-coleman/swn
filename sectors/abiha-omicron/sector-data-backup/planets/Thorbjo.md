### Terraform Failure

This world was marginal for human habitation when it was discovered, but the Mandate or the early government put in pretech terraforming engines to correct its more extreme qualities. The terraforming did not entirely work, either failing of its own or suffering the destruction of the engines during the Silence. The natives are only partly adapted to the world's current state, and struggle with the environment.

**Enemies:**
- Brutal ruler who cares only for their people
- Offworlder trying to loot the damaged engines
- Warlord trying to seize limited habitable land

**Friends:**
- Local trying to fix the engines
- Offworlder student of the engines
- World-wise native survivor

**Complications:**
- The engines produced too much of something instead of too little
- The engines were hijacked by aliens with different preferences
- It was discovered that an earth-like environment would eventually cause a catastrophic disaster

**Things:**
- Parts to repair or restore the engines
- Lootable pretech fragments
- Valuable local tech devised to cope with the world

**Places:**
- Zone of tolerable gravity or temperature
- Native settlement built to cope with the environment
- Massive ruined terraforming engine

### Abandoned Colony

The world once hosted a colony, whether human or otherwise, until some crisis or natural disaster drove the inhabitants away or killed them off. The colony might have been mercantile in nature, an expedition to extract valuable local resources, or it might have been a reclusive cabal of zealots. The remains of the colony are usually in ruins, and might still be dangerous from the aftermath of whatever destroyed it in the first place.

**Enemies:**
- Crazed survivors
- Ruthless plunderers of the ruins
- Automated defense system

**Friends:**
- Inquisitive stellar archaeologist
- Heir to the colony's property
- Local wanting the place cleaned out and made safe

**Complications:**
- The local government wants the ruins to remain a secret
- The locals claim ownership of it
- The colony is crumbling and dangerous to navigate

**Things:**
- Long-lost property deeds
- Relic stolen by the colonists when they left
- Historical record of the colonization attempt

**Places:**
- Decaying habitation block
- Vine-covered town square
- Structure buried by an ancient landslide
