### Robots

The world has a great many robots on it. Most bots are going to be non-sentient expert systems, though an AI with enough computing resources can control many bots at once, and some worlds may have developed VIs to a degree that individual bots can seem (or be) sentient. Some worlds might even be ruled by metal overlords, ones which do not need to be sentient so long as they have overwhelming force.

**Enemies:**
- Hostile robot master
- Robot greedy to seize offworld tech
- Robot fallen in love with the pc's ship
- Oligarch whose factories build robots

**Friends:**
- Data-seeking robot
- Plucky young robot tech
- Local being pushed out of a job by robots

**Complications:**
- The robots are only partially controlled
- The robots are salvaged and originally meant for a much darker use
- The robots require a rare material that the locals fight over
- The robots require the planet's specific infrastructure so cannot be exported

**Places:**
- Humming robotic factory
- Stark robotic "barracks"

### Out of Contact

The natives have been entirely out of contact with the greater galaxy for centuries or longer. Perhaps the original colonists were seeking to hide from the rest of the universe, or the Silence destroyed any means of communication. It may have been so long that human origins on other worlds have regressed into a topic for legends. The players might be on the first offworld ship to land since the First Wave of colonization a thousand years ago.

**Enemies:**
- Fearful local ruler
- Zealous native cleric
- Sinister power that has kept the world isolated

**Friends:**
