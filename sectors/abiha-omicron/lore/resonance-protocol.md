# The Resonance Protocol

## Overview
The Resonance Protocol is a pre-Scream psionic network developed to stabilize and connect minds across vast distances. It represents the pinnacle of psychic technology development before the catastrophic Scream event.

## Core Technology
- **Dyson swarm-like computational matrix**: Designed to facilitate stable psionic network
- **Psychic anchoring system**: Requires specific psychic types for stability
- **Blue "Resonance" liquid**: Substance that triggers protocol connections and visions

## Historical Development
- Created by researchers including **Aric Valen** (whose memories Kaedim experienced)
- Required partnership between:
  - **Khyber Line psychics**: Served as stable anchors
  - **Precog Navigators**: Used as "navigational anchors" in the network
  - This partnership was exploitative, with navigators conditioned for dependency

## Key Locations
- **Site Theta**: Located in Aurelius Asteroid Belt
  - Believed to be origin point of the Protocol
  - Key to unlocking Protocol's true purpose
  - Currently sought by multiple factions

## Recent Discoveries
- **Orinda Mine Incident**: Security Chief Keller partially transformed by Protocol artifact
- **Crystalline components**: Can integrate with human biology
- **Data fragments**: Recovered by Lance during Orinda mission
- **Crystal fragment**: Extracted by Kaedim through psychic resonance

## Faction Interests
- **Stellar Dynamics**: Dangerous intentions (per Captain Reyes's warning)
- **Aurelius Consortium**: Commercial exploitation focus
- **Resonant Dawn Cult**: Religious significance, seeking transcendence
- **The Archive**: Protective stance, preventing exploitation

## Dangers & Warnings
- **Captain Reyes's Warning**: Urged destruction before Stellar Dynamics acquisition
- **Catastrophic risks**: Uncontrolled activation can destroy planets
  - Hesperis destroyed by psionic surge technology
  - Similar fate befell planet Thorunn
- **Biological transformation**: Direct exposure can alter human physiology

## Current Status
- Components scattered throughout Abiha Omicron sector
- Multiple facilities and research bases contain pieces
- Party possesses:
  - Crystal fragment (Kaedim)
  - Data fragments (Lance)
  - Knowledge from Archive texts
  - Direct experience through visions

## Potential Applications
- More than just communication network
- Possible weapon applications (may have triggered the Scream)
- Could potentially prevent another Scream-like event
- Faction control over psychics
- Enhancement of psychic abilities

## Connection to Current Events
- Aurelius Jump Gate may use similar technology
- Archive contains extensive documentation
- Party's arrival through jumpgate suggests Protocol involvement
- Dallas-Kaedim pairing mirrors historical Navigator-Khyber relationship
