# The Aurelius Jump Gate

## Overview
A cluster of unusual asteroids arranged in a complex three-dimensional pattern within the Aurelius Belt. These aren't ordinary space rocks - they're composed of psychically resonant materials that somehow function as a jump gate when properly aligned and activated. Since the party's passage, the formation has gone dormant, its energy signature fading rapidly.

## Physical Description
The asteroids vary in size from small boulders to masses the size of small moons. Their surfaces are etched with strange angular patterns that pulse faintly with residual energy. The central area where the Starfall Whisper emerged shows signs of instability:
- Micro-fractures spreading across several key asteroids
- Energy discharge points that appear damaged or depleted
- Visible crystalline structures similar to Resonance Protocol artifacts

## Current Status
**INACTIVE** - The gate is currently non-functional
- Psychic resonance dropped to minimal levels
- Unknown if due to:
  - Damage from party's transition
  - Need for recharge cycle
  - Missing components
  - Intentional shutdown
- Return travel not possible without intervention

## Observer Activity
The party's emergence attracted significant attention:
- Mining vessels maintaining safe distance while deploying sensor drones
- Encrypted communications spike across multiple channels
- At least one Resonant Dawn vessel observed (crew visibly excited)
- Aurelius Consortium vessels conducting detailed scans
- Several unidentified ships maintaining observation positions

## Significance
- First recorded activation in modern times
- Proves functional jumpgate technology still exists
- Creates strategic importance for Aurelius Belt location
- Links to broader Resonance Protocol mystery

## Connection to Party
- Method of party's arrival in sector
- Creates ongoing vulnerability (can't leave same way)
- Marks party as subjects of interest to multiple factions
- Possible connection to Navigator-Khyber pairing
