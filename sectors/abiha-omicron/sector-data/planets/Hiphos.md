- **Tags**: [{'name': 'Pilgrimage Site', 'description': 'The world is noted for an important spiritual or historical location, and might be the sector headquarters for a widespread religion or political movement. The site attracts wealthy pilgrims from throughout nearby space, and those with the money necessary to manage interstellar travel can be quite generous to the site and its keepers. The locals tend to be fiercely protective of the place and its reputation, and some places may forbid the entrance of those not suitably pious or devout.', 'enemies': ['Saboteur devoted to a rival belief', 'Bitter reformer who resents the current leadership', 'Swindler conning the pilgrims'], 'friends': ['Protector of the holy site', 'Naive offworlder pilgrim', "Outsider wanting to learn the sanctum's inner secrets"], 'complications': ['The site is actually a fake', 'The site is run by corrupt and venal keepers', 'A natural disaster threatens the site'], 'things': ['Ancient relic guarded at the site', "Proof of the site's inauthenticity", 'Precious offerings from a pilgrim'], 'places': ['Incense-scented sanctum', 'Teeming crowd of pilgrims', 'Imposing holy structure']}, {'name': 'Maneaters', 'description': 'The locals are cannibals, either out of necessity or out of cultural preference.
