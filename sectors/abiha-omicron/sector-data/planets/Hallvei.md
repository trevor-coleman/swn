Most bots are going to be non-sentient expert systems, though an AI with enough computing resources can control many bots at once, and some worlds may have developed VIs to a degree that individual bots can seem (or be) sentient. Some worlds might even be ruled by metal overlords, ones which do not need to be sentient so long as they have overwhelming force.', 'enemies': ['Hostile robot master', 'Robot greedy to seize offworld tech', "Robot fallen in love with the pc's ship", 'Oligarch whose factories build robots'], 'friends': ['Data-seeking robot', 'Plucky young robot tech', 'Local being pushed out of a job by robots'], 'complications': ['The robots are only partially controlled', 'The robots are salvaged and originally meant for a much darker use', 'The robots require a rare material that the locals fight over', "The robots require the planet's specific infrastructure so cannot be exported"], 'things': ['Prototype robot', 'Secret robot override codes', 'Vast cache of robot-made goods', 'Robot-destroying pretech weapon'], 'places': ['Humming robotic factory', 'Stark robotic "barracks"', 'House crowded with robot servants and only one human owner']}, {'name': 'Out of Contact', 'description': 'The natives have been entirely out of contact with the greater galaxy for centuries or longer.
