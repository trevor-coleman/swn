### Dying Race

The inhabitants of this world are dying out, and they know it. Through environmental toxins, hostile bio-weapons, or sheer societal despair, the culture cannot replenish its numbers. Members seek meaning in their own strange goals or peculiar faiths, though a few might struggle to find some way to reverse their slow yet inevitable doom.

**Enemies:**
- Hostile outsider who wants the locals dead
- Offwolder seeking to take advantage of their weakened state
- Invaders eager to push the locals out of their former lands

**Friends:**
- One of the few youth among the population
- Determined and hopeful reformer
- Researcher seeking a new method of reproduction

**Complications:**
- The dying culture's values were monstrous
- The race's death is somehow necessary to prevent some grand catastrophe
- The race is somehow convinced they deserve this fate

**Things:**
- Extremely valuable reproductive tech
- Treasured artifacts of the former age
- Bioweapon used on the race

**Places:**
- City streets devoid of pedestrians
- Mighty edifice now crumbling with disrepair
- Small dwelling full of people in a town now otherwise empty

### Prison Planet

This planet is or was intended as a prison. Some such prisons were meant for specific malefactors of the Terran Mandate, while others were to contain entire "dangerous" ethnic groups or alien races. Some may still have warden AIs or automatic systems to prevent any unauthorized person from leaving, and any authorization permits have long since expired.

**Enemies:**
- Crazed warden ai
- Brutal heir to gang leadership
- Offworlder who's somehow acquired warden powers and exploits the locals

**Friends:**
- Innocent local born here
- Native technician forced to maintain the very tech that imprisons them
- Offworlder trapped here by accident

**Complications:**
- Departure permits are a precious currency
- The prison industry still makes valuable pretech devices
- Gangs have metamorphosed into governments
- The local nobility descended from the prison staff

**Things:**
- A pass to get offworld
- A key to bypass ancient security devices
- Contraband forbidden by the security scanners

**Places:**
- Mandate-era prison block converted to government building
- Industrial facility manned by mandatory numbers of prisoners
- Makeshift shop where contraband is assembled
