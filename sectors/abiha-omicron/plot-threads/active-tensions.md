# Active Plot Threads & Tensions

*For chronological context see [Timeline](../TIMELINE.md) | For faction details see [Faction Tracker](../FACTION-TRACKER.md)*

## Immediate Threats

### The Silence Architects - UNIVERSE-LEVEL THREAT
- **Status**: CRITICAL - One identified, two unknown
- **Revelation**: The Scream was deliberate genocide ([Lance's discovery](../sessions/2025-06-12-lances-psychonaut-journey.md))
- **Personal Connection**: Party has met one disguised as info broker
- **Current Risk**: Architects alerted to investigation
- **Assets**: Grand Nexus location, master override codes
- **Danger**: May trigger another Scream-level event
- **Related**: [Lore](../../cross-sector/factions/silence-architects.md), [The Scream Truth](../../cross-sector/lore/the-scream-truth.md)

### Lance's Neural Condition
- **Status**: CRITICAL - Recovering
- **Context**: Failed disconnect from Resonant Dawn network ([Sanctuary incident](../sessions/2025-05-30-resonant-dawn-sanctuary.md))
- **Risk**: Potential transformation like the Interpreter
- **New Ability**: [Network Echo](../abilities/network-echo.md) grants Protocol memory access
- **Management**: Must limit use to avoid further damage
- **Advantage**: Can access Architect memories
- **Character**: [Lance Bahringer](../party/lance-bahringer.md)

### Archive Judgment
- **Status**: RESOLVED (off-screen during Lance's journey)
- **Outcome**: Unknown - party fled during sanctuary crisis
- **Related**: [Archive Arrival](../sessions/2025-05-01-archive-arrival.md), [Isa](../characters/isa-archive-authority.md)

### Aurelius Consortium Pursuit
- **Status**: ESCALATED - Direct Combat
- **Context**: Engaged consortium forces at [Battle of Cou](../sessions/2025-06-12-cou-approach-battle.md)
- **Recent**: Destroyed 2 patrol boats, disabled corvette *Profit Margin*
- **Assets**: Protocol tracking device, black box data on party
- **Knowledge**: Now has [Starfall Whisper's](../party/starfall-whisper.md) full identity
- **Warning**: Commander Zhou: "Some prizes cost more than ships"
- **Faction**: [Aurelius Consortium](../factions/aurelius-consortium.md)

## Major Discoveries

### Ur-Resonance
- **New Discovery**: Original Protocol seed consciousness
- **Source**: Interpreter's final revelation to refugees ([Sanctuary](../sessions/2025-05-30-resonant-dawn-sanctuary.md))
- **Nature**: Pre-human in origin
- **Access**: Requires three keys
- **Connection**: May explain shackles on [Cou](../sector-data/planets/Cou.md)
- **Carriers**: Sister Meris and [Harmonic Prayer refugees](../sessions/2025-06-12-cou-approach-battle.md)

### Navigator-Khyber Connection
- **Revelation**: [Dallas](../party/dallas-jacobi.md) and [Kaedim](../party/kaedim-vecc.md) show unusual compatibility patterns
- **Historical Context**: Navigators were historically exploited by [Khyber lineage](../lore/khyber-line.md)
- **Archive Founded**: By escaped navigators opposing Khyber control ([Archive Experience](../sessions/2025-05-07-archive-experience.md))
- **Question**: Is their meeting coincidence or manipulation?

### Resonance Protocol
- **Artifacts**: Crystal fragment (Kaedim), corrupted key data ([Kaedim's gauntlet](../items/kaedim-gauntlet.md))
- **Locations**: Site Theta ([Aurelius Belt](../sector-data/locations/Aurelius Belt.md)), Grand Nexus (drill-space)
- **Competing Interests**: [Aurelius Consortium](../factions/aurelius-consortium.md), ~~[Resonant Dawn cult](../factions/resonant-dawn.md)~~ (destroyed)
- **Danger**: Security Chief Keller partially transformed by exposure ([Orinda Rescue](../sessions/2025-03-27-orinda-mine-rescue.md))
- **New Understanding**: Tool used by Architects to trigger the Scream
- **Dallas's Coordinates**: 2847.3/-891.2/-3 (Grand Nexus location)
- **Lore**: [Resonance Protocol](../lore/resonance-protocol.md), [Protocol Key Fragments](../lore/protocol-key-fragments.md)

### Aurelius Jump Gate
- **Status**: Currently dormant after party's arrival
- **Problem**: No return travel possible without intervention
- **Interest**: Multiple factions studying the phenomenon
- **Significance**: Party's arrival method draws unwanted attention
- **Lore**: [Aurelius Jumpgate](../lore/aurelius-jumpgate.md)

## Faction Conflicts

### Aurelius Consortium vs Resonant Dawn
- **Competition**: Both seeking Resonance Protocol artifacts
- **Consortium**: Commercial exploitation focus
- **Cult**: Religious significance and transcendence
- **Party Position**: Caught between, possessing key artifacts

### Archive vs Outside World
- **Archive Mission**: Preserve knowledge, prevent exploitation
- **Outside Pressure**: Multiple factions want Archive's jumpgate texts
- **Party Access**: Gained significant knowledge about jumpgates
- **Future Risk**: May become targets for this knowledge

## Character-Specific Tensions

### Dallas
- Precognitive abilities make him valuable to multiple factions
- Historical navigator exploitation creates ethical concerns
- Potential dependency issues with Kaedim (per historical patterns)

### Kaedim
- Khyber lineage marks him as historically problematic
- Gauntlet's power creates both opportunity and danger
- Archive judgment determines immediate future

### Lance
- Carries sensitive Nexus data and pretech salvage
- Hacking skills make him both asset and liability
- Altered neurochemistry noted as "unconventional" by Archive
- **NEW**: Network Echo ability allows Protocol memory access
- Risk of transformation if ability overused
- Currently recovering from neural entanglement

### Adrian
- Medical knowledge crucial for understanding biological effects
- Successfully extracted Keller but long-term effects unknown

## Unresolved Questions

1. What is the full nature of the Resonance Protocol?
2. Who or what manipulated Dallas and Kaedim's meeting?
3. Can the Aurelius Jump Gate be reactivated?
4. ~~What are the Resonant Dawn's true capabilities?~~ (Cult destroyed)
5. Which information broker is the Architect?
6. What happened to the lost party member Taka?
7. Why did the Architects trigger the Scream?
8. Are there contingencies if all Architects die?
9. What does the master override actually do?

## Potential Allies

- **[Penticton 9](../sector-data/locations/Penticton 9.md)**: Grateful for repairs, potential safe harbor ([Session](../sessions/2025-04-04-penticton-9.md))
- **The Archive**: If judgment passed, powerful knowledge ally ([NPC: Isa](../characters/isa-archive-authority.md))
- **[Gaius Carranzo](../characters/gaius-carranzo.md)**: New recruit, unknown loyalties ([Stats](../characters/gaius-carranzo-stats.md))
- **Orinda Survivors**: 14 grateful individuals with insider knowledge ([Rescue](../sessions/2025-03-27-orinda-mine-rescue.md))

## Next Steps
- ~~Survive Archive judgment~~ (Resolved off-screen)
- Evade Aurelius Consortium ([Current pursuit](../sessions/2025-06-12-cou-approach-battle.md))
- Decide how to use Resonance Protocol knowledge
- Find safe harbor ([37 Labria](../sector-data/locations/37 Labria.md) suggested)
- Investigate jumpgate restoration possibilities
- Rescue [Harmonic Prayer refugees](../planning/next-session/harmonic-prayer-rescue-prep.md)
