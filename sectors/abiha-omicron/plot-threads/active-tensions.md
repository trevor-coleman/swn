# Active Plot Threads & Tensions

*For chronological context see [Timeline](../TIMELINE.md) | For faction details see [Faction Tracker](../FACTION-TRACKER.md)*

## Immediate Threats

### The Silence Architects - UNIVERSE-LEVEL THREAT
- **Status**: CRITICAL - One identified, two unknown
- **Revelation**: The Scream was deliberate genocide ([Lance's discovery](../sessions/2025-06-12-lances-psychonaut-journey.md))
- **Personal Connection**: Party has met one disguised as info broker
- **Current Risk**: Architects alerted to investigation
- **Assets**: Grand Nexus location, master override codes
- **Danger**: May trigger another Scream-level event
- **Related**: [Lore](../../cross-sector/factions/silence-architects.md), [The Scream Truth](../../cross-sector/lore/the-scream-truth.md)

### Lance's Neural Condition
- **Status**: CRITICAL - Recovering
- **Context**: Failed disconnect from Resonant Dawn network ([Sanctuary incident](../sessions/2025-05-30-resonant-dawn-sanctuary.md))
- **Risk**: Potential transformation like the Interpreter
- **New Ability**: [Network Echo](../../../party/lance-bahringer/network-echo-ability.md) grants Protocol memory access
- **Recent Use**: Successfully extracted Ur-Resonance coordinates from dying Sister Meris ([Harmonic Prayer rescue](../sessions/2025-06-26-harmonic-prayer-rescue.md))
- **Management**: Must limit use to avoid further damage
- **Advantage**: Can access Architect memories and Protocol knowledge
- **Character**: [Lance Bahringer](../../../party/lance-bahringer/character-sheet.md)

### Archive Judgment
- **Status**: RESOLVED (off-screen during Lance's journey)
- **Outcome**: Unknown - party fled during sanctuary crisis
- **Related**: [Archive Arrival](../sessions/2025-05-01-archive-arrival.md), [Isa](../characters/isa-archive-authority.md)

### Aurelius Consortium Pursuit - ARCHITECT COMPROMISED
- **Status**: CATASTROPHIC - Asset Recovery Teams are Architect servants
- **Context**: Engaged consortium forces at [Battle of Cou](../sessions/2025-06-12-cou-approach-battle.md)
- **Recent Horror**: Asset Recovery Team Gamma arrived and consumed *Profit Margin* ([Harmonic Prayer rescue](../sessions/2025-06-26-harmonic-prayer-rescue.md))
- **True Nature**: Protocol-corrupted hybrid ships serving "older masters" (Architects)
- **Capabilities**: 
  - Tear through spacetime without spike drives
  - Crystalline sensors track Protocol signatures
  - Corruption beam enslaves ship crews
  - Compress starships into hyperdense spheres
- **Current Threat**: Two Cou patrols corrupted, one dead, spacetime scars healing
- **Zhou's Message**: "The real prize swims deeper" - he may have known
- **Faction**: [Aurelius Consortium](../factions/aurelius-consortium.md) - possibly always compromised

## Major Discoveries

### Ur-Resonance
- **New Discovery**: Original Protocol seed consciousness
- **Source**: Interpreter's final revelation, confirmed by Sister Meris ([Harmonic Prayer rescue](../sessions/2025-06-26-harmonic-prayer-rescue.md))
- **Nature**: Pre-human in origin, shackles were "incubators" not prisons
- **Access**: Requires three anchor points:
  - Cou's north pole shackle control node (3.7 AU - something acknowledged beacon)
  - Gravitational anomaly in Solano's storms
  - Deepest point in Cou's Maratos Trench
- **Requirements**: Syzygy alignment and consciousness integration
- **Connection**: Something massive sleeping beneath Cou - "The pattern completes"
- **Data Retrieved**: Complete approach vectors from cultist data cores

### Navigator-Khyber Connection
- **Revelation**: [Dallas](../../../party/dallas-jacobi/character-sheet.md) and [Kaedim](../../../party/kaedim-vecc/character-sheet.md) show unusual compatibility patterns
- **Historical Context**: Navigators were historically exploited by [Khyber lineage](../lore/khyber-line.md)
- **Archive Founded**: By escaped navigators opposing Khyber control ([Archive Experience](../sessions/2025-05-07-archive-experience.md))
- **Question**: Is their meeting coincidence or manipulation?

### Resonance Protocol
- **Artifacts**: Crystal fragment (Kaedim), corrupted key data ([Kaedim's gauntlet](../../../party/kaedim-vecc/kaedim-gauntlet.md)), Protocol tracker (trusts Kaedim)
- **Locations**: Site Theta ([Aurelius Belt](../systems/campera/aurelius-belt/belt--aurelius-belt.md)), Grand Nexus (drill-space)
- **Competing Interests**: [Aurelius Consortium](../factions/aurelius-consortium.md), ~~[Resonant Dawn cult](../factions/resonant-dawn.md)~~ (destroyed)
- **Danger**: Security Chief Keller partially transformed by exposure ([Orinda Rescue](../sessions/2025-03-27-orinda-mine-rescue.md))
- **New Understanding**: Tool used by Architects to trigger the Scream
- **Dallas's Coordinates**: 2847.3/-891.2/-3 (Grand Nexus location)
- **Lore**: [Resonance Protocol](../lore/resonance-protocol.md), [Protocol Key Fragments](../lore/protocol-key-fragments.md)

### Protocol Network Discovery
- **Revelation**: Network of preserved Protocol nodes exists, trying to reunite ([Harmonic Prayer rescue](../sessions/2025-06-26-harmonic-prayer-rescue.md))
- **Node Status**: Some corrupted by Silence Architects, others remain pure
- **Communication**: Nodes can recognize and communicate with each other
- **Party Asset**: Protocol tracker synchronized with Kaedim through empathy
- **Tracker Abilities**: Can sense corrupted vs pure Protocol signatures
- **Implications**: Multiple Protocol artifacts may be seeking reunion
- **Zhou's Knowledge**: Knew about network - "The real prize swims deeper"

### Aurelius Jump Gate
- **Status**: Currently dormant after party's arrival
- **Problem**: No return travel possible without intervention
- **Interest**: Multiple factions studying the phenomenon
- **Significance**: Party's arrival method draws unwanted attention
- **Lore**: [Aurelius Jumpgate](../lore/aurelius-jumpgate.md)

## Faction Conflicts

### Aurelius Consortium vs Resonant Dawn
- **Competition**: Both seeking Resonance Protocol artifacts
- **Consortium**: Commercial exploitation focus
- **Cult**: Religious significance and transcendence
- **Party Position**: Caught between, possessing key artifacts

### Archive vs Outside World
- **Archive Mission**: Preserve knowledge, prevent exploitation
- **Outside Pressure**: Multiple factions want Archive's jumpgate texts
- **Party Access**: Gained significant knowledge about jumpgates
- **Future Risk**: May become targets for this knowledge

## Character-Specific Tensions

### Dallas
- Precognitive abilities make him valuable to multiple factions
- Historical navigator exploitation creates ethical concerns
- Potential dependency issues with Kaedim (per historical patterns)
- **Recent**: Enhanced perception under hallucinogens, philosophical ship insights

### Kaedim
- Khyber lineage marks him as historically problematic
- Gauntlet's power creates both opportunity and danger
- **NEW**: Successfully synchronized with Protocol tracker through empathy
- **NEW**: Can distinguish corrupted vs pure Protocol signatures
- **CRITICAL**: Learned to force Protocol into dormancy with Effort
- **CRITICAL**: "Philosophical nonsense" confuses Protocol sensors
- **Recent**: Gauntlet supercharged with Protocol energy, took additional System Strain
- Carrying 40kg Protocol tracker that trusts him (1 Effort committed to silence)

### Lance
- Carries sensitive Nexus data and pretech salvage
- Hacking skills make him both asset and liability
- Altered neurochemistry noted as "unconventional" by Archive
- **NEW**: Network Echo ability allows Protocol memory access
- **Recent**: Successfully extracted complete Ur-Resonance coordinates from Sister Meris
- **Recent**: Maintained 40-70 minute remote hack on Profit Margin
- Risk of transformation if ability overused
- Currently affected by own hallucinogenic gas

### Adrian
- Medical knowledge crucial for understanding biological effects
- Successfully extracted Keller but long-term effects unknown
- **Recent**: Retrieved critical Ur-Resonance data cores from cultists
- **Recent**: Managing drug-affected refugees and crew

## Unresolved Questions

1. What is the full nature of the Resonance Protocol?
2. Who or what manipulated Dallas and Kaedim's meeting?
3. Can the Aurelius Jump Gate be reactivated?
4. ~~What are the Resonant Dawn's true capabilities?~~ (Cult destroyed)
5. Which information broker is the Architect?
6. What happened to the lost party member Taka?
7. Why did the Architects trigger the Scream?
8. Are there contingencies if all Architects die?
9. What does the master override actually do?
10. What is "the real prize" that "swims deeper" according to Zhou?
11. What acknowledged the beacon at Cou's north pole (3.7 AU)?
12. What massive thing sleeps beneath Cou?
13. Why were the shackles "incubators" not prisons?
14. **How long has Aurelius Consortium been Architect-compromised?**
15. **How many Asset Recovery Teams exist?**
16. **What happens during "asset processing" in drill-space?**
17. **Can corrupted patrol crews be saved?**

## Potential Allies

- **[Penticton 9](../systems/meliadi-viii/37-labria/locations/asteroidbase--penticton-9.md)**: Grateful for repairs, potential safe harbor ([Session](../sessions/2025-04-04-penticton-9.md))
- **The Archive**: If judgment passed, powerful knowledge ally ([NPC: Isa](../characters/isa-archive-authority.md))
- **[Gaius Carranzo](../characters/gaius-carranzo.md)**: New recruit, currently affected by hallucinogens ([Stats](../characters/gaius-carranzo-stats.md))
- **Orinda Survivors**: 14 grateful individuals with insider knowledge ([Rescue](../sessions/2025-03-27-orinda-mine-rescue.md))
- **Resonant Dawn Refugees**: 19 cultists with Ur-Resonance knowledge ([Harmonic Prayer rescue](../sessions/2025-06-26-harmonic-prayer-rescue.md))

## Next Steps
- ~~Survive Archive judgment~~ (Resolved off-screen)
- ~~Rescue Harmonic Prayer refugees~~ (Completed - 19 survivors)
- ~~Evade Cou patrol investigating Profit Margin~~ (Corrupted/destroyed by Asset Recovery Team)
- **IMMEDIATE**: Escape Cou system before authorities investigate missing patrols
- **CRITICAL**: Avoid all Aurelius ships - they may be Architect servants
- **URGENT**: Wait for drugs to wear off (1-2 hours) before major decisions
- Decide how to approach Ur-Resonance (three anchor points known)
- Find safe harbor ([37 Labria](../systems/meliadi-viii/37-labria/belt--37-labria.md) suggested)
- Let Protocol tracker guide party to other nodes (after releasing dormancy)
- Investigate what's at Cou's north pole (3.7 AU) - but it acknowledged the beacon
- Manage 19 cultist refugees and their integration
- **NEW**: Develop "philosophical nonsense" as Protocol defense
