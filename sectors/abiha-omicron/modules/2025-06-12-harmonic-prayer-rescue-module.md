# Module: Harmonic Prayer Rescue

## Overview
The cultist ship *Harmonic Prayer* spins out of control following the destruction of the Resonant Dawn cathedral-station. With 23 refugees aboard and critical Archive data at risk, the party must execute a dangerous rescue before Cou patrols arrive or the ship tears itself apart.

## Scene 1: The Spinning Derelict

### Approach

**Read Aloud:**
> Through the viewscreen, you see the *Harmonic Prayer* tumbling in a sickening three-axis spin against Cou's stormy atmosphere. The ship vents crystalline atmosphere that glitters in the planet's reflected light. Adrian, your console shows the spin rate: 4.3 rotations per minute. Debris from the earlier battle creates a navigational hazard of spinning metal and frozen fluids.

**GM Information:**
- Distance to Harmonic Prayer: 10km
- Debris field: -2 to Pilot checks
- Time until Cou patrol: 35 minutes
- 23 refugees aboard in various conditions

### Docking Challenge

**The Spinning Ship:**
- **Base Pilot DC**: 12 to match rotation
- **Quick Dock** (under 5 minutes): DC 14
- **Perfect Sync** (no damage): DC 16
- **Failure**: Starfall Whisper takes 1d6 damage, lose 1d6 minutes

**Complications (roll d6):**
1-2: Debris impact during approach (+1d4 damage)
3-4: Harmonic Prayer fires emergency thrusters (reroll Pilot)
5: Power surge creates sensor blind spot (-2 to checks)
6: Hull breach vents directly at Starfall Whisper

## Scene 2: Boarding the Harmonic Prayer

### Airlock Entry

**Read Aloud:**
> Kaedim, as the airlock seals behind you, your gauntlet immediately begins to hum—there's Protocol resonance everywhere. The ship's rotation makes 'down' a constantly shifting concept. Emergency lighting casts moving shadows as the corridor ahead curves up and away. 
> 
> Dallas, you smell ozone and something else—burnt neural tissue. From somewhere deeper in the ship comes a rhythmic banging, metal on metal, keeping time with the ship's spin.

**Environmental Hazards:**
- **Shifting Gravity**: Dex/Exert DC 10 each scene or fall 1d6 damage
- **Failing Life Support**: Con save DC 8 after 20 minutes (1d4 damage)
- **Structural Collapse**: 1-in-6 chance per room explored

### Central Hub - Archive Chamber

**Read Aloud:**
> Adrian, the blast doors part to reveal chaos. Data cores line the walls, some sparking, others melted into abstract sculptures. In the center, Brother Hadrim clutches a sealed case to his chest, blood seeping from his ears. 'The Ur-Resonance,' he gasps. 'The Interpreter saw it. Pre-human. Beautiful. Terrible.'
> 
> Lance, your Network Echo ability triggers involuntarily—the room is saturated with memory fragments. Behind Hadrim, three cultists rock in place, their eyes rolled back, whispering in unison: 'The pattern completes. The pattern completes.'

**NPCs Present:**

**Brother Hadrim** - Archive Keeper
- **HP**: 3/8, **AC**: 10, **Skills**: Know+1, Administer+1
- **Condition**: Neural bleed from archive exposure
- **Carries**: Sealed archive case (Ur-Resonance location data)
- **Wants**: Someone worthy to receive the data
- **Secret**: Knows one refugee is an imposter

**Catatonic Cultists** (3)
- **HP**: 1, **AC**: 10
- **Condition**: Lost in shared memory loop
- **Danger**: Will attack if Ur-Resonance mentioned loudly

**Hidden**: Initiate Yvel watches from ventilation grate (Notice DC 12)

### Medical Bay - Sister Meris

**Read Aloud:**
> Gaius, you're the first through the med bay doors. Sister Meris floats in the center of the room, secured by medical restraints that spark with electricity. Her eyes are open but wrong—the irises shift through unnatural colors. When she sees you, she smiles.
> 
> 'The porter,' she says, her voice harmonizing with itself. 'You were at the convergence. You all were.' She turns to look directly at Kaedim. 'The gauntlet remembers what the Interpreter knew. I remember what he became.'

**Sister Meris** - Transformed Cultist
- **HP**: 15, **AC**: 14, **Save**: 12+
- **Attacks**: Psychic scream (1d8, 10m radius) or TK slam (1d6+2)
- **Condition**: Partially integrated with Interpreter's consciousness
- **Knowledge**: Location of Ur-Resonance, true nature of shackles
- **Trigger**: Becomes violent if restrained removed
- **Weakness**: Kaedim's gauntlet can disrupt her connection

**Medical Supplies**:
- 3 Lazarus patches (1d6+1 healing)
- Sedatives (Mental save DC 12 or unconscious)
- Neural stabilizer (prevents psychic damage for 1 hour)

## Scene 3: Engineering Section

### Critical Systems

**Read Aloud:**
> The engineering section reeks of burnt electronics and something organic. Initiate Koris works frantically at a console, trying to stabilize the ship's spin. "The harmonics are fighting the navigation system," he shouts over the alarm klaxons. "The ship thinks it's still in drill-space!"

**Technical Challenges:**
- Fix DC 13: Stabilize rotation (reduces spin by half)
- Program DC 12: Convince ship it's in normal space
- Notice DC 11: Spot sabotaged power coupling

**Initiate Koris** - Tech-Specialist
- **HP**: 5, **AC**: 10, **Skills**: Fix+2, Program+1
- **Condition**: Exhausted but determined
- **Knowledge**: Ship's systems, location of survivors
- **Secret**: Noticed one refugee acting suspicious

## Scene 4: Final Countdown

### System Failure Cascade

**Read Aloud:**
> Adrian, your commpad screams alerts—Harmonic Prayer's reactor is going critical. The spin increases as structural supports fail. Lance, through the viewport, you see Cou's defense grid suddenly flare to life, orange targeting lasers sweeping space. 
> 
> Kaedim, your gauntlet burns cold. The Protocol fragment you downloaded resonates with something vast approaching from Cou's direction. Gaius shouts from the corridor: 'The refugees—they're saying the shackles aren't failing. They're opening!'

**Escape Challenges**:
- **Pilot DC 14**: Undock from spinning ship
- **Program DC 12**: Calculate jump vector through debris
- **Shoot DC 13**: Point defense against Cou drones
- **Notice DC 11**: Spot optimal escape route

**What's Really Happening**:
- Harmonic Prayer's core overloading from Protocol resonance
- Ship's spin increasing as structure fails
- Refugee panic spreading
- 5 rounds until catastrophic explosion
- Meris's integration accelerating due to stress

## NPCs Quick Reference

### Refugees (Roll d6 for each group encountered)
1. **Terrified**: Hide, may have useful information if calmed
2. **Helpful**: Assist with evacuation, know ship layout
3. **Catatonic**: Neural damage, dead weight
4. **Aggressive**: Attack anyone, believe party are demons
5. **Suspicious**: One is the imposter (Consortium spy)
6. **Transformed**: Partially integrated, speaks in harmonics

### The Imposter
**"Initiate Koris"** - Actually Consortium Agent
- **HP**: 6, **AC**: 11, **Skills**: Talk+1, Sneak+1
- **Mission**: Steal archive data, report to Consortium
- **Tell**: Too calm, asks specific questions about Protocol
- **Discovery**: Lance's Network Echo shows no cult memories

## Treasures & Data

### From Harmonic Prayer
- **Ur-Resonance Location**: Encoded coordinates requiring three keys
- **Interpreter's Research**: +2 to next Protocol-related Program check
- **Cult Database**: Names and locations of sector cultists
- **Warning**: "The Solano emergence was always the plan"

### Additional Discoveries
- **Navigation Logs**: Last jump calculations from Resonant Dawn
- **Medical Data**: Neural transformation progression charts
- **Emergency Beacon**: Can call for help (but who will answer?)
- **Fuel Reserves**: Enough for one emergency jump

## Consequences & Hooks

### If Archives Saved
- Learn Ur-Resonance location requires keys from three worlds
- Discover shackles were built to contain it
- Gain map to other Protocol sites

### If Meris Saved
- She becomes unstable guide to deeper mysteries
- Can interface with Protocol sites
- Knows which information broker is the Architect

### If Ship Explodes
- Debris field complicates escape
- Some refugees may be lost
- Data cores destroyed
- Cou authorities alerted immediately

### If They Take Too Long
- Cou defense grid fully activates
- Solano emergence accelerates
- Must flee without full intel

## Next Scene Seeds
- Rescued refugees need medical attention and debriefing
- Ur-Resonance data requires decryption
- Cou's shackles beginning to fail planetside
- Sister Meris's transformation accelerating
- Other Protocol sites becoming active
