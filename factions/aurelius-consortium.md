# The Aurelius Consortium

## Overview
The Aurelius Consortium is a powerful resource extraction conglomerate that dominates mining operations throughout the Abiha Omicron sector. Founded during the early recovery period after the Scream, the Consortium began as a collection of independent mining operations that merged for survival and has since evolved into a quasi-governmental entity in systems where they maintain a strong presence.

## Structure and Leadership
- **Board of Directors**: Twelve executives representing major shareholders and regional interests
- **Director-General Vann Harek**: Current operational head, pragmatic and expansion-focused
- **Regional Administrators**: Oversee operations in specific systems
- **Facility Managers**: Run individual mining operations with significant autonomy
- **Contract Security Division**: Former military personnel providing protection for assets

## Core Operations
- Gas giant atmospheric extraction (specialized in rare noble gases)
- Asteroid belt mining and processing
- Pretech salvage operations (officially sanctioned but discreet)
- Resource transportation and refinement
- Equipment manufacturing and maintenance

## Notable Assets
- Fleet of specialized mining vessels and gas skimmers
- The Aurelius Belt - named after their flagship mining operation
- Numerous processing facilities throughout the sector
- TL4 extraction technology with some recovered pretech enhancements
- Extensive survey data of resource-rich systems
- Private security force equipped with corporate-grade weapons and armor
- **Helios Shard**: Stealth observation vessel currently pursuing party

## Political Position
- Maintains official mining rights in multiple systems
- Operates as de facto government in remote mining outposts
- Carefully neutral in most political conflicts to maintain business relationships
- Heavily invested in maintaining stable shipping lanes between operations

## Current Objectives
- Expand operations into the Pantopo system's gas giants
- Investigate unusual energy signatures detected in deeper atmospheric layers
- Recover and identify pretech components for potential monetization
- Maintain competitive advantage against rival extraction companies
- Negotiate favorable terms with local governments for new mining rights
- **Acquire Resonance Protocol artifacts from party**

## Relation to The Resonance Protocol
- Recently discovered components believed to be connected to Site Theta
- Research division studying unusual energy patterns in recovered artifacts
- Competing with Resonant Dawn cult for access to pretech sites
- Unaware of the full significance of their discoveries
- Primarily interested in commercial applications rather than historical importance
- **Orinda Mine Project**: Site of catastrophic Protocol containment failure

## Methods and Tactics
- Leverages economic influence to gain political advantages
- Employs reconnaissance drones to identify valuable resource deposits
- Maintains public front of legal compliance while engaging in selective rule-bending
- Uses contract specialists for potentially dangerous or questionable operations
