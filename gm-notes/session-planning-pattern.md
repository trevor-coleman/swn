## Pre-Session Information Gathering

1. **Review Current Status**
   - Where did last session end?
   - What immediate decisions face the party?
   - What resources/abilities do they currently have?
   - What injuries/conditions affect them?

2. **Identify Destination/Objective**
   - Where are they going?
   - What do they want there?
   - What obstacles exist?
   - Who else wants the same thing?

3. **Research Location Data**
   - Check sector data for planet/location details
   - Note environmental hazards
   - Identify local factions
   - Find interesting situations/hooks
