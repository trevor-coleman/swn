# Content Generation Style Guide

## Session Plan Format
When creating session plans, format them like published RPG modules with:
- Set pieces/scenarios with all necessary information
- Flavor text for important NPCs and locations
- Complete mechanical information (SWN stats, DCs, etc.)
- Clear scene transitions and options

## Flavor Text Guidelines

### Voice
- Write as DM addressing players directly in-game
- Use second person: "You see..." not "The party sees..."
- Address specific players by character name when appropriate
- Example: "Lance, you notice the console flickering..." or "Dallas, as you enter the room..."

### Content
- Describe sensory experiences (sight, sound, smell, touch, taste)
- Paint the external reality without assuming player emotions
- Players control their characters' feelings and reactions
- Keep descriptions relatively short and punchy

### What TO Include
- What characters observe
- Environmental details
- NPC appearances and actions
- Sounds, smells, textures
- Immediate threats or opportunities

### What NOT to Include
- How characters feel
- What characters think
- Player actions or decisions
- Internal character reactions
- Assumptions about player responses

## Example Format

### Scene: The Derelict Bridge

**Read Aloud:**
"Dallas, as the airlock cycles open, stale air rushes past carrying the metallic scent of old blood. Emergency lights strobe red across buckled deck plates. Kaedim, you spot deep gouges in the wallsâ€”claw marks wider than your hand."

**GM Notes:**
- Notice DC 10: Bodies tucked behind consoles 
    - [brief flavor text for success and failure]
- Program DC 12: Main computer still has partial power
    - [brief flavor text for success and failure]
- Hidden: Creature in ventilation system (Notice DC 14)
    - [brief flavor text for success and failure] 

**NPCs Present:**
[Stats and motivations]



## Structure Elements

### Set Pieces Should Include:
1. **Initial Description** - What players experience on arrival
2. **Key Features** - Important objects, exits, hazards
3. **NPCs** - Who's here and what they want
4. **Challenges** - Skill checks, combat, puzzles
5. **Secrets** - Hidden information or items
6. **Transitions** - How this leads to next scenes

### Keep Descriptions:
- Focused on observable details
- Brief but evocative
- Specific to addressed characters when relevant
- Open-ended for player response
