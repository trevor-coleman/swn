# Mind Meld Facilitation Guide

A guide for running psychic network formation scenes where characters share memories and emotions to create voluntary mental connections.

## Core Concept

When characters form a voluntary psychic network, they must share deep memories and emotions. Each share creates a surreal, cinematic transition that all participants experience together. The GM facilitates these transitions to maintain flow and atmosphere.

## Running the Scene

### Setup
- Players sit in circle formation (in-game and optionally at table)
- Each player prepares 1-2 meaningful memories/emotions to share
- Establish that everyone experiences everything - no observers
- Set expectation of vulnerability and trust

### Mechanics
1. Player describes their character's shared memory/emotion (30-60 seconds)
2. GM creates transitional experience that manifests it for everyone
3. Transition bridges naturally to prompt next player
4. Continue until all have shared at least once
5. Culminate in network formation

## Creating Transitions

### Response Structure (150 words max)

**Step 1: Manifest Their Memory** (50-100 words)
- Transform their share into shared sensory experience
- Everyone is IN it, not watching it
- Use specific sensory details
- Include impossible elements

**Step 2: Create Bleed-Through** (25-50 words)  
- Show how memory warps the space
- Emotions affect physics
- Past bleeds into present
- Boundaries dissolve

**Step 3: Bridge to Next** (25-50 words)
- End with image/sensation that prompts next player
- Create natural but surreal connection
- Open possibility without prescribing

### Example Transitions

**Input**: "Lance shares his memory of watching his squad die when their neural network collapsed"

**Transition**: 
"The chamber fills with the taste of copper and stimulant chemicals. You're all suddenly in Lance's body, feeling the neural jack burn out, watching six minds flatline in your peripheral vision like deleted files. The walls become military gray, then dissolve into static. Adrian, you feel Lance's medic training kick in—useless, too late—and it resonates with something buried in your own past. The static begins forming into shapes from your memories..."

**Input**: "Dallas shares the feeling of being treated like equipment, not a person"

**Transition**:
"The mist turns chrome-cold. Everyone's skin prickles with the sensation of being inventory—tagged, numbered, valued only for function. You taste the metallic tang of the navigation chamber, feel the ports in Dallas's skull like phantom wounds in your own heads. The dehumanization spreads like frost across glass until Kaedim, you recognize this feeling from somewhere else entirely. The frost cracks, revealing..."

## Transitional Elements Toolkit

### Sensory Bridges
- Shared sensation becomes different memory with same feeling
- Color bleeds from one scene into another  
- Sound echoes transform into new environment
- Physical sensation (cold/heat/pressure) carries between memories

### Reality Warping
- Walls become liquid, reform as new space
- Gravity shifts, ceiling becomes floor of next memory
- Time stutters, aging/reversing participants
- Objects transform (weapon → medical tool → childhood toy)

### Emotional Echoes
- "This feeling finds its twin in [character]'s mind"
- "The emotion inverts, becoming its opposite"
- "Your shame recognizes their pride as the same wound"
- "The joy and grief are revealed as one emotion"

## Progressive Intensity

### Early Shares (First 2-3)
- Maintain some distinction between individuals
- Memories clearly "owned" by someone
- Transitions more visual/external
- Establish trust and pattern

### Middle Shares (4-6)
- Boundaries blur significantly
- Can't tell whose memory is whose
- Emotions become physical spaces
- Synesthesia increases

### Deep Shares (7+)
- Complete ego dissolution moments
- Memories layer and combine
- Past/present/future collapse
- Language might break down

## Style Guidelines

### Always Include
- Specific character names
- Impossible colors/sensations ("the color of regret," "the weight of unspoken words")
- Time distortion
- Synesthesia (emotions have color, sounds have texture)
- Physical impossibilities treated as normal

### Never
- Prescribe what players will share next
- Close off possibilities
- Exceed 150 words per transition
- Forget that everyone experiences everything
- Make it feel safe or comfortable

## Emergency Transitions

### If Sharing Becomes Too Heavy
"Gaius's panic cuts through like a record scratch—'IS THAT MY MEMORY OR YOURS? WHY DO I REMEMBER HAVING TWELVE FINGERS?'"

### If Players Need Encouragement
"The network pulses hungrily. It knows you're holding back. The mist turns violet with anticipation, and you feel the others' curiosity like gentle fingers at the edges of your mind..."

### If Technical Interruption
"Reality hiccups. For a moment you're all in the enhancement chamber, alarms screaming. Then the memory space reasserts itself, but now it's tinged with urgency..."

## Culmination

When all have shared, describe the network forming:
- Individual boundaries dissolve but reform stronger
- Shared understanding without loss of self
- New tactical awareness (mechanical benefits)
- Sense of profound connection
- Voluntary nature is key - can disconnect but choose not to

## Mechanical Benefits of Formed Network

- Shared initiative (best roll + 2)
- Tactical communication without speaking
- Emotion bleed (know each other's status)
- Voluntary disconnection possible
- Range: 50m normally, unlimited during resonance events

## Remember

You're creating bridges between player contributions, not driving the scene. Each transition should feel like a natural but surreal consequence of what was just shared, while opening space for the next revelation. The goal is profound connection through voluntary vulnerability.
