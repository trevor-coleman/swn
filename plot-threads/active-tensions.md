# Active Plot Threads & Tensions

## Immediate Threats

### The Silence Architects - UNIVERSE-LEVEL THREAT
- **Status**: CRITICAL - One identified, two unknown
- **Revelation**: The Scream was deliberate genocide
- **Personal Connection**: Party has met one disguised as info broker
- **Current Risk**: Architects alerted to investigation
- **Assets**: Grand Nexus location, master override codes
- **Danger**: May trigger another Scream-level event

### Lance's Neural Condition
- **Status**: CRITICAL - Recovering
- **Context**: Failed disconnect from Resonant Dawn network
- **Risk**: Potential transformation like the Interpreter
- **New Ability**: Network Echo grants Protocol memory access
- **Management**: Must limit use to avoid further damage
- **Advantage**: Can access Architect memories

### Archive Judgment
- **Status**: RESOLVED (off-screen during Lance's journey)
- **Outcome**: Unknown - party fled during sanctuary crisis

### Aurelius Consortium Pursuit
- **Status**: ACTIVE THREAT
- **Context**: Consortium pursuing party after Orinda Mine incident
- **Assets**: Helios Shard and other vessels
- **Interest**: Resonance Protocol artifacts and data
- **Party Status**: Currently at Archive, but will need to evade when leaving

## Major Discoveries

### Navigator-Khyber Connection
- **Revelation**: Dallas and Kaedim show unusual compatibility patterns
- **Historical Context**: Navigators were historically exploited by Khyber lineage
- **Archive Founded**: By escaped navigators opposing Khyber control
- **Question**: Is their meeting coincidence or manipulation?

### Resonance Protocol
- **Artifacts**: Crystal fragment (Kaedim), corrupted key data (Kaedim's gauntlet)
- **Locations**: Site Theta, Grand Nexus (drill-space)
- **Competing Interests**: Aurelius Consortium, ~~Resonant Dawn cult~~ (destroyed)
- **Danger**: Security Chief Keller partially transformed by exposure
- **New Understanding**: Tool used by Architects to trigger the Scream
- **Dallas's Coordinates**: 2847.3/-891.2/-3 (Grand Nexus location)

### Aurelius Jump Gate
- **Status**: Currently dormant after party's arrival
- **Problem**: No return travel possible without intervention
- **Interest**: Multiple factions studying the phenomenon
- **Significance**: Party's arrival method draws unwanted attention

## Faction Conflicts

### Aurelius Consortium vs Resonant Dawn
- **Competition**: Both seeking Resonance Protocol artifacts
- **Consortium**: Commercial exploitation focus
- **Cult**: Religious significance and transcendence
- **Party Position**: Caught between, possessing key artifacts

### Archive vs Outside World
- **Archive Mission**: Preserve knowledge, prevent exploitation
- **Outside Pressure**: Multiple factions want Archive's jumpgate texts
- **Party Access**: Gained significant knowledge about jumpgates
- **Future Risk**: May become targets for this knowledge

## Character-Specific Tensions

### Dallas
- Precognitive abilities make him valuable to multiple factions
- Historical navigator exploitation creates ethical concerns
- Potential dependency issues with Kaedim (per historical patterns)

### Kaedim
- Khyber lineage marks him as historically problematic
- Gauntlet's power creates both opportunity and danger
- Archive judgment determines immediate future

### Lance
- Carries sensitive Nexus data and pretech salvage
- Hacking skills make him both asset and liability
- Altered neurochemistry noted as "unconventional" by Archive
- **NEW**: Network Echo ability allows Protocol memory access
- Risk of transformation if ability overused
- Currently recovering from neural entanglement

### Adrian
- Medical knowledge crucial for understanding biological effects
- Successfully extracted Keller but long-term effects unknown

## Unresolved Questions

1. What is the full nature of the Resonance Protocol?
2. Who or what manipulated Dallas and Kaedim's meeting?
3. Can the Aurelius Jump Gate be reactivated?
4. ~~What are the Resonant Dawn's true capabilities?~~ (Cult destroyed)
5. Which information broker is the Architect?
6. What happened to the lost party member Taka?
7. Why did the Architects trigger the Scream?
8. Are there contingencies if all Architects die?
9. What does the master override actually do?

## Potential Allies

- **Penticton 9**: Grateful for repairs, potential safe harbor
- **Archive**: If judgment passed, powerful knowledge ally
- **Gaius Carranzo**: New recruit, unknown loyalties
- **Orinda Survivors**: 14 grateful individuals with insider knowledge

## Next Steps
- Survive Archive judgment
- Evade Aurelius Consortium
- Decide how to use Resonance Protocol knowledge
- Find safe harbor (37 Labria suggested)
- Investigate jumpgate restoration possibilities
