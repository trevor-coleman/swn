### Files Updated
1. **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Added instructions for player handouts and new party structure
2. **CLAUDE.md** - Updated organization structure to reflect player folders
3. **MASTER-INDEX.md** - Updated character links to point to character-sheet.md files
4. All navigation files properly reference the new structure

### Key Benefits
- Each player has all their information in one place
- Abilities and handouts are with the relevant character
- Clear separation between player and NPC information
- Easy to add new handouts/abilities per player
- Shared resources (ship) remain at party level
