- **Tags**: [{'name': 'Cybercommunists', 'description': 'On this world communism actually works, thanks to pretech computing devices and greater or lesser amounts of psychic precognition. Central planning nodes direct all production and employment on the world. Citizens in good standing have access to ample amounts of material goods for all needs and many wants. Instead of strife over wealth, conflicts erupt over political controls, cultural precepts, or control over the planning nodes. Many cybercommunist worlds show a considerable bias toward the private interests of those who run the planning nodes.', 'enemies': ['Embittered rebel against perceived unfairness', 'Offworlder saboteur', 'Aspiring stalin-figure'], 'friends': ['Idealistic planning node tech', 'Cynical anti-corruption cop', 'Precognitive economist'], 'complications': ['The pretech planning computers are breaking down', 'The planning only works because the locals have been mentally or physically altered', "The planning computers can't handle the increasing population within the system"], 'things': ['Planning node computer', "Wildly destabilizing commodity that can't be factored into plans", 'A tremendous store of valuables made by accident'], 'places': ['Humming factory', 'Apartment block of perfectly equal flats', 'Mass demonstration of unity']}, {'name': 'Tomb World', 'description': 'Tomb worlds are planets that were once inhabited by humans before the Silence. The sudden collapse of the jump gate network and the inability to bring in the massive food supplies required by the planet resulted in starvation, warfare, and death. Most tomb worlds are naturally hostile to human habitation and could not raise sufficient crops to maintain life. The few hydroponic facilities were usually destroyed in the fighting, and all that is left now are ruins, bones, and silence.', 'enemies': ['Demented survivor tribe chieftain', 'Avaricious scavenger', 'Automated defense system', 'Native predator'], 'friends': ['Scavenger fleet captain', 'Archaeologist', 'Salvaging historian', 'Xenophilic native survivor'], 'complications': ['The ruins are full of booby-traps left by the final inhabitants', "The world's atmosphere quickly degrades anything in an opened building", 'A handful of desperate natives survived the silence', 'The structures are unstable and collapsing'], 'things': ['Lost pretech equipment', 'Tech caches', 'Stores of unused munitions', 'Ancient historical data'], 'places': ['Crumbling hive-city', 'City square carpeted in bones', 'Ruined hydroponic facility', "Cannibal tribe's lair", 'Dead orbital jump gate']}]
