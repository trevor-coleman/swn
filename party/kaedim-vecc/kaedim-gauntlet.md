# Kaedim's Khyber Gauntlet

## Creation Process
- Kaedim and Lance dismantled a pretech maintenance bot from their ship
- Combined robot components with crystalline fragment from Orinda
- Required two difficult technical checks (Fix/Telekinesis) to complete
- Second attempt succeeded, creating a psychic resonance device

## Physical Description
A baroque-styled mechanical device with three articulated fingers, housing the crystal in its palm. When active, it emits a visible psychic glow and resonance hum. The design suggests both artistic craftsmanship and alien functionality.

## Capabilities

### Psychic Enhancement
- Roll 3d6 on psychic skill checks (instead of 2d6)
- Functions as psychic battery (maintains 1 effort for up to 1 day)

### Combat Enhancement
- Telekinetic Armory: +1 to hit, damage, and AC
- At TK checks 12+: 
  - Treats armor as AC11 for Shock damage
  - Can ignore up to 15hp damage

### Resonance Properties
- Creates visible psychic glow when active
- Produces resonance hum audible to those nearby
- Appears to resonate with similar pretech in the sector
- Established connection to other resonance points across Abiha Omicron

## The Dark Influence
When Kaedim attunes to the gauntlet, it begins to exert a strange influence on him. His connection to the Khybers of the past awakens a feeling of power inside him that makes those around him seem small and weak and requiring domination.

## Historical Significance
- Contains Resonance Protocol crystal from Orinda
- Represents fusion of Khyber psychic tradition with Protocol technology
- Archive recognized it as significant Khyber artifact
- Currently subject of Archive judgment regarding worthiness

## Dangers
- Psychic resonance can trigger violent reactions (as seen at Archive)
- Influence pushes toward historical Khyber domination patterns
- May strengthen unwanted connection to ancestral memories
- Could be key to controlling or being controlled by Protocol

## Current Status
- Integrated with Kaedim's psychic abilities
- Under evaluation by Archive authorities
- May be confiscated if judgment fails
- Resonating with Archive's ancient systems
