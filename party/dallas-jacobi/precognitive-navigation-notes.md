# Precognitive Navigation Fundamentals

## Archive-Granted Knowledge
*Special technique learned during Archive purification ritual*

### Effect
+1 to Notice, Precognition, and Navigation rolls after meditation

### Historical Context
- Navigators were historically used as "anchors" in the Resonance Protocol
- This technique represents a fragment of that ancient practice
- The Archive preserves this knowledge to prevent its exploitation

### Connection to Kaedim
The Archive detected unusual compatibility patterns between Dallas and Kaedim, suggesting their meeting may not have been coincidence. This pairing echoes historical Navigator-Khyber relationships, though the significance remains unclear.

### Meditation Process
- Requires quiet environment and focus
- Duration: 10-15 minutes
- Effects last until next extended rest
- Can sense Protocol resonances more clearly while active
