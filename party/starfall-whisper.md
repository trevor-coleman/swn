## Background
The Starfall Whisper is a heavily modified Black Arrow-class patrol boat, originally designed for system defense forces but extensively retrofitted for independent operations. Its distinctive dark metallic hull features adaptive camouflage coating that helps mask its sensor signature, while reinforced plating provides extra protection without sacrificing the vessel's impressive speed.

- Advanced nav computer integrated with enhanced sensors for superior tactical awareness
- Automated repair systems can handle minor damage without crew intervention
- Modular cargo space can be quickly reconfigured for different mission profiles
- Extended stores and fuel bunkers allow for extended operations without resupply

- Despite multiple recalibrations, the port side artificial gravity always feels slightly stronger than starboard
