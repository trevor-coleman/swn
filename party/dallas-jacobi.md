## Background
Dallas might have spent his whole life wrangling meatimals and dusting crops on the Jacobi ranch back on Triatis 4 if it wasn't for that little tickle in the back of his mind that let him know when trouble was coming. He knew when a stampede or twister was going to kick up before the breeze even changed direction. Ma and Pa Jacobi realized that their youngest boy had a gift that would open up doors for Dallas if he could only learn to use it right. 

The Jacobis scraped together what savings they had and sent Dallas off to a psychic training academy in the city where he learned to hone his sixth sense. Dallas got a job as a gravcabbie to make ends meet and he found he felt more at home in a vehicle than a classroom. He washed out of psychic academy and took up with an asteroid mining crew as an apprentice. Dallas learned his way around gravflyers and starships, and his trained precognition helped him steer the crew clear of the odd pirate ambush. Eventually, the mining rights in their belt changed hands and Dallas's mining crew was left without a mine. The pay wasn't that great anyway, so Dallas decided to try for a new start on Nova Esperanza. It sounded like the sort of place where a fella with quick reflexes and a nose for trouble could make his fortune.

## Goals
Make his fortune through skill, luck and the sweat of his brow… or ideally just luck.
