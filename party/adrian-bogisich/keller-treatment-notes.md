# Security Chief Keller - Treatment Notes

## Patient Summary
**Name:** Security Chief Keller  
**Condition:** Partial Protocol Integration  
**Status:** Stabilized but not fully reversed

## Initial Presentation
- Found partially merged with crystalline Protocol structure
- Consciousness fragmented between human and network
- Physical form exhibiting mineral growth patterns
- Vital signs erratic but present

## Extraction Procedure
1. **Resonance Disruption**
   - Used localized EM pulses to break crystal bonds
   - Required precise frequency matching
   - Multiple attempts needed for full separation

2. **Physical Extraction**
   - Careful removal of crystalline growths
   - Preservation of vital organ function
   - Significant tissue damage unavoidable

3. **Consciousness Retrieval**
   - Guided meditation to anchor human awareness
   - Suppression of Protocol whispers
   - Establishment of mental barriers

## Current Status
- Physically separated but scarred
- Occasional Protocol "echoes" reported
- Requires daily medication to prevent re-integration
- Mental state: Functional but fragile

## Ongoing Treatment
- Anti-resonance pharmaceutical regimen
- Weekly psychological evaluation
- Physical therapy for crystal damage
- Monitoring for integration recurrence

## Prognosis
- Full recovery unlikely
- Management of symptoms possible
- Risk of relapse if exposed to strong Protocol fields
- Lifespan impact unknown

## Lessons Learned
- Early intervention critical
- Complete prevention better than treatment
- Protocol attraction may be permanent
- Some changes appear irreversible
