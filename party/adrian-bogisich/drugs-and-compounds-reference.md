# Drugs and Compounds

## NeuroStabilin
**Creator:** Adrian Bogisich
**Type:** Neuro-regenerative serum

A potent serum designed to cleanse, stabilize, and repair synaptic pathways. Synthesized to help Lance recover from neural damage.

### Components
1. **PsioCleanse (Base Compound)**
   - Clear, viscous fluid from psionic resonance stabilizers
   - Detoxifies and flushes psychoactive residues
   - Neutralizes lingering compounds without harsh withdrawal

2. **Neurolase Extract**
   - Synthetic enzyme modeled after pre-Scream neural growth catalysts
   - Accelerates damaged neuron regeneration
   - Restores synaptic pathways dulled by overstimulation

3. **Synapse-Coat Nanites**
   - Microscopic programmable particles
   - Bind to synaptic gaps, reinforcing neural signals
   - Reduce noise from damaged receptors
   - Degrade naturally without toxic residue

4. **Cerebralin (Psionic Buffer)**
   - Blue luminescent liquid with psionic energy dampeners
   - Stabilizes neural activity fluctuations
   - Prevents dangerous spikes during detox

5. **Glial-Restore Aminopeptides**
   - From genetic research vials
   - Repair glial cells (brain's support system)
   - Improve cognitive function
   - Reduce neuroinflammation

### Effects
- Instantly clears all drug penalties
- Purges toxins from system
- Restores lost INT points
- Provides clarity (+2) for mental saves

### Side Effects
- **Psionic Feedback:** Roll 1d6. On a 1, experience brief psionic surge causing 1d6 neural overload damage
- **Lucid Nightmares:** Vivid dreams about past missions (may provide clues or disturb)

## ☿ NOETIC VEIL ☿
**Type:** Psychotropic Psionic Blocker
**Form:** Small iridescent capsule with shifting pearlescent liquid

### Effects
- Creates impenetrable mental fog shielding from psionic intrusion
- Mind becomes chaotic landscape of non-linear thoughts and hallucinations
- Duration: 6 hours
- All telepathic attempts fail, returning only nonsense

### Side Effects
- Profound dissociation from reality
- Time dilation (minutes feel like hours or vice versa)
- 1-in-6 chance of epiphany (sudden insight)
- 1-in-6 chance of psychotic loop (fixation on idea/hallucination)

### Overdose Risk
Taking more than one dose in 24 hours can cause:
- Permanent cognitive distortions
- Spontaneous psionic feedback
- Ego fragmentation

### Synthesis from Janitorial Supplies

#### Key Ingredients
1. **Solvent Base**
   - Source: Industrial degreasers, coolant alcohols, medical-grade ethanol
   - Purpose: Carrier for active compounds

2. **Neural Noise Inducer**
   - Source: Ammonia cleaners + ship coolant (ethylene glycol)
   - Purpose: Induces mild neurotoxicity disrupting thought

3. **Psychedelic Agent**
   - Source: Mold/fungal contamination, hydroponic waste, altered food dyes
   - Purpose: Ergot-like alkaloids for psychedelic effects

4. **Neurotransmitter Modulator**
   - Source: Caffeine pills, antihistamines, expired sedatives
   - Purpose: Alters dopamine/serotonin flow for mental scrambling

5. **Encapsulation**
   - Source: Gel capsules or food thickeners (gelatin/alginates)
   - Purpose: Slow release and stomach protection

#### Synthesis Process
1. Extract psychedelic agent from cultivated mold/fungi
2. Mix ammonia cleaner with ship coolant, distill to reduce toxicity
3. Dissolve powdered psychedelic in solvent
4. Add neural noise inducer until iridescent sheen appears
5. Add caffeine/antihistamine to reduce vomiting risk
6. Test in microdoses
7. Encapsulate in gel caps or absorbent strips
8. Single dose lasts 10 hours - do not exceed once daily

## Crackers
**Type:** Stimulant
**Usage:** Inhalation
**Creator:** Adrian Bogisich (synthesized for Lance)
**Origin:** Popular on Weintraub 7 refueling station

An illicit stimulant derived from processed leaves of a hardy local plant, consumed by inhaling crystalline powder.

### Effects (2d4 hours)
- Burst of energy and heightened focus
- Increased stamina
- +1 bonus to Fix, Program, or Work skill check for 1 scene
- Ignore first level of Fatigued condition

### After Effects
- User becomes Fatigued when duration ends
- If used again before Fatigued condition removed: 1d4 damage

### Risks
- Highly addictive (physical and psychological)
- Prolonged use causes:
  - Dependency
  - Jittery nerves
  - Difficulty sleeping
  - Health problems
- Overdose risk: dangerous spikes in heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature

### Addiction
- Repeated use leads to addiction
- Withdrawal effects when drug unavailable
- Can be cured through treatment and counseling
