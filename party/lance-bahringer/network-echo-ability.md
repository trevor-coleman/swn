# Network Echo - Recalling Protocol Memories

## Overview
Lance gained this ability after his neural entanglement with the collapsing Resonant Dawn network. It allows him to access fragments of the Protocol's vast information network through residual connections in his mind.

## Mechanics

### The Skill Check
**Roll**: 2d6 + Int + Program vs DC
- Standard SWN skill check format
- Uses Lance's Program+2 and INT 14 (+1)

### Difficulty Classes
- **DC 8**: Basic Protocol functions, recent cultist knowledge
- **DC 10**: Technical specifications, historical events
- **DC 12**: Deep pre-Scream knowledge, hidden locations
- **DC 14**: Silence Architects intel, command codes

### On Failure: Mental Saving Throw
- **Mental Save**: 15 + Wis modifier
- **Lance's Save**: 15 + 0 = 15 (WIS 10)
- **Failure Result**: Lost in network fragments for 1d6 hours

### Modifiers (SWN Standard)
- **+1**: Related to locations Lance has visited
- **+2**: Information directly relevant to current situation
- **-1**: Each use after the first in 24 hours (mental fatigue)
- **-2**: Attempting to access very alien/ancient memories

### Frequency Limitation
- Once per day under normal circumstances
- Can attempt additional uses with cumulative -1 penalty
- Extended rest (8+ hours) resets the daily limit

## Origin
Gained during the Resonant Dawn Sanctuary incident when Lance failed his disconnect save and became trapped in the collapsing network. The partial neural integration left him with lingering access to Protocol memory fragments.

## Risks
- Mental fatigue from overuse
- Possibility of becoming lost in network fragments
- May attract attention from Protocol-sensitive entities
- Could trigger further transformation if abused

## Strategic Applications
- Research Protocol locations before visiting
- Access technical specifications for pretech
- Uncover historical context for current events
- Potentially find command codes or security bypasses
- Gather intelligence on the Silence Architects

## Connection to Character
This ability represents Lance's dangerous brush with the same transformation that consumed the Interpreter. His "unconventional pathways" noted by the Archive may have prevented complete integration, leaving him with this controlled access instead of total merger.
