## Unique Gift: The Khyber Gauntlet
A large, bulky (slightly Baroque looking) robotic gauntlet with 3 fingers—actually a psionic resonance engine.

**Components:**
- Small psychic resonance crystal
- Pretech components salvaged from pretech maintenance bot

### Abilities:
1. **Roll 3d6 on psychic skill checks**
2. **Psychic Battery:**
   - Maintains 1 Effort for 1 day
   - Once Effort is committed, Kaedim regains that point
   - Meta skill check 8 required to maintain
3. **Psitech Armory Enhancement (costs +1 Effort on TK Armory):**
   - TK Check 10: +1 to hit, +1 damage, +1 AC
   - TK Check 12+: Armor treated as AC 11 for shock; commit +1 Effort to ignore next 15 HP of damage
4. **+1 Mental Saves** to control the Gauntlet (Resonance-based)

**Drawbacks:**
- Skill check failures = 1 System Strain
- Using any of the 3 abilities causes:
