# The Truth About The Scream

## The Official History (False)
For centuries, the Scream has been understood as:
- A mysterious psychic wave that swept the galaxy
- Killed or drove mad every psychic instantly
- Caused by unknown cosmic phenomenon
- Natural disaster that ended the Second Wave of human expansion
- Created the current dark age of isolated worlds

## The Horrific Truth
**The Scream was a deliberate act of genocide.**

### The Perpetrators
- **Three individuals** known as the Silence Architects
- Had deep access to the Resonance Protocol
- Planned the event at the Grand Nexus (drill-space facility)
- Still alive and operating under false identities

### The Method
- Used the Resonance Protocol network
- Triggered cascade effect across all psychic minds
- Timed for maximum devastation
- Left override codes: SIGMA-NULL-CASCADE-SEVEN-SEVEN-ALPHA

### The Scale
- Billions of psychics killed instantly
- Jump gates failed (psychic navigators died)
- Interstellar civilization collapsed overnight
- Countless worlds isolated and dying
- Technology regression across human space

## Why This Matters Now

### They're Still Active
- Operating under cover identities
- One confirmed as information broker in Eradinus Expanse
- Monitoring for discovery of their crime
- May have contingency plans

### They Can Do It Again
- Still have Protocol access
- Override codes exist
- Grand Nexus remains operational
- No one else understands the system well enough to stop them

### The Party Knows
- Lance accessed their memories through Network Echo
- Recognized one Architect's psychic signature
- Have location of Grand Nexus
- Possess partial Protocol keys

## Implications

### Historical
- Every "natural" explanation for the Scream is a lie
- Post-Scream suffering was engineered
- Dark age was intentional
- Every adaptation to psychic loss was planned for

### Current
- Architects may be manipulating current events
- Their goals remain unknown
- They've had centuries to prepare
- Discovery threatens their plans

### Personal
- The party has met one face-to-face
- That Architect knows them personally
- They're now in a race against discovery
- Stakes are civilization-level

## The Question Remains
**Why did they do it?**

No memories Lance accessed reveal motivation, only method. Three people decided to murder billions and destroy galactic civilization. Their reasons remain the darkest mystery of all.
