# Protocol Key Fragments

## Overview
Five critical components of the Resonance Protocol have been identified across the Abiha Omicron sector. These fragments are essential for reconstructing or controlling the full Protocol network.

## Fragment Locations

### 1. Cou - The Shackle System
- **Location**: Planet Cou
- **Form**: Integrated into enforcement/shackle systems
- **Access**: Requires dealing with planetary quarantine systems
- **Danger**: Active security measures

### 2. Islaanreon - Unbraked AI
- **Location**: Planet Islaanreon
- **Form**: Two physical keys
- **Guardian**: Unbraked AI system
- **Challenge**: Negotiating with or defeating rogue AI
- **Note**: Only location with multiple keys

### 3. Site Theta - Complete Nexus
- **Location**: Hrefna system
- **Form**: Complete Protocol nexus
- **Significance**: Original Protocol site from coordinates
- **Status**: Most complete fragment
- **Interest**: Multiple factions converging

### 4. Villa - In Darkness
- **Location**: Planet Villa
- **Form**: Unknown
- **Condition**: "In darkness" - meaning unclear
- **Access**: Potentially underground or without power

### 5. The Interpreter
- **Location**: Teonxe (Resonant Dawn Sanctuary)
- **Form**: Integrated into neural structure
- **Status**: Partially extracted (40% corrupted copy)
- **Current**: Consciousness fragmenting after failed extraction

## Key Pattern Status
- **Gauntlet Storage**: 40% corrupted pattern from Interpreter
- **Viability**: Unknown due to corruption
- **Risk**: May cause transformation if improperly used

## Strategic Importance
- All five fragments needed for complete Protocol control
- Each fragment represents different aspect of network
- Some fragments may be incompatible or dangerous together
- Order of acquisition may matter

## Faction Interest
- **Resonant Dawn**: Knew locations, sought religious transcendence
- **Aurelius Consortium**: Unaware of full significance
- **Archive**: Likely has knowledge but protective stance
- **Stellar Dynamics**: Unknown level of awareness

## The Warning
During extraction attempt, received message: **"The Scream was not an accident"**
- Implies Protocol connected to the Scream
- Suggests intentional activation or sabotage
- Changes understanding of historical catastrophe
