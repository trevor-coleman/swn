# The Khyber Line

## Overview
The Khyber Line refers to a unique lineage of naturally occurring psychics whose abilities developed in isolation within the Khyber Swarm, Kaedim's homeworld. Unlike most psychics, those of the Khyber Line developed a form of psychic heredity - their unique talents pass down through generations, growing stronger and more refined.

## Distinctive Traits
Their most distinctive trait is the capacity for **psychic resonance with the past** - Khyber psychics can occasionally connect with the consciousness of historical figures who shared their psychic wavelength, experiencing their memories as if they were their own. This ability made them crucial to the development of the Resonance Protocol, as they could form the stable psychic anchors needed for the network.

## Historical Significance
- Essential to Resonance Protocol development
- Served as handlers/masters of precog navigators
- Created stable psychic anchors for the network
- Established exploitative relationship with navigators

## The Scream Survival
During the Scream, when psychic abilities became dangerous and unstable, the Khyber Line's unique mental structure allowed many to survive where other psychics perished. Their isolated homeworld became a refuge for those with this genetic trait, explaining Kaedim's connection to these ancient memories despite never being directly involved with the Protocol's creation.

## Modern Implications
- Kaedim carries this lineage
- His gauntlet may be a Khyber artifact
- Archive scholars recognize the lineage patterns
- Creates natural tension with precog navigators like Dallas

## Connection to Current Events
- Kaedim's ancestral memories growing stronger
- Archive concerned about Khyber-Navigator pairing
- Historical exploitation patterns being repeated
- Gauntlet resonance suggests active Khyber technology
