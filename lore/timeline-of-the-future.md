# A Timeline of the Future

A chronological record of humanity's journey to the stars and beyond, from the discovery of spike drives to the present day of 3200.

## Pre-Stellar Era

### Before 2108
- Russo-European War leaves radioactive hot zones
- Earth-bound humanity reaches technological advancement
- Dr. Tiberius Crohn conducts research in Greenland

## The Discovery Era

### 2108
- **The spike drive is discovered** by crank scientist Dr. Tiberius Crohn
- Humanity moves almost overnight from a handful of science stations on the solar system's inner worlds to all-out interstellar exploration
- Numerous Terran governments seek the resources of new worlds
- Crohn makes the "Night Journey" to Alpha Centauri and back in 13 days
- Crohn broadcasts spike drive specifications then disappears forever

### 2110
- Several scout craft are lost while learning the limits of the spike drive
- The dangers of excessive frequency climbing are recorded by survivors

### 2113
- **First habitable extrasolar world discovered** by the scout ship Magellan
- The ship's patrons promptly claim the world for Greater Europe and name it Renaissance

## First Wave of Colonization

### 2120
- **Pranashakti discovered** - the first life-bearing alien world, found by a Pan-Indian scout ship
- The organisms consist solely of plant analogues and some primitive marine life
- A generation of xenobiologists finds work in analyzing it all

### 2130
- **Asteroid mining technology developed**
- Provides vast amounts of raw materials to Earth's orbital shipyards and factories
- Ship prices plunge
- Numerous smaller organizations and states become capable of stellar exploration

### 2150
- **Ruins of an advanced alien species discovered on Typhon**, an otherwise unremarkable gas giant moon
- Archaeologists date the ruins to approximately 40,000 BCE
- Dubbed "the Watchers" for the eye-like circular motifs on the ruins
- Few details are learned about the species

### 2200
- **First Wave of human expansion reaches its peak**
- Most habitable planets within a year's travel time from Earth have been successfully colonized
- Many colonized by small religious or ideological groups
- Terran nations begin to forbid further exploration for fear of being unable to maintain control over their offworld colonies over such distances
- **The Terran Mandate is organized** by Earth's superpowers to ensure Terran control of the colonies continues

## The Psionic Age

### 2240
- **"Metadimensional Extroversion Syndrome" (MES) begins to manifest** in certain fifth-generation spacers
- Occurring most often around puberty
- Abilities include: telepathy, teleportation, precognitive flashes, and other abilities that defy understanding
- The syndrome is inevitably fatal unless the victim avoids all use of their uncanny abilities

### 2260
- Some colony worlds begin to grow restive
- Incidents of skirmishing and piracy on the frontier
- Few disputes are over resources, but ideological and religious conflicts become more common
- The Terran Mandate struggles to deal with the twelve-month message delay between Earth and the farthest colony worlds

### 2275
- **Psychic training methods developed**
- Researchers on several deep-space colonies develop methods for controlling the advance of MES
- Allows victims to use abilities without inflicting permanent brain damage
- Lives lost in this research are never fully numbered
- Terran governments rapidly move to control the research and training under the aegis of the **"Psionic Authority"**

### 2280
- Properly-trained MES carriers, known commonly as **"psychics"** or more casually as "Messes", begin to use their abilities to assist governments and private enterprise
- Numerous fields benefit from psychic assistance
- The Psionic Authority begins to experiment with more focused, industrially-useful psionic disciplines

## The Jump Gate Era

### 2315
- **The Psionic Authority perfects the first jump gate**
- A massive ring of psitech placed at the periphery of the solar system
- Employs a choir of over fifty master teleporters to instantly translate ships to a matching gate at Renaissance
- Gate dispersal slowed by lack of master teleporters
- Transit time between Earth and the frontier reduced to two days
- Earth nations lift the ban on further exploration

### 2330
- **The Second Wave of human colonization begins**
- Spike drive ships become all but unknown within the core worlds
- Jump gates allow cheaper system ships to travel between older colonies

### 2350
- Psitech-enhanced manufactory abilities and precognitive surveyors vastly increase the rate of viable colonization
- **Almost two billion humans leave Earth** for the wealth and freedom of the colony worlds
- The Terran Mandate begins to realize they lack the manpower to maintain control over so many colonies

## Decline of Central Authority

### 2400
- **Obedience to Terran governments becomes a polite fiction** on the frontier
- The first stellar unions begin to form
- Some neighboring worlds resort to war
- Most colonists see no need for fighting with so many unexploited resources

### 2425
- **The Terran Mandate becomes deeply corrupt and hopelessly decadent**
- Directors concern themselves exclusively with their own interests, rivalries, and ideological obsessions
- Only the AI Maestros of Earth act as a check on their actions
- AIs struggle to maintain a basic level of probity among their creators

## The Golden Age

### 2450
- **The Second Wave is at its peak - the Golden Age of Man**
- The Terran Mandate largely gives up on exerting control over frontier colonies
- Concentrates simply on neutralizing threats to the core worlds
- Every description of human civilization and ideology can be found somewhere in human space
- Psitech supplements normal technology to produce enormous abundance

### 2460
- **Human gengineering becomes common** on some worlds
- Advances in longevity and health spread widely
- Attempts to significantly improve human capabilities bring serious drawbacks
- Some zealous cultures accept consequences in pursuit of the "perfect human"

### 2500
- **Jump Gates begin to reach the frontier**
- Major systems are the first to receive them
- Most minor worlds still reliant on spike drive ships
- The furthest reaches of the frontier extend ten years of spike drive travel from Earth
- Population growth levels off and begins to decline

### 2550
- Certain remote sectors embrace both gengineering and advanced AI integration
- Attempts to **recreate humanity** in ways more suitable to local ambitions
- Some transhumans continue to interact with baseline neighbors
- Others are dangerously aggressive in their proselytization

### 2600
- **Spike drive ships are now somewhat antiquated**
- Serve vastly reduced exploratory effort and as militia ships
- Almost all core systems of importance linked with jump gates
- Psitech has permeated even very basic technology
- Large-scale war between worlds is almost unknown

## The Catastrophe

### 2665
- **THE SCREAM** erupts from somewhere within the Veil Nebula
- Faster-than-light psychic emanation propagates across human space in seventeen minutes
- Every psychic either dies or goes hopelessly insane
- **Jump Gate network collapses instantly**
- Spike drive ships in metaspace are annihilated
- **The Silence begins**
- On Earth, the maddened arch-psions known as **the Crazed** annihilate the planet's infrastructure
- Many AI Maestros destroyed
- Highshine nanite recovery system perverted
- Solar system's defense grid activated and made universally hostile
- **Earth vanishes from all records**

## The Silence

### 2700
- **Countless core worlds die** cut off from vital food and technical supplies
- Psitech manufactories are crippled
- Only a handful of spike drive ships can be fabricated before industrial base erodes
- These ships band together for security and become progenitors of **Scavenger Fleets**

### 2705
- Frontier worlds fare better than core planets
- More spike drive ships available
- Worlds without Jump Gates still had autonomous agriculture and industry
- Loss of psychics leaves psitech equipment largely useless
- Many frontier worlds devolve to survival-level subsistence

### 2710
- **Last easily-salvaged remnants of Mandate pretech wear out**
- Most useful tech was designed to be irreplaceable by frontier worlds
- Technology now only found in lost caches and Mandate ruins
- Some worlds use dangerous methods to maintain vital infrastructure

### 2900
- **Attempts made to recover psychic training techniques**
- Complete absence of experienced trainers hampers effort
- Cost in psychic lives enormous
- A few worlds successful in developing crude training programs
- Most societies abandon effort for immediate needs

## The Recovery

### 3050
- **The Silence starts to lift**
- Worlds that survived begin perfecting non-psitech manufacturing
- "Postech" technology developed - inferior but reproducible
- Most sophisticated psychic fabricator talents lost forever

### 3100
- **Spike drive ships begin remapping drill courses**
- Five centuries of neglect rendered pre-Silence rutters useless
- Dimensional layer shifts make old soundings dangerous
- All courses must be rediscovered through trial and error
- Few Scavenger Fleets cooperate in sharing course data

### 3150
- **Stellar unions start to form** around strongest worlds
- Exploration continues in hands of small traders and scouts
- **Warfare erupts** between unions over lost worlds and installations

### 3200
- **THE PRESENT DAY**
- Fragile web of interstellar commerce reformed
- Countless worlds remain locked in darkness
- Bold explorers seek lost worlds and ancient wealth
- New stellar empires vie for control
- The future remains unwritten
