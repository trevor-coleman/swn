# Session: Lance's Psychonaut Journey
**Date**: June 12, 2025 (Current Session)

## Summary
Following the catastrophic Resonant Dawn sanctuary collapse, Lance navigated through digital mindspace while unconscious, uncovering the truth about the Scream. The party discovered that the Scream was deliberately triggered by conspirators called "Silence Architects" - and horrifyingly, they've already met one.

## The Setup
- Party infiltrated Resonant Dawn sanctuary seeking Protocol Key
- Target: Artifact needed to access ancient pretech sites
- Kaedim's gauntlet crucial for the quest

## The Sanctuary Disaster
- Successfully infiltrated cult compound
- Discovered the Interpreter integrated into Protocol network
- Lance interfaced with systems to download key data
- **Catastrophic Result**:
  - Interpreter died
  - Neural feedback killed all connected cultists
  - Lance fell unconscious from neural overload
  - Party fled collapsing sanctuary

## Lance's Five Thresholds

### 1. Sea of Whispers
- The dying thoughts of all the cultists
- Lance navigated through collective death experience

### 2. The Interpreter's Core
- Dying AI consciousness attempted possession
- Lance resisted integration

### 3. The Scream Echo
- **CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: The Scream was deliberately triggered
- Conspirators identified as "Silence Architects"

### 4. The Protocol Maze
- Choice between different evolutionary paths
- Lance faced options for humanity's future

### 5. The Choice of Return
- Decision: Remain human or transcend
- Lance chose to encode humanity itself as "firewall" against Protocol assimilation

## Current Revelations

### Lance's New Ability
- Awakened with Protocol Memory access
- Dangerous connection to network's vast knowledge
- See: [Network Echo ability](../abilities/network-echo.md)

### The Drill-Space Coordinates
- **Dallas's Memory**: 2847.3/-891.2/-3
- Location where Architects planned the Scream
- Marks the **Grand Nexus** - Protocol control facility between dimensions

### Architect Intelligence
Lance accessed Architect memories revealing:
- **Master Override Codes**: SIGMA-NULL-CASCADE-SEVEN-SEVEN-ALPHA
  - Requires living Architect to activate
- Architects will retreat to Nexus if discovered
- They're still alive and monitoring

### The Terrifying Recognition
**CRITICAL**: Lance recognizes one of three Architect psychic signatures
- Matches an information broker from previous sector (Eradinus Expanse)
- Party has had direct contact with this Architect
- This Architect knows Lance personally
- May now be aware of discovery

## Implications
- One of humanity's greatest mass murderers has been operating as information broker
- The party unknowingly dealt with them in recent past
- The Architect isn't a distant historical villain but someone hiding in plain sight
- Personal stakes dramatically increased

## Current Situation
- Party fleeing with critical intelligence
- Security alerts triggered - Architects aware of investigation
- Kaedim's gauntlet contains corrupted but valuable Protocol data
- Must decide next move:
  - Pursue the Nexus
  - Track down the broker-Architect
  - Find allies before confronting conspiracy

## Key Decisions Ahead
1. How to use Lance's dangerous new ability
2. Whether to pursue Grand Nexus immediately
3. How to identify which broker was the Architect
4. Who can be trusted with this knowledge
5. How to prepare for Architect retaliation

## Session Status
**ONGOING** - Party in flight, processing revelations
