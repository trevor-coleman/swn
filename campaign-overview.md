# Campaign Overview - Abiha Omicron Sector

## Campaign Framework

### Core Plot Threads

1. **The Precog Conditioning Legacy**
   - Precogs like Dallas were historically used as "navigational anchors" in the Resonance Protocol
   - The Khyber Line (Kaedim's heritage) were handlers/masters of these precogs
   - This history creates natural tension between Dallas and Kaedim as they discover it
   - The Archive founded by escaped navigators who opposed this exploitation

2. **The Neural Enhancement Program**
   - Military-developed combat drugs derived from precog conditioning compounds
   - Lance's military background connects him to early versions of these drugs
   - Someone is abducting scientists (potential threat to Adrian) to refine these formulas
   - Lance's altered neurochemistry may provide unexpected resistance

3. **The Resonance Protocol Revival**
   - Multiple factions searching for Protocol components throughout sector
   - Site Theta in Aurelius Asteroid Belt serves as entry point
   - Hidden facilities and research bases contain puzzle pieces
   - Party already possesses key artifacts and knowledge
