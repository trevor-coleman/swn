# Stars Without Number Campaign Assistant

## Purpose
This is a living campaign repository for a Stars Without Number RPG campaign set in the Abiha Omicron sector. The repository serves as both a historical record of past sessions and a planning tool for future adventures. Claude helps track the complex interconnected plot threads, NPCs, factions, and mysteries while maintaining consistency across the campaign.

## Organization Structure

### Historical Records (What Has Happened)

- **planning/next-session/** - Immediate upcoming session prep
- **planning/future/** - Planned locations and adventures
- **planning/ideas/** - Floating concepts to use as needed
- **modules/** - Ready-to-run adventure modules

### World Information

## Session Planning Process
See @gm-notes/session-planning-pattern.md for the detailed workflow

## Content Generation Style
See @gm-notes/content-generation-style.md for how to format modules and descriptions

## Current Campaign Status
See @campaign-overview.md for the big picture
See @plot-threads/active-tensions.md for immediate concerns

## Key Principle
Always maintain clear separation between:
- What has already happened (sessions with dates)
- What is about to happen (planning/next-session)
- What could happen (planning/future and planning/ideas)

This prevents confusion about the current state of the campaign and ensures accurate continuity.
