## Basic Mechanics Overview

Even the most capable interstellar adventurer sometimes encounters a situation where the outcome is by no means certain. When an alien assassin thrusts a blade at an unguarded back, or the ship threatens to careen out of control in a gas giant's upper atmosphere, or when the hero has been critically injured and lies bleeding on a cavern floor, how do you tell what's going to happen next? This chapter provides you with certain basic systems you can use to resolve these questions.

### The Three Primary Systems

1. **Skill checks** - Tell you whether or not your hero succeeds at a particular feat of expertise or natural competence. Whenever it's uncertain whether or not your hero can manage a feat, your GM might call for a skill check. Failure at the roll means that your hero either botched it outright, succeeded in a way that was singularly unhelpful, or was foiled by some unexpected outside influence.

2. **Saving throws** - Tell you whether or not your hero evades some immediate peril. If you need to know whether or not the alien insect's poison overwhelms you, or if you can dive away from the grenade before it explodes, or if the villainous psychic's mind-reading powers can pry out your secrets, you make a saving throw.

3. **Combat rounds** - Tell you whether or not your hero has shot, stabbed, exploded, maimed, punched, or otherwise ventilated their foe, and whether the foe has managed to do the same to them. Combat in Stars Without Number is very dangerous, especially to novice adventurers and ordinary NPCs.

### Important Combat Note
One thug with a pistol and a steady hand can kill most newly-minted heroes with a single well-aimed bullet. A first-level Warrior is lethally dangerous to an ordinary street thug, but three or four mooks with street-built slugthrowers are likely to put that budding hero down hard. Don't assume your character is going to survive an experience just because they're a PC.

## Using the Systems

Stars Without Number is built to support a sandbox gaming experience. By default, the systems are meant to be fair, understandable, and flexible enough to be applied to many situations. They're not meant to especially favor the PCs or give them ways to bypass the results of poor decisions or unlucky moments. There is no "narrative currency" the player can spend to avert disaster.

The dice serve as an unbiased third party to your gaming session. This fairness adds surprise and interest to a night's gaming - even the GM isn't completely certain what's going to happen when the PCs forge ahead.

## Scenes and Durations

Many psychic abilities and other powers have durations expressed in scenes. A scene is a shorthand concept for a particular action sequence or exertion on the part of the PCs:
- A single combat encounter is a scene
- The infiltration of a building is a scene
- The ascent of a radioactive mountainside is a scene
- A tense meeting with an alien overlord's cybernetic representative is a scene

Most scenes don't last longer than fifteen minutes or a single contiguous chunk of action. Outside of situations where close time-tracking is important, you can assume that powers limited to scene use can be used about once every fifteen minutes, assuming intervals for rest.

## Saving Throws

### Types of Saving Throws
1. **Physical saves** - Challenges of physical endurance (poisons, diseases, radiation, dire exhaustion)
2. **Evasion saves** - Dodging explosions, evading falling hazards, diving back from crumbling surfaces
3. **Mental saves** - Psychic influences, hallucinations, esoteric mental control technologies

### Saving Throw Mechanics
- Starting score: 15 (decreases by 1 per level)
- Modified by best of two attributes:
  - Physical: Better of Strength or Constitution
  - Evasion: Better of Dexterity or Intelligence
  - Mental: Better of Charisma or Wisdom
- Roll 1d20, equal or beat the score to succeed
- Natural 1 always fails, natural 20 always succeeds

## Skill Checks

### Basic Mechanics
- Roll 2d6 + relevant skill level + attribute modifier
- Equal or beat the difficulty to succeed
- -1 penalty if lacking even level-0 in the skill
- Some technical skills cannot be attempted untrained

### Multiple Applicable Skills
Some checks might suit multiple skills (e.g., javelin-throwing could use Exert, Shoot, or Stab). PC uses the best applicable skill. Peripherally relevant skills increase difficulty by 2.

### Modifiers
- Extremely bad circumstances: up to -2
- Very good situation/perfect tools: up to +2
- Usually no more than Â±2 total

### When To Call for a Check
Only for challenges outside the PC's background and common experience. If failure would make the PC seem incompetent at their role, no check needed. If success/failure doesn't matter to the game, no check needed.

### Aiding a Skill Check
- Helper describes their assistance
- Helper rolls relevant skill vs same difficulty
- Success grants +1 to acting PC
- Multiple helpers still only grant +1 total
- Different skills can help (e.g., Talk helping Sneak)

### Opposed Skill Checks
- All participants roll
- Highest wins (ties go to PC)
- NPCs add their skill bonus if relevant to their role
- NPCs with no relevant expertise roll straight 2d6

## Combat

### Initiative and Rounds
- Combat rounds = 6 seconds
- Initiative: 1d8 + Dexterity modifier
- Act highest to lowest (PCs win ties)

### Actions per Turn
- One Main Action
- One Move
- Multiple On Turn actions (as plausible)
- Instant actions (any time, even off-turn)

### Main Actions
- Attack an enemy
- Disengage from melee
- Use a skill
- Reload a gun
- Produce a Stowed item
- Take second Move action
- Anything else taking ~6 seconds

### Move Actions
- Stand from prone
- Club up a ranged weapon
- Move 10 meters (half if climbing/swimming/rough terrain)
- Can't split movement around Main Action
- Moving from melee without disengaging triggers free attacks

### On Turn Actions
- Fall prone
- Say something
- Drop an object
- Very simple, almost instantaneous actions

### Instant Actions
- Trigger special powers
- Snap Attack (costs Main Action)
- Go totally defensive (costs Main Action)

### Attack Resolution
1. Roll 1d20 + attack bonus + combat skill + attribute modifier
2. Equal or beat target's AC = hit
3. Roll damage + attribute modifier
4. On miss, check Shock damage vs target's AC

### Shock Damage
If weapon's Shock rating can harm target's AC, target takes Shock damage even on a miss. Add attribute modifier and damage bonuses. Weapons never do less than Shock damage.

## Injury and Healing

### Mortal Wounds
- 0 HP from lethal attack = mortally wounded
- 0 HP from non-lethal = unconscious
- Dying victims can't act, die soon without help

### Stabilization
- Int/Heal or Dex/Heal as Main Action
- No tools: Difficulty 10 + rounds since downed
- Medkit: Difficulty 8 + rounds
- Lazarus patch: Difficulty 6 + rounds
- Victim dies after 6 rounds
- Failed checks can be retried

### Recovery
- Stabilized characters gain 1 HP after 10 minutes
- Further damage before recovery = instant death
- Stabilized PCs need 1 week before normal HP recovery
- Non-mortally wounded regain level in HP per night's rest

## Morale
- NPCs roll 2d6 vs morale score
- Equal or less = keep fighting
- Greater = flee/withdraw/surrender
- Check after first casualty and at 50% losses
- PCs never check morale
