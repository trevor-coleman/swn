# Reaction Rolls

The reaction roll helps GMs determine initial NPC attitudes when PCs first encounter them. This tool creates surprising and interesting situations beyond predictable responses.

## The Reaction Roll Table

Roll 2d6 when PCs first meet a creature or NPC:

| 2d6   | Reaction Result |
|-------|-----------------|
| 2     | **Hostile** - reacting as negatively as is plausible |
| 3-5   | **Negative** - unfriendly and unhelpful |
| 6-8   | **Neutral** - reacting predictably or warily |
| 9-11  | **Positive** - potentially cooperative with PCs |
| 12    | **Friendly** - helpful as is plausible to be |

## Using Reaction Rolls

### Context is Key
Results should be interpreted based on the situation:
- **Gangers + Positive Result**: Might decide not to interfere with PCs
- **Bureaucrat + Positive Result**: Willing to help accomplish PC goals
- **Scavengers + Friendly Result**: Might offer aid instead of attacking

### Benefits
- Prevents reflexive hostile assumptions
- Creates novel situations beyond combat
- Prompts GM to consider NPC motivations
- Can reveal hidden tensions or alliances

### Initial vs Final
- Initial reaction is not permanent
- PCs can influence attitudes through:
  - Persuasion and diplomacy
  - Offers of money or favors
  - Threats or intimidation
- Actions taken depend on initial reaction

## When to Roll
- First meeting with any NPC/creature
- When approaching potentially hostile groups
- When circumstances are ambiguous
- To add unpredictability to encounters

## Example Applications

### Low Results (Hostile/Negative)
- Guards more suspicious than usual
- Merchants refuse to deal
- Informants demand higher prices
- Potential allies are skeptical

### High Results (Positive/Friendly)
- Enemies might parley first
- Officials bend rules to help
- Strangers offer warnings
- Rivals show respect

## Design Notes
Reaction rolls help create a living world where not every encounter is predetermined. They encourage players to try diplomacy and creative solutions rather than assuming violence is inevitable.
