# Robots and VIs

Robot prevalence varies by sector based on metadimensional conditions. This reference covers expert system bots, Virtual Intelligences (VIs), and VI player character options.

## Expert Systems vs VIs

### Expert Systems
- Non-sentient, task-specific programming
- Common and reliable to produce
- Limited to programmed parameters
- Cannot truly adapt or learn

### Virtual Intelligences (VIs)
- Possibly self-aware (debated)
- Require specific metadimensional environment
- Can be programmed with behavioral imperatives
- 10x cost of equivalent expert system
- Cannot transfer to new chassis
- Some "clever" VIs can grow and learn

## Expert System Levels

| Level | HD Bonus | Atk Bonus | Skill Bonus | Save Modifier | Cost Multiplier |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Base | Base | Base | Base | Base |
| 2 | +1 | +1 | +1 | -1 | x2 |
| 3 | +2 | +2 | +1 | -1 | x4 |
| 4 | +4 | +4 | +2 | -2 | x8 |

### Confusion Checks
Roll 2d6 + skill bonus when outside programming:
- **Difficulty 7**: Partly within normal parameters
- **Difficulty 9**: Completely uncovered situation
- **Difficulty 11**: Uncovered and clearly dangerous

## Robot Types

| Type | HD | AC | Atk | Dmg | Move | ML | Skills | Saves | Cost |
|------|----|----|-----|-----|------|----|--------|-------|------|
| **Janitor Bot** | 1 | 14 | N/A | N/A | 5m | 8 | +1 | 15+ | 1,000 |
| **Civilian Security Bot** | 1 | 15 | +1 | 1d8 stun | 10m | 12 | +1 | 15+ | 5,000 |
| **Repair Bot** | 1 | 14 | +0 | 1d6 tool | 10m | 8 | +1 | 15+ | 5,000 |
| **Industrial Work Bot** | 2 | 15 | +0 | 1d10 crush | 5m | 8 | +1 | 14+ | 2,000 |
| **Companion Bot** | 1 | 12 | +0 | 1d2 unarmed | 10m | 6 | +1 | 15+ | 2,500 |
| **Soldier Bot** | 2 | 16 | +1 | By weapon | 10m | 10 | +1 | 14+ | 10,000 |
| **Heavy Warbot** | 6 | 18 | +8 x2 | 2d8 plasma | 15m | 10 | +2 | 12+ | 50,000 |

### Bot Descriptions

**Janitor Bots**: Ubiquitous cleaning droids, useless in combat

**Civilian Security Bots**: Guard locations, use stunning attacks

**Repair Bots**: Handle standard maintenance, panic in crises

**Industrial Work Bots**: Heavy lifting and welding, slow but tough

**Companion Bots**: Nannies, pets, and other domestic roles

**Soldier Bots**: Humanoid design for standard equipment use

**Heavy Warbots**: Mobile weapons platforms, can mount Heavy weapons

## Repairs and Maintenance

### Expert System Bots
- Require Fix-0 skill and spare parts
- 15 minutes per repair session
- Heal HP = bot's expert system level per unit
- Destroyed at 0 HP (cannot salvage)

### VI Bots
- More durable than expert systems
- If reduced to 0 HP (not by Heavy weapons):
  - Become "Badly Damaged"
  - Need 24-hour overhaul + spare parts
  - Can be jury-rigged temporarily
  - If 0 HP again while Badly Damaged: Physical save or destroyed

## VI Player Characters

### General VI PC Rules
- Same attributes/HP/classes as humans
- Cannot be Psychics or Partial Psychics
- AC 10 unarmored (like humans)
- No need for food/water/sleep
- Need 1 Type B cell per week
- Immune to vacuum, poison, disease
- Take radiation damage normally
- Can be reprogrammed (1 month, Program-1)

### VI Healing
- Repaired with Fix-0 and spare parts
- Can self-repair
- Each unit heals HP = character level
- Takes 15 minutes per unit

### Built-in Equipment
- Costs 2x normal price
- Takes 1 week to integrate
- Maximum encumbrance = Constitution/2
- Cannot use cyberware

## VI Origin Foci

### Android
**Level 1**: 
- Gain bonus skill (related to function)
- Indistinguishable from human (unless at 0 HP)
- All standard VI traits

### VI Worker Bot
**Level 1**:
- Gain bonus skill (related to function)
- +1 to one work-related attribute modifier (max +2)
- Obviously non-human appearance
- All standard VI traits

### VI Vehicle Bot
**Level 1**:
- Gain Pilot as bonus skill
- Become chosen vehicle (drone/hoverbike/gravcar)
- Gain vehicle's Armor rating
- AC = 10 + Dexterity modifier
- Can be upgraded: +Fix skill to AC (1,000cr/point, max +3xskill)
- Use vehicle HP until own HP exceeds it
- Can pilot surrogate body as Main Action
- Equipped with manipulator arms

## Campaign Considerations

### Economic Impact Options
1. **Minimal**: VIs are rare showpieces
2. **Moderate**: Some job displacement, social tension
3. **Major**: VI rights movements, economic upheaval

### VI Treatment by Sector
- Some grant full rights
- Others treat as property
- Behavioral imperatives debate
- "Clever" VI citizenship varies

### Expert System Impact
- Easier to integrate than VIs
- Fill industrial/menial roles
- Human labor still common
- Good money sink for PCs
