## Creating Beasts

### Design Process
1. Start with needs for the adventure
2. Build statistics for the role
3. Add appearance and special traits
4. Consider behavior patterns

### Using Earth Animals
- Start with familiar referent
- Easier to explain to players
- Predictable behavior patterns
- Then add alien variations

## Styling the Beast

### Basic Animal Features (d10)
1. **Amphibian** - froggish or newtlike
2. **Bird** - winged and feathered
3. **Fish** - scaled and torpedo-bodied
4. **Insect** - beetle-like or fly-winged
5. **Mammal** - hairy and fanged
6. **Reptile** - lizardlike and long-bodied
7. **Spider** - many-legged and fat
8. **Exotic** - made of wholly alien elements
9-10. **Hybrid** - roll twice and mix results

## Swarms

### Creating Swarms
- Take base creature
- Quadruple HD (or 4 HD for 1 HP creatures)
- Attack everyone in contact
- On hit: normal damage
- On miss: minimum damage (unless immune)
- All attacks auto-hit swarm
- Need appropriate weapons (fire vs rats, not bullets vs ants)

## Beast Combat Behavior

### Important Notes
- No inherited fear of humans
- Predators hunt if PCs look like food
- Prey ignore if PCs don't look threatening

### Morale Checks
Beasts check morale:
- First casualty
- First time clearly losing
- **Special**: First time prey harms predator

### Combat Reality
- Predators avoid injury
- Won't fight to death unless cornered/mad
- Sane predators can't afford wounds

## World Building Tips

### Ecosystem Consistency
- Stick to 1-2 basic types per world
- Creates recognizable patterns
- Example: All Scutum creatures have moss-colored armor
- Helps players identify imports

### Alien Variations
- Take basic Earth animal
- Add exotic element
- Example: Mammal with glass "fur" that cuts attackers
- Maintains comprehensibility with alien flair

## Importing Creatures
- Use monsters from other old-school games
- Convert AC and attack bonuses
- Reskin to fit setting
- Minimal mechanical changes needed
