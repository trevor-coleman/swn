## Stat Explanations

### Hit Dice (HD)
- Most NPCs have 1 HD
- More HD = history of violence/danger
- Important ≠ More HD (CEO vs warrior-king)
- Roll 1d8 per HD for hit points

### Armor Class (AC)
- **Primitive**: Ignored by advanced weapons
- **Combat**: Obviously protective gear
- **Powered**: Immune to primitive weapons
- Default: Street armor (not obvious)

### Attack Bonus (Atk)
- Usually equals HD
- Martial NPCs get bonuses
- "x2" means two attacks per Main Action

### Damage (Dmg)
- Depends on weapon carried
- Bonus damage (+1 to +4) for skilled warriors
- Most civilians are unarmed

### Morale (ML)
- Check on 2d6 when facing peril
- Roll ≤ ML to continue fighting
- Roll > ML means retreat/surrender
- Check when:
  - First casualty
  - Clearly losing
  - (Non-martial) Combat starts

### Skills
- Bonus to profession-related checks
- +1 for most NPCs
- +2 for skilled professionals
- +3-4 for exceptional experts
- +5 for sector legends

### Saves
- Single score for all saves
- Usually 15 minus half HD (round down)

## Creating Custom NPCs

### Guidelines
- Don't scale to PC power level
- Match role and location
- Universe doesn't adjust to party
- Expertise should be consistent

### Psychics and Special Abilities
- Don't roll up like PCs
- Assign relevant abilities
- Maximum Effort = HD/3 (round up)
- Give foci/powers as needed

## Design Philosophy
NPCs should reflect their actual capabilities, not provide "balanced" encounters. A novice party facing elite killers should run. Veteran PCs meeting those same killers later might defeat them easily. This consistency creates meaningful player choices and a believable world.
