# Creature Creation Guide

General principles and guidelines for creating NPCs and creatures in Stars Without Number.

## Core Design Philosophy

### Universe Doesn't Scale
- Creatures have objective threat levels
- Don't adjust to match PC power
- Novices should run from elite threats
- Veterans can crush formerly dangerous foes
- Creates meaningful player choices

### Appropriate to Context
- Match creature to location and role
- Explain unusual presences
- NPCs notice nearby dangers
- PCs should hear warnings

### Avoid Unavoidable Combat
- Few situations require violence
- Always provide alternatives:
  - Stealth and evasion
  - Negotiation and bribery
  - Environmental solutions
  - Tactical withdrawal
- Player creativity should be rewarded

## Universal Statistics

All creatures use these core stats:

### Hit Dice (HD)
- Determines durability and combat experience
- Roll 1d8 per HD for hit points
- 1 HD = little combat experience
- 2-3 HD = dangerous combatant
- 4-6 HD = veteran warrior
- 7-10 HD = legendary fighter
- 10+ HD = superhuman/altered

### Armor Class (AC)
- Base defense rating
- Modified by:
  - Armor worn
  - Dexterity (+1 to +2 if notable)
  - Natural defenses
- Special notations:
  - **(primitive)** - ignored by advanced weapons
  - **(combat)** - obviously protective
  - **(powered)** - immune to primitive weapons

### Attack Bonus (Atk)
- To-hit modifier
- Usually equals HD
- Martial types add +1 to +4
- "x2" = two attacks per Main Action

### Damage (Dmg)
- Based on weapon/natural attack
- Skilled warriors add +1 to +4
- "each" = per successful attack

### Movement (Move)
- Distance per Move action
- 10m standard for humans
- 5m for slow/bulky
- 15m for fast
- 20m for very fast

### Morale (ML)
- 2d6 roll vs ML to continue fighting
- Check when:
  - First casualty
  - Clearly losing
  - Facing unusual peril
- Success = continue fighting
- Failure = retreat/surrender
- PCs never check morale

### Skills
- Bonus to relevant professional checks
- +1 = competent
- +2 = skilled professional
- +3 = exceptional expert
- +4 = renowned master
- +5 = sector legend

### Saves
- Single target for all saves
- Standard: 15 minus half HD (round down)
- Applies to Physical, Mental, and Evasion

## Creating NPCs Step-by-Step

### 1. Define Role
- What purpose do they serve?
- What would PCs want from them?
- What conflicts might arise?

### 2. Assign Base Stats
- Use templates as starting point
- Modify for specific needs
- Consider role requirements

### 3. Add Distinguishing Features
- Memorable appearance
- Personality quirks
- Motivations and goals
- Useful knowledge/resources

### 4. Special Abilities (If Needed)
- Psychic powers (Effort = HD/3)
- Cyberware or gene-mods
- Unique equipment
- Don't overcomplicate

## Morale in Detail

### When to Check
**Standard Triggers**:
- First ally killed/incapacitated
- Clearly losing the fight
- Facing overwhelming force
- Leader killed/fled

**Special Triggers**:
- Non-combatants when violence starts
- Beasts when first wounded by "prey"
- Minions when boss defeated

### Morale Results
**Success (â‰¤ ML)**:
- Continue current actions
- May reassess tactics
- Stand ground

**Failure (> ML)**:
- **Untrained**: Panic/flee/surrender
- **Trained**: Fighting withdrawal
- **Fanatics**: May go berserk

### Morale Modifiers
Consider adjusting ML for:
- Strong leadership present
- Defending home/family
- Cornered with no escape
- Under influence (drugs/psionics)

2. **Demeanor**: Friendly, Suspicious, Greedy, Nervous, Arrogant
3. **Want**: Money, Information, Protection, Revenge, Escape
4. **Secret**: Double agent, Hidden wealth, Dark past, Special knowledge

### Combat Threat Assessment
- **Mook** (1 HD): Falls to single hit
- **Regular** (1-2 HD): Standard opponent
- **Elite** (3-4 HD): Dangerous, requires tactics
- **Boss** (5-7 HD): Major threat
- **Legend** (8+ HD): Run or use extreme tactics

## Special Considerations

### Groups and Minions
- Share morale checks
- May break individually
- Leaders affect group ML
- Consider group tactics

### Environmental Factors
- Affect movement and combat
- May require saves
- Can provide advantages
- Should impact both sides

### Equipment Impact
- Better gear = higher AC/damage
- Special equipment adds options
- Consider availability
- Price matches capability

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Don't:
- Scale encounters to party level
- Create unavoidable fights
- Ignore morale rules
- Make every NPC a combat threat
- Forget NPC motivations

### Do:
- Let players find creative solutions
- Make retreat a valid option
- Use reaction rolls
- Give NPCs goals beyond fighting
- Reward clever thinking
