## Quick Reference

### Universal Stats
All creatures use these basic statistics:
- **HD** - Hit Dice (1d8 HP per die)
- **AC** - Armor Class
- **Atk** - Attack bonus
- **Dmg** - Damage
- **Move** - Movement rate
- **ML** - Morale (2d6 roll)
- **Skills** - Skill bonus for relevant checks
- **Saves** - Single saving throw target

### Combat Reminders
- NPCs make Morale checks when:
  - First member killed/disabled
  - First time they're clearly losing
  - (Beasts) First time prey harms them
- Non-martial NPCs check Morale when combat starts
- PCs never make Morale checks

### Design Philosophy
- Universe doesn't scale to PCs
- Appropriate threats for location/role
- Avoid unavoidable combat
- Combat is dangerous for everyone
