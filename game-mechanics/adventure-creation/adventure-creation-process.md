# Adventure Creation Process

A step-by-step method for creating Stars Without Number adventures that work at the table.

## Step 1: Identify Your Needs

### Key Questions
- What did the players say they want to do next session?
- Is this the first adventure of a campaign?
- Do you need backup/filler content?
- What purpose must this adventure serve?

### Player Intentions

#### Clear Intentions
- Pursuing a specific nemesis
- Following up on a previous adventure
- Achieving a stated goal

#### Vague Intentions
Examples:
- "Find a good deal on cargo"
- "Explore alien ruins"
- "Get revenge on the duke"

You have more creative freedom with vague intentions.

### Handling Impossible Goals

When players want something impractical:

1. **If Information is Available**: Point out the impossibility and let them reconsider
2. **Suggest Alternatives**: Turn "impossible" into "very difficult"
3. **Follow Player Suggestions**: If they propose workarounds, use them

### When Players Don't Know It's Impossible

Two approaches:

1. **Anticipate Next Actions**
   - Predict their response to the obstacle
   - Prepare content for their likely next move
   - Example: NPC suggests alternative approach

2. **Prepare Filler Content**
   - Create fun distractions while they replan
   - Can be prepared well in advance
   - Keep several sessions worth ready

## Step 2: Choose Ingredients

### Sources
- Your sector information
- Planet tags and elements
- Previously created NPCs, places, complications
- Elements from prior adventures (callbacks)

### If You Need New Ingredients
Create appropriate:
- Friend
- Enemy  
- Complication
- Thing
- Place

### Customization Tips
- Adjust ingredients to fit current situation
- Use recurring NPCs for continuity
- Include at least one callback to prior events
- Make consequences of PC actions visible

### Coherence Guidelines
- Ingredients should connect logically to the campaign
- Avoid elements that appear from nowhere
- Foreshadowing helps players engage
- Context helps players make intelligent choices

## Step 3: Assemble the Outline

### Core Elements

#### The Problem
- Core of the adventure
- Unstable/untenable situation PCs can affect
- Small/specific enough for PCs to impact
- Examples:
  - PCs want something that's hard to get
  - Competing factions threaten innocents
  - Natural disaster requires response

#### The Person
- Connects PCs to the Problem
- Provides human element
- Can be sympathetic ally or dangerous antagonist
- Serves as information conduit
- Give them:
  - Name
  - One-sentence connection to Problem

#### The Place
- Where the adventure occurs
- Can be focus of action or backdrop
- Should affect how Problem unfolds
- Make it matter to the adventure

### Quick Alternative
Use the [100 Adventure Seeds](adventure-seeds.md) and slot in your ingredients.

## Step 4: Flesh It Out

### Essential Questions

#### What maps do I need?
- Assault locations need tactical maps
- Political meetings might not need maps
- Exploration sites need interesting layouts
- Download and modify existing maps

#### What places need to be interesting?
- Exploration sites need mysteries
- Include:
  - Perilous dangers
  - Satisfying rewards
  - Interactive elements
  - Context-appropriate features

#### What NPCs need detail?
For each important NPC, establish:
- **Hook**: Memorable visual/behavioral detail
- **Motivation**: What they want from life
- **Want**: What they want from the PCs
- **Power**: How they can help/harm PCs
- **Stats**: If combat is likely

#### What are the default outcomes?
- What happens if PCs don't intervene?
- Establish timeline if time-sensitive
- Ensure PCs understand urgency
- Show visible progress toward consequences

#### What are the rewards?
- Experience points
- Credits/valuables
- Equipment/artifacts
- Advancing PC goals
- Avoiding terrible outcomes

#### How will PCs get involved?
- Initial hook details
- Information they'll receive
- Resources available
- Starting situation

## Step 5: Polish It Up

### Mental Walkthrough
Put yourself in your players' shoes:
- How will they likely react?
- What approaches will they favor?
- What will engage or anger them?

### Three Key Checks

#### Is it Logical?
- Fits established world facts
- Deviations have good explanations
- Players trust reasons exist
- Operates on setting logic, not story logic

#### Is it Approachable?
- Clear hook to draw interest
- Obvious first step available
- Players can see how to engage
- Multiple entry points exist

#### Is it Engaging?
- Uses elements players love
- Includes elements players hate (villains)
- Connects to PC interests
- Avoids gratuitous grimdark

### Setting Logic vs Story Logic

**Setting Logic** (SWN Default):
- Things exist where they logically should
- Dangers are genuinely dangerous
- No authorial protection for PCs
- No-win situations are possible
- Not every problem has a solution

**Story Logic** (Alternative):
- Obstacles scaled to party ability
- Solutions always exist
- Genre conventions apply
- Dramatic pacing prioritized

## Creating Filler Adventures

### Three Requirements

1. **Insistent**
   - Must be dealt with NOW
   - Examples: Terrorist attack, theft, friend in danger
   - Grabs PCs and won't let go

2. **Short**
   - One session maximum
   - Just long enough to plan real response
   - Don't overcomplicate

3. **Simple**
   - Minimal connection to main plot
   - General enough to use anywhere
   - Don't burn energy on complexity

### Tips
- Recycle unused content
- Keep several ready in advance
- Save everything PCs haven't seen

## Final Reminders

- Let players guide the narrative
- Don't force single solutions
- Maintain world consistency
- Challenge without unfairness
- Save prep work for reuse
- Constructive looting is essential
