## Quick Start

1. **Identify Your Needs** - What does the adventure need to accomplish?
2. **Choose Ingredients** - Select NPCs, places, and complications from your world
3. **Assemble the Outline** - Create the basic Problem, Person, and Place
4. **Flesh It Out** - Add maps, NPCs, rewards, and specific details
5. **Polish It Up** - Ensure it's logical, approachable, and engaging

## Core Philosophy

Adventures in Stars Without Number are created to be playable content at the table. They should:
- Work with the sandbox nature of the campaign
- Respond to player choices and goals
- Connect to the existing campaign world
- Provide meaningful challenges and rewards
- Allow multiple solutions to problems

## Adventure Types

### Regular Adventures
Created in response to player goals stated at the end of the previous session. These adventures:
- Connect directly to player intentions
- Use established world elements
- Build on previous events
- Can range from simple to complex

### Filler Adventures
Quick content for when players catch you off-guard:
- **Insistent** - Must be dealt with immediately
- **Short** - One session maximum
- **Simple** - Easy to slot in anywhere
- Keep several prepared in advance
- Can be reskinned from unused content

### First Adventures
Introduce the setting and get the party working together:
- Provide clear initial situation
- Give reasons to cooperate
- Introduce key setting elements
- Often result in acquiring a ship

## Key Principles

### Player Agency
- **Follow Player Lead** - If players suggest plausible alternate routes, use them
- **Multiple Solutions** - Never assume only one way to solve problems
- **Meaningful Choices** - Player decisions should have real consequences
- **No Railroad** - Avoid forcing predetermined outcomes

### World Consistency
- **Setting Logic** - Adventures operate on established world logic, not story logic
- **No Guaranteed Success** - PCs have no authorial protection
- **Logical Consequences** - NPCs and world react believably
- **Persistent Effects** - Adventures leave lasting changes

### Practical Design
- **Recycle Content** - Save unused material for later use
- **Steal Shamelessly** - Adapt content from other sources
- **Prep What Matters** - Focus on critical elements first
- **Stay Flexible** - Be ready to improvise

## Essential Elements

Every adventure needs:
1. **A Problem** - An unstable situation PCs can affect
2. **A Person** - Someone to connect PCs to the problem
3. **A Place** - Where the action unfolds

## Using These Tools

The tools in this section can be used individually or in combination:
- Use tables to spark creativity when stuck
- Mix and match elements from different tables
- Customize results to fit your specific campaign
- Don't feel bound by random results - they're inspiration, not law

## Quick Reference: Problem Types

- **Money** - Debt, theft, opportunity, extortion
- **Revenge** - Murder, betrayal, humiliation, loss
- **Power** - Leadership contests, coups, succession
- **Natural Danger** - Disasters, environmental hazards
- **Religion** - Schisms, zealots, corruption, heresy
- **Ideology** - Revolution, terrorism, oppression
- **Ethnicity** - Discrimination, conflict, segregation
- **Resources** - Scarcity, discovery, competition

## Integration with World Creation

Adventures should use elements from world generation:
- **World Tags** - Core conflicts and themes
- **Friends & Enemies** - Pre-generated NPCs
- **Complications** - Existing tensions
- **Places** - Established locations
- **Things** - Important objects

Remember: Save creative energy for where it counts. Everywhere else, plunder without shame.
