# Creating Problems

Every Problem boils down to a fundamental conflict. These tables help generate compelling Problems for your adventures.

## Core Concept

At the bottom of every Problem there's a conflict the PCs can engage:
- A person wants something and can't have it
- They don't want something and are being forced to accept it
- They have something and it's being threatened
- They want something and someone else wants it too

## How to Use These Tables

1. **Roll 1d8, 1d10, 1d10** on the Conflict Type table
2. **First roll (d8)**: General type of conflict
3. **Second roll (d10)**: Overall situation
4. **Third roll (d10)**: Specific focus

You can stop at any point if you have enough inspiration.

## Using Problems in Play

### Single-Sided Problems
Some Problems only have people on one side (e.g., natural disasters). The disaster has no motivations, but the victims struggle to survive.

### PC-Involved Problems
Make the PCs one of the sides when appropriate. If "Money was stolen" and "The PCs are owed it," they have built-in motivation.

### Long-Term Problems
Some Problems with strong Restraints can simmer for extended periods, making excellent filler adventures you can deploy when needed.

### Integration Tips
- Use existing world elements (Friends, Enemies, Complications)
- Insert callbacks to prior adventures
- Make consequences visible and lasting
- Keep Problems scaled to PC influence
