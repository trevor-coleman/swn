# An Example of Adventure Creation

The GM has just started a new campaign, and he needs to brew up an initial adventure to pull the party together and get them accustomed to the sector he's just created. He knows what planet the PCs are going to begin on and he knows he wants them to end up owning a battered free merchant starship by the end of the session, but the rest is still up in the air.

He starts by deciding whether or not to use an adventure seed. While he sees a few that might work, he decides instead to roll up this adventure from scratch.

## The Setting

The world he's created is a planet known to its natives as Delaine, with the world tags "Alien Ruins" and "Xenophobes". The Delainers have numerous unexplored alien ruins on their world, but fear them as potential sources of catastrophe. They hate outsiders because the offworlders are constantly prodding at the ruins and trying to loot them, and care nothing for the disasters they might unleash on the locals.

The GM knows that his first batch of PCs are very unlikely to all be Delainers, so he decides that they were all passengers on a smuggler ship that tried to land on Delaine and loot one of the ruins. The Delainer defense grid spotted the ship and knocked it down, however, and the PCs were among the few survivors. Maybe the PCs were initially part of the smuggler crew, or maybe they were just oblivious passengers. The GM will let each player decide what their PC's role was during character creation.

## Creating the Problem

The first step is to pick a Problem for the PCs to get involved in. On the face of it, the obvious Problem for the PCs is that they're marooned on a hostile world and need to get off before the natives find them and either kill or imprison them.

The GM wants something a little more specific than this, however. He rolls some dice on the Conflict table, and comes up with "Ethnicity" for the Conflict, with "Two groups that hate each other" and "Official ethnic ghettos". Given Delaine's history, the GM decides that any non-native Delainers present when the world shut down its contact with other planets were separated out into remote ethnic reservations, far away from the ruins. These "offworlders" have been here for generations but are despised by the native Delainers.

With that established, the GM decides that the PC's ship was shot down near one of these reservations, and the bitter offworlders are interested in helping people whom the Delainers hate.

## Creating the Key NPC

But who will the initial Person the PCs contact be? The dice paint the picture of an offworlder motivated to redeem themselves from a prior failure, who wants to find proof of a rival NPC's malfeasance, who knows where significant wealth is to be found, and wears a particularly odd style of dress. 

From this, the GM creates "the Captain", a former ruin smuggler whose crew was gunned down while trying to loot an alien ruin. Only he survived, and his guilt is intense. He still wears a nautical captain's hat, and is hiding out among the offworlders. He knows where he's hidden his ship and can guide the PCs to it if they can make the dangerous overland journey.

The GM isn't so certain about the Captain's want, however. While something like that would make a good sideline for a longer adventure, he wants this initial adventuring session to be relatively short and straightforward. He replaces the want with the Captain's desire for the PCs to get him and his young offworlder wife off the planet, bringing them to just about any place that isn't on Delaine. He's willing to give the PCs his ship if they just help him get away.

## Creating the Complication

Why hasn't the Captain snuck off with his young bride yet? To answer that question, the GM turns to the Places section and rolls up a hazard. The result is "Sentient", which means that there's an intelligent enemy between the Captain and the ship. 

The GM mulls over the possibilities for a while, and decides the Captain wasn't the only survivor. His first mate made it out too, and blames the Captain. He's gathered together a small band of offworlder rebels and is seeking to loot ruins and harm Delainers, because he can't operate the ship without the Captain's security codes and he's not sufficiently talented to hack the locks himself.

## Fleshing Out the Details

At this point, the GM looks at the adventure and identifies the bits he needs to flesh out. He needs to detail:
- The Captain
- The first mate
- The offworlder rebels
- The Delainer security chief who will seek to apprehend the PCs if they're not sufficiently stealthy

All of these people will need combat stats. The Captain's wife, the offworlder reservation locals, and other bit NPCs are unlikely to get into a fight, and don't need stats.

The GM decides he doesn't need a map for the offworlder reservation settlement, but he does need a map of the terrain between the settlement and the hidden ship. He downloads a suitable terrain map from the web for that. On the map, he plants a few Wilderness Ongoings from the Places table that the PCs may or may not encounter depending on how they chart their course.

The last detail to flesh out is the first mate's rebel camp, and how the PCs might get at the starship they're guarding. The GM decides that it's not reasonable for the first mate to have accumulated a vast number of minions, but there are too many for the PCs to comfortably engage. The PCs will have to think of some way to distract them, or possibly sic the Delainer security chief on them before they can get to the ship. It's not the GM's job to hand them a solution, so they'll have to puzzle it out on their own.

## Ready to Play

With that done, the starting adventure is ready. The GM might add some more details and fluff, but what he has is a playable start to a campaign.

## Key Takeaways from the Example

1. **Start with what you know**: The GM knew the starting planet and desired end state (PCs with a ship)

2. **Use the random tables**: Even when you have ideas, the tables can add unexpected depth (ethnic conflict, offworlder reservations)

3. **Adapt results to fit**: The GM modified the Captain's want to better suit a one-shot adventure

4. **Create connected NPCs**: The first mate isn't just a random enemy - he has history with the Captain

5. **Don't overplan**: The GM doesn't create a solution for dealing with the rebels - that's for the players to figure out

6. **Focus on what matters**: Combat stats for potential combatants, but not for everyone

7. **Borrow when you can**: Using a downloaded map rather than creating one from scratch
