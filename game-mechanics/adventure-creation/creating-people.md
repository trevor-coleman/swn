# Creating People

Quick generation tables for NPCs to populate your adventures. Not every NPC needs full detail, but these tables help when players focus on unexpected characters.

## Core Elements

Every important NPC needs:

### 1. Motivation
What the Person wants out of life - their major focus and drive. All their deals and actions revolve around this.

### 2. Want
The immediate thing they think will advance their motivation. This is usually what they'll want the PCs to help achieve.

### 3. Power
What they can use to pay off or threaten the PCs. Without power to help or harm, PCs won't care about their wants.

### 4. Hook
A visual or character quirk to help players remember them.

## Optional Elements

### Initial Manner
How the NPC approaches the PCs at first meeting.

### Default Deal Outcome
Whether the NPC will keep their word with the PCs.

## Quick NPC Creation Process

1. **Roll or choose** a Motivation - this drives everything
2. **Roll or choose** a Want - connects to the Problem
3. **Determine** how the Want advances the Motivation
4. **Roll or choose** a Power - why PCs should care
5. **Roll or choose** a Hook - memorable detail
6. **Optionally roll** Initial Manner and Deal Outcome

## Combat Statistics

Remember: Most people are normal humans with:
- 1 hit die
- No special combat prowess
- Basic weapons if any

Being important doesn't mean being tough. A megacorp president might still have 1 HD if they've lived a sheltered life.

## Using NPCs in Play

- Not every NPC needs all elements
- Spare NPCs can be dropped in when needed
- Adjust generated results to fit your needs
- Connect NPCs to existing campaign elements
- Use the Deal Outcome table when unsure about NPC reliability
