# Creating Places

Places can be simple backdrops or complex exploration sites. These tables help generate both types quickly.

## Types of Places

### Simple Backdrops
- Just need name and brief description
- PCs won't spend much time exploring
- Use existing world generation data
- Add background activity from tables below

### Complex Exploration Sites
- Alien ruins, enemy bases, detailed structures
- PCs will carefully interact with them
- Need maps, hazards, and rewards
- Require more detailed preparation

## Quick Place Generation

### Step 1: Base Description
Pull from your world generation data or create fresh.

### Step 2: Add Ongoing Activity
Choose Civilized or Wilderness based on location type.

### Step 3: Add Hazards (if needed)
For exploration sites, roll hazards for danger.

### Step 4: Add Rewards (if appropriate)
What makes the risk worthwhile?

## Creating Exploration Sites

### Key Elements
- **Perilous dangers** - Make exploration risky
- **Satisfying rewards** - Worth the danger
- **Interactive elements** - Things to manipulate
- **Contextual features** - Fits the location's nature

### Quick Method
1. Download suitable maps from the web
2. Reskin with sci-fi elements
3. Apply hazards to specific areas
4. Place rewards appropriately
5. Add interactive elements

### Sources for Content
- Old-school fantasy modules (reskin for sci-fi)
- Real building blueprints
- Generated dungeon maps
- Mix and match from multiple sources

## Tips for Place Creation

### Making Places Matter
- The Place should affect how Problems unfold
- Environmental features create opportunities/obstacles
- Local color makes locations memorable
- Connect Places to the campaign world

### Scaling Hazards
- Small areas: One general hazard
- Large sites: Different hazards per area
- Consider PC capabilities
- Balance risk with reward

### The Principle of Constructive Looting
- Save creative energy for what counts
- Plunder existing content shamelessly
- Reskin rather than recreate
- Mix sources to disguise origins
