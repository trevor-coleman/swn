# Adventure Rewards

Guidelines for appropriately rewarding player characters in Stars Without Number.

## Core Principle

"Too much money" is not a significant problem in Stars Without Number. Unlike many games, large amounts of wealth don't drastically improve personal power. PCs can:
- Hire minions
- Buy starships
- Get cyberware
- Use wealth as influence

But their character sheet remains basically the same.

## Credit Rewards

### Philosophy
- Let PCs acquire logical amounts based on their deeds
- Don't worry about "keeping PCs hungry"
- Significant favors earn significant rewards
- Match rewards to patron's means

### Credit Reward Table

| Reward Type | Amount |
|------------|--------|
| **Poverty Level** | |
| A lot of money to a slum dweller | 50 |
| Slum dweller's maximum funds | 100 |
| **Working Class** | |
| A lot of money to an ordinary worker | 500 |
| Ordinary worker's maximum funds | 1,000 |
| **Upper Class** | |
| A lot of money to an affluent person | 2,500 |
| Affluent person's maximum funds | 5,000 |
| **Elite Level** | |
| A lot of money to a wealthy person | 25,000 |
| Wealthy person's maximum funds | 100,000 |
| **Ultra-Wealthy** | |
| A lot of money to an oligarch | 1 million |
| Oligarch's available liquid funds | 5 million |

### Contract Work Rates

| Job Type | Payment |
|----------|---------|
| Moderately-skilled short contract work | 20/day |
| An illegal but not serious crime job | 500 |
| Serious but non-capital criminal job | 1,000 |
| Kill someone who isn't very important | 5,000 |
| Kill a significant or well-guarded target | 50,000 |
| Kill a major government official | 250,000 |

### Campaign Impact

In a sandbox campaign:
- No storyline to disrupt with wealth
- Campaign becomes about what PCs do with money
- New wealth brings new problems
- Different challenges replace old ones

## Ships and Major Items

### Basic Guideline
Major hardware requires at least one session of adventure to acquire (if you don't have the money to buy it).

### Starship Acquisition
- Most groups want a ship early
- Can be result of introductory adventure
- PCs must plan/find opportunity if can't afford
- Make acquisition the adventure

### General Principle
When PCs want anything major:
- Ship
- Particular ally
- Base of operations
- Special equipment

**Make them adventure for it!**

## Experience Point Awards

### Basic Award
**Standard**: 3 XP per PC per session
- Fast advancement (2nd level after first award)
- For slower advancement: 2 or 1 XP
- All PCs get same basic award

### Award Methods

#### 1. Session-Based System
- Award at end of every session
- Assumes PCs attempted something worthy
- No award for coasting without challenges

#### 2. Personal Goal-Based System
Each PC lists:
- At least one long-term goal
- At least one short-term goal

Rewards:
- Short-term goal achieved: Basic award (3 XP)
- Long-term goal achieved: Triple award (9 XP)

Notes:
- Different PCs advance at different rates
- Can share goals between characters
- GM judges if goals are challenging enough
- Optional: No PC gets goal XP until another achieves a goal

#### 3. Mission-Based System
- Group agrees on mission/goal
- All get XP when mission achieved
- Can change goal each session
- Harder missions might give bonus XP

#### 4. Loot-Based System
**No experience points used!**

Level progression by credits earned:
- **Level 2**: 5,000 credits
- **Level 3**: +10,000 credits (15,000 total)
- **Level 4**: +20,000 credits (35,000 total)
- **Level 5**: +40,000 credits (75,000 total)
- And so on, doubling each level

Rules:
- Only adventuring wealth counts
- Must convert to spendable credits
- Running score resets at each level
- Can't gain multiple levels at once

Effects:
- Strongly incentivizes plundering
- May cause uneven advancement
- Creates laser-focused avarice

#### 5. Spending-Based System
Same as loot-based, but credits only count if spent on:
- Revelry
- Charity
- Supporting NPC causes
- Building power base
- Other world interaction

**NOT** on:
- Personal equipment
- Cyberware
- Vehicles
- Other directly useful items

Effects:
- Varying character levels
- Encourages world engagement
- Creates interesting choices

## Choosing a Method

Consider:
- Desired advancement speed
- Party unity vs individual achievement
- Campaign tone (mercenary vs heroic)
- Player engagement style
- Bookkeeping tolerance

## Reward Balance

### Too Little
- Players feel unrewarded
- Progress seems glacial
- Motivation decreases

### Too Much
- Not game-breaking in SWN
- Creates new adventure types
- Shifts campaign focus
- Opens new opportunities

### Just Right
- Matches effort to reward
- Reflects patron capabilities
- Feels earned, not given
- Advances campaign naturally

## Special Rewards

Beyond credits and XP:
- Favors from powerful NPCs
- Access to restricted areas
- Unique equipment/artifacts
- Information/secrets
- Allies and contacts
- Safe havens
- Transportation
- Legal immunity
- Social status

These can be more valuable than money and create future adventure hooks.
