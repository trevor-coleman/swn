# Ranged Weapons

Ranged weaponry makes up the majority of the lethal implements that litter the galaxy. Whether the primitive bows of a remnant colony on some desolate lost world or the sophisticated energy weapons of a modern interstellar freebooter, the ability to kill people at a comfortable distance is universally prized.

## General Rules

- **Ammunition**: One Type A power cell recharges an energy weapon magazine. Projectile ammo calibers aren't tracked.
- **Range**: Listed as normal/maximum in meters. -2 penalty beyond normal range.
- **Burst Mode (*)**: Fire 3 rounds for +2 to hit and damage
