# Hacking

In the far future, it's inevitable that many advanced civilizations will use computers to control their vehicles, infrastructure, and data stores. It is equally inevitable that some tech-talented hero will try to use that fact to get something they want. While hacking has some significant limitations in what it can accomplish, it can still be a useful tool for the right kind of hero.

## The Digital Environment

### Network Requirements
Most planets with TL4 or better rely on computers for infrastructure and data:
- May or may not have planetary internet
- Individual buildings usually have internal networks
- Without planetary internet, hacker must be physically present
- GM determines what systems are hackable

### Physical Access
Most hacking requires physical interface:
- **Data Line Tap**: Using metatool (1 minute) or cable-siphon (faster)
- **Terminal Access**: Plugging in (Main Action)
- **Wireless**: Rare, usually only local networks
- **Remote**: Possible but usually impractically difficult

## Executing the Hack

### Basic Process
1. Make connection to system
2. Roll Int/Program skill check
3. Apply modifiers for security and circumstances
4. Resolve success or failure

### Time Requirements
- **Prepared Hack**: Main Action (requires 1+ hour preparation)
- **Standard Hack**: 10 minutes
- **Rush Job**: Main Action with +2 difficulty

### Success
- **Data**: Downloaded instantly
- **Control**: Maintained for 1d4 rounds + Program skill
- **Further Attempts**: Become progressively harder

### Failure
Make second skill check at same difficulty:
- **Success**: Avoid alarm and trace
- **Failure**: System alerted, location traced, response incoming

### Progressive Difficulty
Each hack within 24 hours adds +1 difficulty (cumulative)

## Line Shunts

### When Required
Some systems need line shunts before any hack:
- **Professional Systems**: 1 shunt
- **Government/Megacorp**: 2 shunts
- **Black Sites**: 3 shunts

### Benefits
- Hacks last until shunts disturbed
- Control maintained indefinitely
- Must be placed at specific locations

### Finding Locations
Use "Answer a Specific Question" hack (doesn't require shunts)

## Data Protocols

### Familiar Systems
PCs know protocols of their home sector and common systems

### Foreign Systems
Options to learn:
1. **Study Manuals**: 1 month - 1 week/Program level (minimum 1 day)
2. **Find Local Hacker**: Connect check or adventure, 1,000-10,000+ credits
3. **Experiment**: Obtain local hardware and practice

## Hacking Actions

### Difficulty Table

| Action | Base Difficulty | Description |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|

| Complete Database Acquisition | 12 | Copy entire database |
| Suppress a System | 8 | Shut down systems |
| Subvert a System | 10 | Control systems |
| Sabotage a System | 10 | Permanently damage |

### Modifiers

#### Circumstances
| Situation | Modifier |
|-----------|----------|
| Human overseers alarmed | +1 |
| Rushed unplanned hack | +2 |
| Each hack after first (24hr) | +1 |
| Especially sensitive system | +1 |

#### System Types
| System Type | Modifier |
|-------------|----------|
| Ordinary personal | -1 |
| Small business/savvy personal | +0 |
| Minor gov/major corp | +1 |
| Major gov/megacorp | +2 |

## Detailed Actions

### Answer a Specific Question (Difficulty 8)
Get specific information:
- Find person's address
- Locate path in building
- Find security cameras
- Pull criminal records
- Direct database queries

### Get General Information (Difficulty 10)
Comprehensive data dump:
- Full site maps
- All security system data
- Complete personnel files
- Project documentation
- Exhaustive topic search

### Complete Database Acquisition (Difficulty 12)
Copy entire database:
- Requires 1+ hour to download
- Needs line shunt for duration
- Requires data storage or connection
- Examples: Personnel records, police files, technical databases

### Suppress a System (Difficulty 8)
Shut down automated systems:
- Cameras stop recording
- Sensors deactivated
- Doors won't close/open
- Turrets won't fire
- Affects one system type per hack
- Resumes after hack ends

### Subvert a System (Difficulty 10)
Control system operation:
- Upload fake sensor data
- Fire automated defenses
- Open sealed doors
- Requires Main Action each round to control
- System maintains last state if uncontrolled

### Sabotage a System (Difficulty 10)
Permanent damage:
- Physical self-destruct
- Malignant code injection
- Damage permanent until repaired
- Always triggers immediate alerts
- Repair takes several hours

## Hacking Examples

### Infiltration Scenario
1. Answer Question: Find security room location
2. Suppress System: Disable cameras on route
3. Subvert System: Open locked doors
4. Get General Info: Download guard schedules

### Data Theft
1. Place line shunts (if needed)
2. Complete Database Acquisition
3. Suppress System: Disable alarms during download

### Sabotage Mission
1. Answer Question: Find critical systems
2. Sabotage System: Destroy infrastructure
3. Expect immediate response

## Equipment

### Essential Gear
- **Dataslab/Computer**: For hacking attempts
- **Metatool**: Tap data lines
- **Line Shunts**: For secure systems
- **Cable-siphon**: Quick line access
- **Data Storage**: For stolen information

### Optional Equipment
- **Hacker Suite**: Specialized software
- **Signal Booster**: Rare wireless access
- **Encryption Breaker**: Assists with protocols

## GM Considerations

### Limiting Hacking
- Not everything is networked
- Physical security still matters
- Human oversight catches anomalies
- Critical systems may be air-gapped

### Response Teams
Failed hacks can trigger:
- Annoyed IT staff (eventually)
- Security investigation
- Police response
- Special weapons teams (90 seconds)

### Campaign Integration
- Make networks logical
- Reward preparation
- Balance with other skills
- Create hacking adventures
