## Design Principles

### Resource Management
- **Limited Time**: Focus on what you need for next session
- **Limited Energy**: Don't exhaust yourself on details
- **Guided Development**: Let player interest drive which areas to detail

### Content Guidelines
- **Two Tags per World**: Provides clear character without overwhelming complexity
- **Broad Strokes First**: Establish basics before adding details
- **Adventure-Ready**: Every world should offer potential adventures
- **Interconnected**: Worlds should relate to each other meaningfully

### Sustainability Tips
- **Start Small**: Detail only starting world and immediate neighbors
- **Build as Needed**: Add detail when PCs show interest
- **Consistent Quality**: Better to have fewer well-developed worlds than many shallow ones
- **Player-Driven**: Let PC actions determine which content becomes important

## Common Combinations

### Successful Colonies
- Temperate + Breathable + Human-Miscible + Moderate Population + TL4
- Creates stable, self-sufficient world capable of interstellar trade

### Harsh Frontiers
- Variable Climate + Hostile Biosphere + Small Population + TL2-3
- Creates challenging world requiring ingenuity and cooperation

### Failed Worlds
- Extreme Temperature + Corrosive Atmosphere + Failed Colony + Remnant Biosphere
- Creates mystery and exploration opportunities

### Power Centers
- Regional Hegemon + Major Spaceyard + Large Population + TL4+
- Creates political and economic hub for sector

### Mysterious Locations
- Alien Ruins + Ancient technology tags + Out of Contact
- Creates exploration and archaeological adventure sites

## Adventure Integration

### Each World Should Have
- **Clear Identity**: Memorable combination of 2 world tags
- **Adventure Hooks**: Built from tag elements and critical questions
- **Practical Details**: Starport, law enforcement, trade goods
- **Relationships**: Connections to neighboring worlds and factions

### Campaign Arcs
- **Local**: Adventures on single world using its tags and conflicts
- **Regional**: Multi-world stories using trade routes and polities
- **Sector-Wide**: Major threats and opportunities affecting multiple systems
