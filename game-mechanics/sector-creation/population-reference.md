| 3 | Outpost | Few hundred to few thousand inhabitants |
| 4-5 | Small Population | Fewer than a million inhabitants |
| 6-8 | Moderate Population | Several million inhabitants |
| 9-10 | Large Population | Hundreds of millions of inhabitants |
| 11 | Massive Population | Billions of inhabitants |
| 12 | Alien Inhabitants | Non-human civilization |

## Population and Habitability

Planetary populations hinge on world's habitability. Worlds incapable of growing food on planet's surface are unlikely to have more than few hundred thousand inhabitants at best. Truly inimical worlds might be lucky to have tenth as many.

**Rule of Thumb**: A world ought to have some kind of human habitation unless GM has specific purpose in mind. World untouched by human presence can be interesting but lacks distinguishing features without elaboration.

## Population Growth Patterns

Humans breed quickly and will tend to push up against limits of world's capacity to feed and support them.

**Population Control Methods**:
- Contraceptives and birth licensing (sufficient tech)
- Simple Malthusian culling (forced by circumstances)
- Wars and diseases as population checks
- Voluntary reproductive limitation (wealthy, comfortable cultures)

## Detailed Population Types

### Failed Colonies

Occasionally found dotting worlds of human space. Some date back to First Wave of human colonization more than thousand years ago, while others are more recent efforts that guttered out under strains of colony's birth.

**Causes of Failure**:
- Pirate attacks wiping out young colony
- Hostile biosphere
- Alien attack
- Internal dissension
- Disease outbreaks
- Failure of vital colonial equipment
- Any one of hundred other disasters

**Remnant Value**:
- Ruins might still have valuable pretech artifacts
- Colonization deeds authorized by neighboring worlds
- Few survivors might have clung to life in intervening centuries
- Maintaining some sort of society in wreckage of ancestors' work

### Outposts

Rarely composed of more than few hundred or few thousand colonists at most. Either very new colonies that haven't had time to grow or uncolonized worlds that happen to have naval or corporate base on surface.

#### Corporate or Military Outposts
**Characteristics**:
- Not intended to be completely self-sufficient
- Large outposts often forced to raise own food supplies
- Replacement personnel, spare parts, and advanced tech must be brought in from elsewhere
- Find themselves in sudden distress when vital supply ship fails to make drop
- When some local threat proves more than staff can handle

#### Colonial Outposts
**Characteristics**:
- Tend to be better equipped but with less outside backing
- Natives expect to live and die on world
- More inclined to build permanent structures and local improvements
- Many are exiles, malcontents, or others incapable of tolerating world that sent them forth
- Can make for somewhat explosive mix in young colony
- Tend to be very friendly towards visiting starships
- Often dependent upon free traders and tramp merchants for vital supplies or news

#### Survivor Outposts
**Characteristics**:
- Really just stubborn, persistent survivors of long-failed colonization attempt
- Cultures can survive for centuries
- Perpetually culled by dangers of world until survivors are little more than one more ragged element of local ecology

### Small Population (Fewer than a Million)

Often found on newly-colonized worlds or those with limited arable land. This class has widest range of results, from societies barely large enough to avoid inbreeding to minor worlds of several hundred thousand locals struggling against hostile local conditions.

**Settlement Patterns**:
- Settlements tend to be clustered close to one another for mutual support
- Efficient exploitation of land
- Atmosphere like village-dotted countryside
- Too few people to support large, specialized cities
- Major settlement usually built around spaceport

**Politics**:
- Politics tend to be very personal in nature
- Individual leaders can sometimes address entire population at single meeting
- Networks of family, friends, and employees can dominate local social life
- Small population combined with limited outside contact can result in unusual societies
- More strongly influenced by leader's personal quirks than more populous planet might be
- Some such worlds can grow decidedly unhealthy in their customs and traditions

**Industrial Capacity**:
- Hundred thousand inhabitants normally smallest population that can create spike drive-equipped starships
- Less populous worlds rarely have broad range of specialists and workers necessary to build such ships
- Even at this threshold, maintaining any kind of astronautic industry would require determined focus of entire society
- Only at populations of million-plus inhabitants is there enough industrial margin for less determined construction

### Moderate Population (Several Million)

Found on some of more populous frontier worlds, those planets with excellent climate and soil for agriculture. These worlds teem with human life compared to most of their neighbors.

**Political Development**:
- If they have sufficient technological expertise to build spike drives, probably among significant powers of sector
- Sheer amount of labor and expertise they can put into projects dwarfs capabilities of less populated worlds
- Some worlds fail to coalesce under unified planetary government
- Turn most attention to intra-planetary quarrels between different nations or city-states

**Regional Variations**:
- At hundred thousand citizens or more, city-states and hub settlements start to form
- Some major political divisions might exist beneath overall planetary government
- Regional variations start to become present as towns and smaller settlements assert their own cultural traits
- Young colonies rarely have much framework for resolving these new tensions
- Not uncommon for outsiders to end up as catspaws for varying factions

**Warfare Risk**:
- Full-scale planetary wars have been known to break out
- Some being reduced to burnt-out cinders by maltech weapon or nuclear attacks against regions stripped of their nuke snuffers

### Large Population (Hundreds of Millions)

Significant frontier worlds with excellent agricultural conditions. Massive labor pools and expertise reserves.

**Power Dynamics**:
- Usually among most powerful worlds in sector if technologically advanced
- Can build hundreds or thousands of starships
- Transport weight and personnel available to colonize or conquer less powerful neighbors
- Most prefer safer route of docile client states rather than outright conquest

**Internal Conflicts**:
- Not all such worlds have necessary resources to build starships even with cheap, abundant labor
- These worlds tend to become balkanized, conflict-torn planets not unlike mid-20th-century Earth
- Resource wars are common
- Local politics revolve around byzantine feuds and ancient slights
- Technology tends to be very uneven
- Limited or nonexistent in fields depending on unavailable resources
- Natives often show remarkable sophistication in making most of what they have available

### Massive Population (Billions)

Freak occurrence in most sectors, dependent on almost perfect planetary conditions, First Wave date of colonization, very large initial colonial expedition, and strong cultural imperative for reproduction.

**Requirements**:
- Colonized for almost thousand years
- Likely gone through substantial cultural development and change since founding

**Two Main Varieties**:

#### Regional Hegemon
- More common variety
- Leveraging enormous reserves of labor and scientific personnel
- Build hundreds or thousands of starships
- May have transport weight and personnel to colonize or conquer neighbors outright
- Most prefer safer route of docile client states

#### Balkanized World
- Not all such worlds have necessary resources to build starships
- Become balkanized, conflict-torn planets
- Resource wars common
- Byzantine feuds and ancient slights
- Very uneven technology

### Alien Civilizations

Even rarer than massively human-populated planets. On these worlds, any human presence is either nonexistent or simply token contingent of traders and diplomats. Actual number of aliens may range from few tens of thousands to teeming worlds of billions.

**Vulnerability**:
- Alien civilizations appear no more immune to conflict, disaster, and decadence than humans
- Most alien worlds are isolated planets
- Some sectors were dominated by alien empires before Scream
- Most inhabited worlds found by colonial surveyors consisted of indigenous, low-tech sapients who evolved on world
- Or else were decaying remnants of former empire that had fallen apart into isolated colonial worlds

**Galactic Cycles**:
- Fate of growth, expansion, colonization, and collapse appears very common in galaxy
- Countless alien ruins and lost deep-space artifacts indicate cycles of growth and decay have been going on for millennia
- Little way to tell how many alien empires have swept over what is now human space before dwindling to rotting worlds and then empty ruins

## Population Growth Dynamics

### Equilibrium States

Most worlds have reached equilibrium state with their current populations. While there may be some variation, few worlds are likely to increase much without drastic change in local conditions.

#### Primitive Worlds
- Limit reached in brutally Malthusian fashion
- Locals simply cannot support substantial increase of their numbers
- Additional population restricted by:
  - Widespread contraceptive use
  - Selective infanticide
  - Regular bouts of mass starvation
- Only way out is through advanced technology that can overcome local resource limitations
- Such worlds might explode in population over scant few decades after technological advancement

#### Advanced Worlds
- Limit tends to be organic to culture
- With sophisticated technology supplying abundant entertainment and sustenance
- Less importance in having offspring to labor for family or nourish aged members
- Individuals become more interested in own pleasures and ambitions than burdensome work of child-rearing
- Population tends to slope downward until cultural mores reinforce certain basic minimum of reproduction
- Drastic change in cultural attitudes or increase in societal uncertainty can alter this rapidly

## Population and World Capabilities

### Industrial Capacity
- **100,000+**: Minimum for spike drive construction (with total societal focus)
- **1,000,000+**: Industrial margin for regular starship construction
- **Several million**: Regional power capabilities
- **Hundreds of millions**: Potential sector hegemon
- **Billions**: Definite major power (if resources available)

### Political Complexity
- **Under 100,000**: Personal politics, family networks dominant
- **100,000+**: City-states and regional divisions emerge
- **Millions**: Complex factional politics, potential for civil conflict
- **Hundreds of millions**: Risk of balkanization, resource wars
- **Billions**: Either unified hegemon or chaotic conflict zones

### Technological Advancement
- **Small populations**: Limited specialization, hard to maintain advanced tech
- **Moderate populations**: Can support some advanced industries
- **Large populations**: Broad technological base possible
- **Massive populations**: Can achieve excellence in multiple fields simultaneously

### Contact with Outsiders
- **Failed colonies**: May be unknown to sector
- **Outposts**: Eager for contact, dependent on trade
- **Small populations**: Limited contact, personal approach to outsiders
- **Moderate populations**: Regular contact, established protocols
- **Large populations**: May have extensive trade networks
- **Massive populations**: May dominate local space politically and economically
