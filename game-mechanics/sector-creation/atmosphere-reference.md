## Detailed Atmosphere Types

### Corrosive Atmospheres

Dangerously hostile to conventional vacc suits and protective gear. They steadily strip away at suit vent ports, wiring connections, and weak spots until they break through and flood the suit with toxic cocktail that usually kills in seconds.

**Degradation Time**:
- Weak atmospheres: Up to a day to degrade vacc suit
- Strong atmospheres: As little as an hour

**Native Adaptations**:
- Ablative layers or sprays that can be regularly renewed
- Buildings with steadily-extruded neutralizing materials
- Constant renewal through building surface pores
- Gives buildings drippy, half-melted appearance

**Technology Effects**:
- Even tech level 5 equipment may be affected
- Pretech is often taxed by relentless rigors
- Vehicles and shuttles kept in pressurized garages
- Starships never land for long

**Adventure Applications**:
- Every outdoor activity has built-in time limit
- Whatever party chooses to do outside buildings must be accomplished before suit seals fail
- Atmosphere corrodes holes in vehicle hulls
- Adds tension to otherwise simple tasks

### Inert Gas Atmospheres

Not hostile or poisonous, but unbreathable by humans. If planet's climate is otherwise tolerable, natives might be able to live and work outdoors with only air tank and face mask.

**Requirements**:
- Some degree of technical sophistication necessary for human survival
- Large supplies of oxygen must be extracted from local sources
- "Air mines" might exist to replace oxygen lost during human use
- Local power plants might need to run full blast to crack water molecules

**Social Control**:
- Control of air supply makes rebellion much harder
- Without equipment and power to generate air, rebels are at mercy of those who control oxygen
- Most rulers quickly recognize this fact
- Some worlds make it crime to own illicit oxygen generation equipment

### Airless or Thin Atmospheres

Appropriate to asteroids, rocky planetoids, or barren worlds that have had their atmospheres burnt off by weapons or cosmic caprice. Whatever atmosphere exists is too thin to support human life.

**Characteristics**:
- World largely naked to chill of space and blaze of stellar heat
- Exposure to surface without vacc suit or pressurized building is lethal as hard vacuum
- Hostile to human life but excellent at preserving relics of the past

**Preservation Properties**:
- Provided ruins are kept out of baking heat and meteorite impact
- Remains can survive for millions of years
- Exceptionally ancient alien ruins might date back from before world lost atmosphere

### Breathable Mix Atmospheres

Can support human life without additional equipment or gengineered modification. Any world with human population in millions or more almost certainly has breathable mix atmosphere.

**Characteristics**:
- Every world has its own subtle cocktail of inert gases and atmospheric contaminants
- "New world stink" can be maddening for spacers accustomed to filtered ship air
- Few spacers linger long enough to get used to local air smell
- Attempting to explain discomfort to locals rarely results in positive results
- Some spaceport bars make point of their air filtration and composition mixers

### Thick Atmospheres

Can usually be breathed with aid of filter mask, though mix of contaminants renders it slowly or quickly toxic to humans who attempt to breathe it straight.

**Requirements**:
- Separate air supplies not necessary
- Society must have sufficient technological expertise to manufacture and maintain large numbers of filter masks

**Visibility Issues**:
- Often at least semi-opaque
- Some worlds have completely impenetrable thick atmospheres
- Deep banks of permanent fog might shroud planet
- Natives might need sophisticated ultraviolet or infrared viewing equipment
- Some gas banks might be impenetrable to even these viewing tools
- Can leave party vulnerable to moments of complete blindness

### Invasive Toxic Atmospheres

Composed of substantial proportion of molecules small enough to infiltrate past seals of most vacc suits. Infiltration doesn't harm suit, but molecules must be steadily flushed by system's purification sensors before they build up to debilitating level.

**Effects**:
- Causes much faster bleed of air as breathable oxygen is jettisoned
- Most invasive atmospheres cut oxygen supply durations by half, at best
- Makes oxygen even more important resource than on inert gas worlds

**Dangers**:
- Outdoor work avoided whenever possible
- Any failure of suit's toxin sensors or flush system can lead to death before wearer realizes something is wrong
- Steady exposure to low levels of toxins can result in unfortunate effects even with fully-functional suit
- Hallucinations, chronic sickness, or worse can follow

### Corrosive and Invasive Atmospheres

Exist at very border of what human society can tolerate. Combine all worst traits of eroding, corrosive atmosphere and invasive intrusion of toxic molecules. Far more hostile than any mere airless rock.

**Technology Requirements**:
- Advanced pretech filtering and oxygen generation equipment might maintain tolerable habitats
- Hydroponic systems must be uncontaminated by exterior atmosphere
- Anything less than this tech level means greater amounts of societal resources devoted simply to breathing

**Social Impact**:
- Entire civilizations can be oriented around overcoming difficulties of maintaining structures and pressurized homes
- Whatever provoked initial inhabitants to settle must have been of overwhelming value or necessity
- Highly unlikely that enough ship traffic exists to get any but most fortunate locals offworld
- Rest are obliged to deal with harsh existence as best they can

## Campaign Considerations

### Atmosphere and Population

If GM intends planet to have large human population, they should avoid truly noxious atmospheres. Think carefully about what made humans choose to live on such a world:

**Possible Motivations**:
- Original colonists were prisoners exiled to open-world prison
- Ancestors sought isolation at all costs
- Vital refueling and trading port for multiple spike drive courses
- Original colonists had to make emergency landing

It takes powerful motivation to make colonists decide to make corrosive, burning hellhole their permanent home.

### Atmosphere and Adventure

Hostile atmospheres create natural tension and resource management challenges:
- Time limits on outdoor activities
- Equipment degradation mechanics
- Social control through air supply
- Preservation of ancient ruins
- Environmental storytelling opportunities
