# Sector Creation Overview

## The Nature of Sectors

In the former days of the Mandate, human space was generally divided into administrative sectors, each one the particular responsibility of some fragment of the ancient Terran bureaucracy. Sectors were established based on metadimensional proximity rather than simple spatial distance - individual stars in a sector might be spread out over dozens of light years, but the metadimensional currents between them were strong enough to allow quick travel.

Most sectors had limited contact with other regions of space, with large patches of unfriendly metadimensional space strictly limiting available paths. Some sectors were entirely inaccessible except by top-grade Mandate spike drives.

## Sectors In Your Game

### Campaign Perspective
Sectors limit the scope of material you need to account for in your game. A single sector of 21-30 worlds is more than enough for most parties to explore. Sectors provide convenient explanations for running dramatically different campaigns - space-operatic regions with easy spaceflight versus harder sci-fi sectors without psionics.

### Adventure Context
A sector provides the basic background for adventures the PCs encounter. Every world needs adventure-worthy content to justify the GM's creativity and focus. This is especially important for sandbox games where GMs need playable content ready for each session.

## Core Principles

### Guiding Questions
When building anything for your campaign, ask yourself:
- **Am I having fun?** - If yes, keep building
- **Am I going to need this for the next session?** - If yes, finish it

If you're not having fun and don't need it for the next session, stop. You'll exhaust yourself on minutiae and lack energy for what you actually need.

### Content Creation Guidelines
- You do not have to create everything
- Don't answer every question about the sector
- Don't make every world adventure-ready initially
- Save detail work for worlds that matter most to immediate needs
- Focus on broad strokes and rough colors first

### Isolation Assumption
When building a sector, assume it's isolated from neighboring regions. There might be a few border connections and remembered spike drive paths, but focus on a single sector at a time.

## Creative Resource Management

Every GM has limited time, energy, and creative inspiration. If you try to fabricate a complete sector in one go with interesting planets, meaningful intrigue, and adventure hooks everywhere, you'll exhaust yourself before playing.

Instead, follow this simple principle: **We follow this hobby because it's fun.** If you're enjoying the process, indulge yourself. If something is needed for the next session, finish it. Otherwise, stop and focus on what matters.

## Planning for Success

The most enthusiastic world-builder still has limited creative energy. The following pages will show you how to:
- Maximize return on your effort
- Get the most playable content from the least work
- Ensure you have material ready for your next session
- Create sustainable campaign content

Remember: Being proactive with necessary preparations demonstrates attentiveness, but exhausting yourself on decorative elements helps no one.
