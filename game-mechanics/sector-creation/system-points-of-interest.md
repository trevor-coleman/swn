# System Points of Interest

Additional content for solar systems beyond the primary inhabited world.

## Overview

The world you're creating is the most interesting or important place in this solar system, but it may not be the only one. You can decorate the system with other points of interest worth PC attention. You might do this at the same time you roll up the system's primary world, or wait until it becomes significant point in play.

## Adding Other Worlds

For simplicity's sake, it's often best to stick with one inhabited world. The original colonists would have chosen the most human-habitable planet in the system, and unless they grew dramatically before the Scream they wouldn't have had reason to colonize less favorable planets. Other rocks might be floating in the system, but they're probably barren and uninhabited.

### Questions for Additional Worlds

If you do decide to add additional inhabited planets, generate them normally, but ask yourself these special questions:

1. **What is the origin of the world, and how does it relate to the primary world?**
   - Knowing where this secondary planet's inhabitants came from can give you answers to a host of other questions

2. **How do they feel about the primary world?**
   - If you generate three or more worlds, decide how each feels about the others
   - This feeling may not necessarily be reciprocal

3. **What's the major point of contact between them and the primary world?**
   - If two are friendly, this contact might benefit them both
   - If hostile, it could be something they're fighting over or struggling to maintain dominance in
   - If facing mutual threat, might be something both are facing with united front
   - Or could be struggling to see who gets thrown to wolves first

### Secondary World Relationship Tables

| d8 | Origin of the World | Current Relationship | Contact Point |
|----|---------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| 1 | Recent colony from the primary world | Confirmed hatred of each other | Trade in vital goods |
| 2 | Refuge for exiles from primary | Active cold war between them | Shared religion |
| 3 | Founded ages ago by a different group | Old grudges or resentments | Mutual language |
| 4 | Founded long before the primary world | Cultural disgust and avoidance | Entertainment content |
| 5 | Lost ancient colony of the primary | Polite interchange and trade | Shared research |
| 6 | Colony recently torn free of the primary | Cultural admiration for primary | Threat to both of them |
| 7 | Long-standing cooperative colony world | Long-standing friendship | Shared elite families |
| 8 | Recent interstellar colony from elsewhere | Unflinching mutual loyalty | Exploiting shared resource |

## Other Points of Interest

Aside from other inhabited planets, a system can contain settlements or stations that could draw PC attention. Most of the time these stations can simply be assumed - a TL4 world will have asteroid mines and refueling stations and listening posts, and most have no importance to the game until PCs go looking for them.

### Types of Remote Installations

Most points are intended to be remote outposts of the primary world:
- Deep-space research stations
- Refueling stations on edge of system
- Bases on isolated gas-giant moons with valuable resources
- Other far-flung tendrils of greater civilization

### Independent Establishments

Some of these points could be more independent establishments:
- Deep-space existence can be made largely self-sustaining with TL4 engineering
- Life there is likely primitive and tenuous
- With enough cobbled-together defenses and lack of anything particularly worth stealing
- Exile groups, recluses, and other antisocial sorts can make themselves private domain
- Local planet doesn't care enough about to commit resources required to destroy it

### Pirate Bases

Others become outposts for pirates and other reavers:
- Usually operating under some deniable cover
- Protected by enough defensive installations to dissuade anything short of major military assault
- Simple calculus: effort planetary navy would have to make to get rid of them must be more than cost of tolerating their depredations

**Lifespan**: Few of these anarchic outposts last very long. The stronger and more active they become, the more pressing it is for their victims to take steps to disperse them. Barring some pirate king both charismatic and foolhardy, most such outposts are primed for quick abandonment when fleet shows up on sensors.

## Using System Points

### Adventure Hooks
These points can serve as:
- Destinations for specific missions
- Sources of information or supplies
- Refuges when fleeing pursuit
- Sites of mysterious events
- Competition for resources

### Campaign Integration
- **Early Campaign**: Simple refueling stops or supply runs
- **Mid Campaign**: Complex political situations and moral dilemmas
- **Late Campaign**: Major strategic resources or hidden threats

### Scaling Challenges
- **Outpost-level**: Personal conflicts, equipment failures
- **Base-level**: Political intrigue, resource competition
- **Station-level**: Major threats, system-wide implications

## Development Guidelines

### When to Detail
- Only detail points you'll need for next few sessions
- Focus on locations PCs are likely to visit
- Save full development for places that become important

### Connection to Primary World
Consider how each point relates to main world:
- **Friendly**: Trade partner, research collaboration, mutual defense
- **Neutral**: Independent operation, minimal contact
- **Hostile**: Rival, rebel base, pirate haven
- **Secret**: Hidden from primary world's knowledge

### Sustainability
Ask practical questions:
- How do they get supplies?
- What's their primary purpose?
- Who would want to control or destroy them?
- What makes them worth visiting?

Remember: These are meant to add flavor and adventure opportunities, not overwhelm the campaign with unnecessary complexity.
