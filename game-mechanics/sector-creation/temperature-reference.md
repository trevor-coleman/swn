# Temperature Reference

Climate conditions for world generation and their effects on habitability and adventure.

## Temperature Table

| 2d6 | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| 2 | Frozen | Locked in perpetual ice |
| 3 | Cold | Dominated by glaciers and tundra |
| 4-5 | Variable Cold | Cold with temperate places |
| 6-8 | Temperate | Earthlike in its ranges |
| 9-10 | Variable Warm | Warm with temperate places |
| 11 | Warm | Tropical and hotter in places |
| 12 | Burning | Intolerably hot on its surface |

## Atmosphere and Temperature Interaction

A world's average temperature depends largely on its atmosphere. Worlds with airless or thin atmosphere are directly exposed to wild temperature variations from stellar radiation and the cold void of space. They might flip regularly between unendurable heat and near-absolute zero depending on planetary rotation and orbit.

### Population Considerations

If GM intends planet to have large human population, they should restrict possibility of frozen or burning worlds. Anything intolerable to humans without vacc suits means major agriculture is unlikely. Since it's effectively impossible to feed entire planets through limited interstellar trade, every planet needs to support its own population. Worlds that can't grow food outside hydroponic labs or underground farms are unlikely to support millions of people.

## Detailed Climate Types

### Frozen Worlds

Worlds with so weak a stellar primary or so great a distance that average temperature is close to absolute zero. Any atmosphere that once existed has long since frozen into drifts of solidified oxygen or lakes of liquid helium.

**Hazards**:
- Exposure to frozen drifts is very dangerous
- Vacc suits maintain tolerable temperature easily in void due to lack of conduction
- Dunking suit into thermally-conductive superchilled liquid can force heating elements into sudden overload
- Power cell can drain in minutes or even seconds

**Preservation Properties**:
- Frozen worlds excel at preserving ruins and remains
- Ancient bases and laboratories might be planted deep within frozen wastes
- Lost sites might be remembered in legend and story
- Some native leaders might possess automatic defense bypass codes handed down by ancestors

### Cold Worlds

Uncomfortable, but humans can survive in nothing more than heavy clothing. Worst cold worlds are similar to Earth's Antarctic regions - barren wastes of ice and wind. More clement ones have brief warmer seasons or equatorial bands that get enough solar radiation to support substantial agriculture.

**Agricultural Challenges**:
- Agricultural land is at premium
- Population unlikely to limit numbers to what hydroponic farms can provide
- May lack technology for wide-scale artificial production methods
- Savage wars may have broken out over control of fertile growing regions
- Populations perhaps driven away from arable land into cold zones and lingering death

**Historical Sites**:
- Some worlds retain installations from before Silence deep within frozen wastes
- Ancient bases and laboratories planted when launch sites and orbital windows meant more than temperature comfort
- Lost sites might be remembered in legend and story
- Native leaders might possess automatic defense bypass codes

### Variable Cold Temperature Worlds

Show greater distribution of climates than other worlds, ranging from cold to temperate levels. May be climate that changes world-wide when long, slow orbit brings planet into proximity with stellar primary, or might be world with substantially different climatic zones spread across surface.

**Geographic Variations**:
- North pole might be sun-blasted desert that moderates to cool, wet equator
- Icy world might be warmed by complex channels of geothermally-heated subsurface rivers
- Different zones require different survival strategies

**Weather Patterns**:
- Variable temperature worlds tend to have savage weather
- Mixing of hot and cold air sends ferocious cyclones and raging hurricanes across surface
- Some storms large enough to consume most of hemisphere

### Temperate Worlds

Were most popular colony sites, and most truly populous worlds of frontier have temperate climate. Most have temperature ranges not unlike Earth, though most are canted a little further toward cold or heat depending on angle and proximity to local star.

**Life and Society**:
- Most likely to teem with native life
- Often have alien ruins or remains located somewhere on surface
- Most frontier worlds never accumulated enough population to strain temperate world's arable land
- Capaciousness often allows for more complicated social divisions to develop
- Natives of other worlds often forced to cooperate or die
- Those of clement temperate world have luxury of deep and lasting divisions

### Variable Warm Temperature Worlds

Range from temperate to hot levels. Similar weather and geographic variation issues as Variable Cold worlds, but with heat instead of cold as the extreme.

**Climate Patterns**:
- World-wide seasonal changes bringing planet close to stellar primary
- Substantially different climatic zones across surface
- Savage weather from mixing hot and cold air masses

### Warm Worlds

Come in two main flavors depending on prevalence of water:

#### Desert Worlds
- Hot enough or arid enough to be deprived of most surface water
- Any life must be capable of extracting water from living prey, air currents, or deep underground moisture supplies
- Humans can survive without more than appropriate clothing
- Must learn sophisticated water prospecting and well-drilling techniques to maintain agricultural systems
- Warfare often revolves around water systems

#### Abundant Water Worlds
- Blessed with abundance of surface water
- Tend to be covered with plant and animal life
- Teeming with thick jungles and vast mats of sargasso on seas
- Seas boil with piscids and other alien life analogs
- Can be quite prosperous for humans if native life is edible
- Inhabitants often forced to deal with large predators and vigorously ingenious native ecology of disease

### Burning Worlds

Too hot for humans to survive without equipment similar to vacc suit in effectiveness. Rivulets of molten lead or copper might bleed from open veins on hillsides. Many same perils that face explorer on frozen world have hotter equivalents.

**Hazards**:
- Ash drifts, pools of molten metal, superheated liquid vents can bring quick death
- Miners who inhabit such worlds must be forever vigilant against perils of burning home
- Any habitat without active climate control will be melted or torched in short order

## Climate and Adventure

### Sealed Habitats

Any planet with Burning or Frozen conditions will need some kind of sealed habitat for humanity. If PCs have landed on such world's spaceport, it's probably sealed in subterranean hangar-cavern or domed over by massive civil engineering.

### Temperature as Threat

#### Burning Worlds
- Easiest use is as threat to locals or PCs
- If something isn't fixed, destroyed, or evacuated in time, things will get intolerably hot
- Usually grace period of increasing temperature to add urgency
- Can layer on potential penalties or dangers as PCs struggle to cope

#### Frozen Worlds
- Equally lethal if flood of liquid oxygen threatens to sweep through habitat
- Cold-brittled vital components can break down
- Better at preserving ruins and remains than burning worlds
- PCs might be forced to deal with frigid temperatures searching through alien structure or icy halls of dead habitat
- Conditions can lead to strict time limits on expeditions before materials start to brittle and fail

### Habitable Zones

Worlds of Cold or Warm temperatures are at least habitable outside their most extreme zones, though icy planets might not have much arable land on outside. As consequence, planets with Frozen or Burning temperatures tend to have climate as backdrop rather than something PCs regularly need to deal with.

### Ruins and Exploration

#### Burning Worlds
- Not going to happen very often - any habitat without climate control will be destroyed
- No ruins to explore or remnants to recover unless somehow fireproof

#### Frozen Worlds
- Much better for preserving ruins and remains
- PCs might search through alien structure or icy halls of dead habitat
- Strict time limits before materials start to brittle and fail under relentless chill

### Agricultural Limitations

Temperature directly affects:
- Available arable land
- Agricultural methods required
- Population carrying capacity
- Social tensions over resources
- Technology requirements for survival

Extreme temperatures force societies to:
- Develop specialized survival techniques
- Create enclosed agricultural systems
- Compete fiercely for limited habitable zones
- Invest heavily in climate control technology
