Biological conditions for world generation and their effects on colonization and survival.

## Biosphere Table

| 3 | Microbial | Only microscopic life forms exist |
| 4-5 | No Native Biosphere | Life never evolved on this world |
| 6-8 | Human-Miscible | Some native life is nutritionally compatible |

| 12 | Engineered Biosphere | Extensively altered by advanced civilization |

## Biosphere Likelihood

Some worlds are highly unlikely to have a biosphere:
- Airless rock
- Frozen wasteland  
- World of boiling tin

These are unlikely to host life more sophisticated than microbes, though the universe has demonstrated existence of exotic creatures even on seemingly unendurable planets.

## The Edibility Question

The real question of a biosphere is whether or not it's edible. Colonists on worlds without edible local life are forced to seed and grow Terran crops, which may be outcompeted by native life specifically evolved for this world. Colonists might end up starving amid gardens of alien fruit, unable to digest any of it.

**Benefit**: Humans are just as poisonous to local life, though many large predators don't realize this until after they devour some luckless colonist.

## Detailed Biosphere Types

### Biosphere Remnants

The wreckage of a ruined ecology. Petrified trees, drifts of preserved bones, forests of dead plant life - something killed all life on this planet in relatively recent past.

**Possible Causes**:
- Exercise of maltech planet-buster weapon
- Mutant microbe introduced by human colonists
- Volcanic eruption or asteroid impact that plunged world into decades of frozen night

**Archaeological Value**:
- Any local civilization not sophisticated enough to escape planet likely died when it did
- Ruins and remains might be found throughout desolate wastes
- More clues as to cause of devastation may be discovered

### Microbial Life

Often the only thing that exists on more inhospitable planets, yet wide variety of environments that can accommodate life means these little beasts show up in most unlikely places.

**Extreme Adaptations**:
- Some varieties of slime mold have evolved on corrosive-atmosphere planets
- Form mucous-like outer shell against atmosphere
- Feed and grow off chemical byproducts of erosion

**Dangers**:
- Microbial life can be dangerous
- Most alien microbes unable to infect or harm radically different biology of humans
- Some show enough ingenuity to accomplish even that difficult feat
- Rumors of terrible "space plagues" that leave behind only drifting ships and garbled warnings

### No Native Biosphere

Occasionally found on even most temperate and otherwise habitable worlds. For one reason or another, life simply never evolved on these worlds, leaving them blank slate for agricultural and ecological efforts of humans.

**Advantages**:
- If world is otherwise amenable to Terran life, such planets can be enormously fertile and agriculturally rich

**Potential Disasters**:
- Pretech xenobiologists compiled standardized colonization packages of plants, animals, and insect life
- Not all colonists implemented these packages correctly
- Some worlds had disasters or special circumstances that destabilized efforts
- Some empty worlds now in constant biological flux as local ecology strives to find equilibrium
- Can be suddenly and drastically destabilized by import of some offworld plant or animal
- With no strong native ecology to fight off interlopers, wrong beast or bug can lay waste to whole continents
- These planets tend to be extremely paranoid about importation of foreign life forms

### Human-Miscible Biosphere

Some substantial portion of native life is biologically compatible with human nutritional needs. Local plants and animals may not be tasty or terribly nourishing, but they can support life without serious importation of Terran crop seeds and livestock.

**Supplementation**:
- Even friendlier human-miscible biospheres often lack wide variety of edibles that evolved on Earth
- Natives often supplement stocks of local foods with limited Terran agriculture
- Exotic foods, spices, and liquors can be worth interstellar importation to feed hunger for novelty possessed by elites

**Dangers**:
- Fact that humans can eat some native life means very likely that some native life can eat humans
- Large predators and diseases capable of human infection are by no means uncommon
- Small colonies can be hard-pressed to survive them

### Immiscible Biosphere

Not friendly to humans. None of local plants or animals are edible, and anything colony needs to eat will have to be grown from Terran stock.

**Allergenic Problems**:
- Common for pollen and other microbial life to be highly allergenic to humans
- Requires regular use of tailored antiallergenics to prevent eventual respiratory failure or exotic immune-system reactions

**Gengineering Temptation**:
- Worlds exceptionally susceptible to temptation of human gengineering
- Despite persistent drawbacks, genetic flaws, and handicaps that human gengineering usually introduces
- Desperate need to eat can drive worlds to wholesale experimentation on their progeny
- Resultant altered humans often able to digest local food
- Commonly pay for it in shortened life spans, physical disabilities, or inability to consume Terran foodstuffs
- Sometimes consequences are worse still

**Exotic Life**:
- Produce some of most exotic plants and animals in human space
- Unfettered by limits of familiar evolutionary patterns
- Creatures of bizarre beauty and strange configurations
- Many lack intelligence to realize humans are as poisonous to them as they are to humans

### Hybrid Biosphere

Stable intermixing of Terran flora and fauna with local life forms. Most such worlds have been colonized for centuries before Silence, giving local ecology time to shake out into relatively stable configuration of Earth-born organisms and native life.

**Compatibility**:
- Native biology may or may not be miscible with human life
- Unlikely to be particularly hostile in any case, or else interloping life forms would not have been able to get foothold on planet

**Adaptations**:
- Often show strange examples of symbiosis and adaptation
- Plants and animals forming new alliances
- Large predators from one world may subsist on herds of herbivorous alien life
- Terran vegetation provides sustenance for large populations of small, furred, insect-like grazers
- Familiar animals may show seemingly bizarre behavior patterns formed in response to local conditions
- May become larger or more aggressive
- May have been gengineered for compatibility

### Engineered Biosphere

Among the rarest, as they require enormous time and effort on part of highly advanced civilization. Whatever life exists on this planet has been extensively altered by alien race or by advanced pretech gengineering methods.

**Types**:
- **Paradise Planets**: Carefully sculpted by fabulously wealthy predecessor to suit their tastes
- **Living Forges**: Where foodstuffs and refined minerals are produced as byproducts from basic organic processes of world's biosphere

**Fragility**:
- Such worlds tend to be fragile
- Many engineered worlds dependent upon regular stabilizing work to prevent genetic drift and adaptations that do not serve creator's purpose
- Without regular pruning and adjustment, engineered biospheres can go badly awry

**Failure Modes**:
- Some end up leaving nothing but genetic wreckage in their wake
- Others go wrong in more subtle ways
- Where once biosphere existed to serve inhabitants, creaking engineered biosphere can leave planet's population chained to constant repair and maintenance efforts
- Just to prevent planetary collapse

## Biosphere and Colonial Success

### Agricultural Implications

**Edible Native Life**:
- Allows for sustainable large populations
- Reduces dependence on Terran imports
- May provide unique export opportunities

**Inedible Native Life**:
- Forces reliance on Terran agriculture
- Limits population carrying capacity
- May require extensive terraforming efforts

### Disease and Compatibility

**Human-Miscible**:
- If humans can eat native life, native diseases may affect humans
- Large predators may view humans as food
- Symbiotic opportunities possible

**Immiscible**:
- Allergenic reactions common
- May force human modification through gengineering
- Creates clear biological barriers between humans and native life

### Technological Requirements

**Complex Biospheres**:
- May require advanced filtration systems
- Need for tailored medical treatments
- Gengineering facilities for human adaptation

**Simple/Absent Biospheres**:
- Require extensive agricultural infrastructure
- Need for environmental controls
- Terraforming equipment for long-term habitability
