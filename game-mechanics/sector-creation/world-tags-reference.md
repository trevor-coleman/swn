# World Tags Reference

Complete listing of all 100 world tags with associated adventure elements.

## Using World Tags

Tags are brief conceptual tropes that distinguish worlds from others of similar population and characteristics. Generally use two tags per world - one can feel flat, three or more can muddy the feel.

### Tag Elements
Each tag includes:
- **Enemies (E)**: Potential antagonists
- **Friends (F)**: Helpful contacts  
- **Complications (C)**: Obstacles and challenges
- **Things (T)**: Important objects or devices
- **Places (P)**: Significant locations

### Combining Elements
Mix elements from both tags to create world-specific content. Example: "Regional Hegemon" + "Psionics Fear" could create Heinrich Stalt, Imperial Mind Proctor - a grim inquisitor purging worlds of psychic "monsters."

### 45. Mandarinate

The planet is ruled by intellectual elite chosen via ostensibly neutral examinations or tests. Values this system selects for may not have anything to do with actual practical leadership skills, and examinations may be more or less corruptible.

**E**: Corrupt test administrator, Incompetent but highly-rated graduate, Ruthless leader of clan of high-testing relations
**F**: Crusader for test reform, Talented but poorly-connected graduate, Genius who tests badly
**C**: Test is totally unrelated to necessary governing skills, Test was pertinent in past but tech/culture has changed, Test is for skill vital to maintaining society but irrelevant to governance, Test is sham and passage based on wealth/influence

**P**: Massive structure full of test-taking cubicles, School filled with desperate students, Ornate government building decorated with scholarly quotes and images

### 46. Mandate Base

The Terran Mandate retained control over this world much longer than usual, and world may still consider itself true inheritor of Mandate legitimacy. Most of these worlds have or had superior technology, but may labor under burden of ancient restrictive tech or monitoring systems designed to prevent rebellion.

**E**: Deranged Mandate monitoring AI, Aspiring sector ruler, Demagogue preaching local superiority over "traitorous rebel worlds"
**F**: Idealistic do-gooder local, Missionary for advanced Mandate tech, Outsider seeking lost data from Mandate records

**P**: Faded Mandate offices still in use, Vault containing ancient pretech, Carefully-maintained monument to Mandate glory

### 47. Maneaters

Locals are cannibals, either out of necessity or cultural preference. Some worlds may actually eat human flesh, while others simply require rendering humans into important chemicals or pharmaceutical compounds, perhaps to prolong lives of ghoul overlords. This cannibalism plays major role in their society.

**E**: Ruthless ghoul leader, Chieftain of ravenous tribe, Sophisticated degenerate preaching splendid authenticity of cannibalism

**P**: Hideous human abattoir, Extremely civilized restaurant, Funeral-home-cum-kitchen

### 48. Megacorps

The world is dominated by classic cyberpunk-esque megacorporations, each one far more important than vestigial national remnants that encompass them. These megacorps are locked in cold war, trading and dealing even as they try to strike in deniable ways. Over-council of corporations usually acts to bring excessively overt ones into line.

**E**: Megalomaniacal executive, Underling looking to use PCs as catspaws, Ruthless mercenary who wants what PCs have

### 50. Minimal Contact

Locals refuse most contact with offworlders. Only small, quarantined treaty port is provided for offworld trade, and ships can expect exhaustive search for contraband. Local governments may be trying to keep very existence of interstellar trade secret from populations, or may simply consider offworlders too dangerous or repugnant to be allowed among population.

**E**: Customs official, Xenophobic natives, Existing merchant who doesn't like competition
**F**: Aspiring tourist, Anthropological researcher, Offworld thief, Religious missionary
**C**: Locals carry disease harmless to them and lethal to outsiders, Locals hide dark purposes from offworlders, Locals have something desperately needed but won't bring it to treaty port
**T**: Contraband trade goods, Security perimeter codes, Black market local products
**P**: Treaty port bar, Black market zone, Secret smuggler landing site

### 51. Misandry/Misogyny

The culture on this world holds particular gender in contempt. Members of that gender are not permitted positions of formal power and may be restricted in movements and activities. Some worlds may go so far as to scorn both traditional genders, using gengineering techniques to hybridize or alter conventional human biology.

**E**: Cultural fundamentalist, Cultural missionary to outworlders, Local rebel driven to pointless and meaningless violence
**F**: Oppressed native, Research scientist, Offworld emancipationist, Local reformer
**C**: Oppressed gender is restive against customs, Oppressed gender largely supports customs, Customs relate to some physical quality of world, Oppressed gender has had maltech gengineering done to "tame" them
**T**: Aerosol reversion formula for undoing gengineered docility, Hidden history of world, Pretech gengineering equipment
**P**: Shrine to virtues of favored gender, Security center for controlling oppressed, Gengineering lab

### 52. Night World

The world is plunged into eternal darkness. The only life on this planet derives energy from other sources, such as geothermal heat, extremely volatile chemical reactions in planet's soil, or light in non-visible spectrum. Most flora and fauna is voraciously eager to consume other life.

**E**: Monstrous thing from the night, Offworlder finding obscurity of world convenient for dark purposes, Mad scientist experimenting with local life

**P**: Formlessly pitch-black wilderness, Sea without a sun, Location defined by sounds or smells

### 53. Nomads

Most natives of this world are nomadic, usually following traditional cycle of movement through lands they possess. Promises of rich plunder or local environmental perils can force these groups to strike out against neighbors. Other groups are forced to move constantly due to unpredictable dangers that crop up on planet.

**E**: Desperate tribal leader who needs what PCs have, Ruthless raider chieftain, Leader seeking to weld nomads into army
**F**: Free-spirited young nomad, Dreamer imagining stable life, Offworlder enamored of the life

**P**: Temporary nomad camp, Oasis or resource reserve, Trackless waste that kills the unprepared

### 54. Oceanic World

The world is entirely or almost entirely covered with liquid water. Habitations might be floating cities, or might cling precariously to few rocky atolls jutting up from waves, or are planted as bubbles on promontories deep beneath stormy surface. Survival depends on aquaculture. Planets with inedible alien life rely on gengineered Terran sea crops.

**E**: Pirate raider, Violent "salvager" gang, Tentacled sea monster
**F**: Daredevil fisherman, Sea hermit, Sapient native life
**C**: Liquid flux confuses grav engines too badly for them to function on this world, Sea is corrosive or toxic, Seas are wracked by regular storms

### 55. Out of Contact

Natives have been entirely out of contact with greater galaxy for centuries or longer. Perhaps original colonists were seeking to hide from rest of universe, or Silence destroyed any means of communication. May have been so long that human origins on other worlds have regressed into topic for legends. Players might be on first offworld ship to land since First Wave of colonization a thousand years ago.

**E**: Fearful local ruler, Zealous native cleric, Sinister power that has kept world isolated

### 56. Outpost World

The world is only tiny outpost of human habitation planted by offworld corporation or government. Perhaps staff is there to serve as refueling and repair stop for passing ships, or to oversee automated mining and refinery complex. They might be there to study ancient ruins, or simply serve as listening and monitoring post for traffic through system. Outpost is likely well-equipped with defenses against casual piracy.

**E**: Space-mad outpost staffer, Outpost commander who wants it to stay undiscovered, Undercover saboteur
**F**: Lonely staffer, Fixated researcher, Overtaxed maintenance chief

### 57. Perimeter Agency

Before the Silence, the Perimeter was Terran-sponsored organization charged with rooting out use of maltech, technology banned in human space as too dangerous for use or experimentation. Unbraked AIs, gengineered slave species, nanotech replicators, weapons of planetary destruction... the Perimeter hunted down experimenters with great indifference to planetary laws. Most Perimeter Agencies collapsed during Silence, but few managed to hold on to mission, though modern Perimeter agents often find more work as conventional spies.

**E**: Renegade Agency Director, Maltech researcher, Paranoid intelligence chief
**F**: Agent needing help, Support staffer, "Unjustly" targeted researcher

### 58. Pilgrimage Site

The world is noted for important spiritual or historical location, and might be sector headquarters for widespread religion or political movement. Site attracts wealthy pilgrims from throughout nearby space, and those with money necessary to manage interstellar travel can be quite generous to site and its keepers. Locals tend to be fiercely protective of place and its reputation, and some places may forbid entrance of those not suitably pious or devout.

**E**: Saboteur devoted to rival belief, Bitter reformer who resents current leadership, Swindler conning pilgrims
**F**: Protector of holy site, Naive offworlder pilgrim, Outsider wanting to learn sanctum's inner secrets

### 59. Pleasure World

This world provides delights either rare or impermissible elsewhere. Matchless local beauty, stunningly gengineered natives, wide variety of local drugs, carnal pleasures unacceptable on other worlds, or some other rare delight is readily available here. Most worlds are fully aware of value of their offerings, and prices they demand can be in credits or less tangible recompense.

**E**: Purveyor of evil delights, Local seeking to control others with addictions, Offworlder exploiter of native resources
**F**: Tourist who's in too deep, Native seeking more meaningful life elsewhere, Offworld entertainer looking for training here

**P**: Breathtaking natural feature, Artful but decadent salon, Grimy den of desperate vice

### 60. Police State

The world is totalitarian police state. Any sign of disloyalty to planet's rulers is punished severely, and suspicion riddles society. Some worlds might operate by Soviet-style informers and indoctrination, while more technically sophisticated worlds might rely on omnipresent cameras or braked AI "guardian angels". Outworlders are apt to be treated as necessary evil at best, and "disappeared" if they become troublesome.

**E**: Secret police chief, Scapegoating official, Treacherous native informer
**F**: Rebel leader, Offworld agitator, Imprisoned victim, Crime boss

**P**: Military parade, Gulag, Gray concrete housing block, Surveillance center

### 61. Post-Scarcity

Locals have maintained sufficient Mandate-era tech to be effectively post-scarcity in their economic structure. Everyone has all necessities and most desires they can imagine. Conflict now exists over apportionment of services and terrestrial space, since anything else can be had in abundance. Military goods and items of mass destruction may still be restricted, and there is probably some reason locals do not export their vast wealth.

**E**: Frenzied ideologue fighting over idea, Paranoid local fearing offworlder influence, Grim reformer seeking destruction of "enfeebling" productive tech
**F**: Offworlder seeking something available only here, Local struggling to maintain production tech, Native missionary seeking to bring abundance to other worlds

### 62. Preceptor Archive

The Preceptors of Great Archive were pre-Silence organization devoted to ensuring dissemination of human culture, history, and basic technology to frontier worlds that risked losing this information during human expansion. Most frontier planets had Archive where natives could learn useful technical skills in addition to human history and art. Those Archives that managed to survive Silence now strive to send their missionaries of knowledge to new worlds in need of their lore.

**E**: Luddite native, Offworld merchant who wants natives kept ignorant, Religious zealot, Corrupted First Speaker who wants to keep monopoly on learning

**P**: Archive lecture hall, Experimental laboratory, Student-local riot

### 63. Pretech Cultists

The capacities of human science before Silence vastly outmatch technology available since Scream. Jump Gates alone were capable of crossing hundreds of light years in moment, and they were just one example of results won by blending psychic artifice with pretech science. Some worlds outright worship artifacts of their ancestors, seeing in them work of more enlightened and perfect humanity. These cultists may or may not understand operation or replication of these devices, but they seek and guard them jealously.

**E**: Cult leader, Artifact supplier, Pretech smuggler
**F**: Offworld scientist, Robbed collector, Cult heretic
**C**: Cultists can actually replicate certain forms of pretech, Cultists abhor use of devices as "presumption on holy", Cultists mistake party's belongings for pretech

**P**: Alien village, Fortified human settlement, Massacre site

### 65. Prison Planet

This planet is or was intended as prison. Some such prisons were meant for specific malefactors of Terran Mandate, while others were to contain entire "dangerous" ethnic groups or alien races. Some may still have warden AIs or automatic systems to prevent any unauthorized person from leaving, and any authorization permits have long since expired.

**E**: Crazed warden AI, Brutal heir to gang leadership, Offworlder who's somehow acquired warden powers and exploits locals
**F**: Innocent local born here, Native technician forced to maintain very tech that imprisons them, Offworlder trapped here by accident

**P**: Mandate-era prison block converted to government building, Industrial facility manned by mandatory numbers of prisoners, Makeshift shop where contraband is assembled

### 66. Psionics Academy

This world is one of few that have managed to redevelop basics of psychic training. Without this education, potential psychic is doomed to either madness or death unless they refrain from using their abilities. Psionic academies are rare enough that offworlders are often sent there to study by wealthy patrons. Secrets of psychic mentorship, protocols and techniques that allow psychic to successfully train another, are carefully guarded at these academies. Most are closely affiliated with planetary government.

**E**: Mental purity investigator, Suspicious zealot, Witch-finder
**F**: Hidden psychic, Offworlder psychic trapped here, Offworld educator
**C**: Psychic potential is much more common here, Some tech is mistaken as psitech, Natives believe certain rituals and customs can protect them from psychic powers
**T**: Hidden psitech cache, Possessions of convicted psychics, Reward for turning in psychic
**P**: Inquisitorial chamber, Lynching site, Museum of psychic atrocities

### 68. Psionics Worship

These natives view psionic powers as visible gift of god or sign of superiority. If world has functional psychic training academy, psychics occupy almost all major positions of power and are considered natural and proper rulers. If world lacks training facilities, it is likely hodgepodge of demented cults, with each one dedicated to marginally-coherent feral prophet and their psychopathic ravings.

**E**: Psychic inquisitor, Haughty mind-noble, Psychic slaver, Feral prophet
**F**: Offworlder psychic researcher, Native rebel, Offworld employer seeking psychics

**E**: Defense installation commander, Suspicious patrol leader, Crazed asteroid hermit
**F**: Relative of person trapped on world, Humanitarian relief official, Treasure hunter

**P**: Bridge of blockading ship, Defense installation control room, Refugee camp

### 70. Radioactive World

Whether due to legacy of atomic warfare unhindered by nuke snuffers or simple profusion of radioactive elements, this world glows in dark. Even heavy vacc suits can filter only so much radiation, and most natives suffer wide variety of cancers, mutations and other illnesses without protection of advanced medical treatments.

**E**: Bitter mutant, Relic warlord, Desperate would-be escapee
**F**: Reckless prospector, Offworld scavenger, Biogenetic variety seeker

**P**: Palace or seat of government, Salon teeming with spies, Protest rally, Military base

### 73. Restrictive Laws

Myriad of laws, customs, and rules constrain inhabitants of this world, and even acts that are completely permissible elsewhere are punished severely here. Locals may provide lists of these laws to offworlders, but few non-natives can hope to master all important intricacies.

**E**: Law enforcement officer, Outraged native, Native lawyer specializing in peeling offworlders, Paid snitch

**P**: Memorial monument to loss, Cemetery of those who died in conquest, Public ceremony commemorating disaster

### 75. Revolutionaries

The world is convulsed by one or more bands of revolutionaries, with some nations perhaps in grip of current revolution. Most of these upheavals can be expected only to change general flavor of problems in polity, but process of getting there usually produces tremendous amount of suffering.

The world has great many robots on it. Most bots are going to be non-sentient expert systems, though AI with enough computing resources can control many bots at once, and some worlds may have developed VIs to degree that individual bots can seem (or be) sentient.

Local government may be able to keep open war from breaking out, but poisonous hatred divides communities. Nature of faith may be religious, or it may be based on some secular ideology.

**E**: Paranoid believer, Native convinced party is working for other side, Absolutist ruler
**F**: Reformist clergy, Local peacekeeping official, Offworld missionary, Exhausted ruler

**T**: Ancient holy book, Incontrovertible proof, Offering to local holy man
**P**: Sectarian battlefield, Crusading temple, Philosopher's salon, Bitterly divided village

### 84. Seismic Instability

Local land masses are remarkably unstable, and regular earthquakes rack surface. Local construction is either advanced enough to sway and move with vibrations or primitive enough that it is easily rebuilt. Severe volcanic activity may be part of instability.

**E**: Earthquake cultist, Hermit seismologist, Burrowing native life form, Earthquake-inducing saboteur
**F**: Experimental construction firm owner, Adventurous volcanologist, Geothermal prospector

### 85. Shackled World

This world is being systematically contained by outside power. Some ancient autonomous defense grid, robot law enforcement, alien artifact, or other force is preventing locals from developing certain technology, or using certain devices, or perhaps from developing interstellar flight. This limit may or may not apply to offworlders; in former case, PCs may have to figure out way to beat shackles simply to escape world.

**E**: Passionless jailer-AI, Paranoid military grid AI, Robot overlord, Enigmatic alien master
**F**: Struggling local researcher, Offworlder trapped here, Scientist with plan to break chains

**P**: Grim high-tech control center, Factory full of workaround tech, Temple to power or entity that imposed shackle

### 86. Societal Despair

World's dominant society has lost faith in itself. Whether through some all-consuming war, great catastrophe, overwhelming outside culture, or religious collapse, natives no longer believe in their old values, and search desperately for something new. Fierce conflict often exists between last believers in old dispensation and nihilistic or searching disciples of new age.

**E**: Zealot who blames outsiders for decay, Nihilistic warlord, Offworlder looking to exploit local despair
**F**: Struggling messenger of new way, Valiant paragon of fading tradition, Local going through motions of serving now-irrelevant role

**P**: Empty temple, Crowded den of obliviating vice, Smoky hall full of frantic speakers

### 87. Sole Supplier

Some extremely important resource is exported from this world and this world alone. It's unlikely that substance is critical for building spike drives unless this world is also first to begin interstellar flight, but it may be critical to other high-tech processes or devices. Locals make large amount of money off this trade and control of it is of critical importance to planet's rulers, and potentially to outside powers.

**E**: Resource oligarch, Ruthless smuggler, Resource-controlling warlord, Foreign agent seeking to subvert local government
**F**: Doughty resource miner, Researcher trying to synthesize stuff, Small-scale resource producer, Harried starport trade overseer

**P**: Bustling resource extraction site, Opulent palace built with resource money, Lazy town square where everyone lives on resource payments

### 88. Taboo Treasure

Natives here produce something that is both fabulously valuable and strictly forbidden elsewhere in sector. It may be lethally addictive drug, forbidden gengineering tech, vat-grown "perfect slaves", or useful substance that can only be made through excruciating human suffering. This treasure is freely traded on world, but bringing it elsewhere is usually invitation to long prison stay or worse.

**E**: Maker of vile commodity, Smuggler for powerful offworlder, Depraved offworlder here for "fun", Local warlord who controls treasure
**F**: Reformer seeking to end its use, Innovator trying to repurpose treasure in innocent ways, Wretched addict unwillingly prey to treasure

**P**: Den where good is used, Market selling good to locals and few outsiders, Factory or processing area where good is created

### 89. Terraform Failure

This world was marginal for human habitation when it was discovered, but Mandate or early government put in pretech terraforming engines to correct its more extreme qualities. Terraforming did not entirely work, either failing of its own or suffering destruction of engines during Silence. Natives are only partly adapted to world's current state, and struggle with environment.

**E**: Brutal ruler who cares only for their people, Offworlder trying to loot damaged engines, Warlord trying to seize limited habitable land
**F**: Local trying to fix engines, Offworlder student of engines, World-wise native survivor

**P**: Zone of tolerable gravity or temperature, Native settlement built to cope with environment, Massive ruined terraforming engine

### 90. Theocracy

The planet is ruled by priesthood of predominant religion or ideology. Rest of locals may or may not be terribly pious, but clergy have necessary military strength, popular support or control of resources to maintain their rule. Alternative faiths or incompatible ideologies are likely to be both illegal and socially unacceptable.

**E**: Decadent priest-ruler, Zealous inquisitor, Relentless proselytizer, True Believer

**P**: Glorious temple, Austere monastery, Academy for ideological indoctrination, Decadent pleasure-cathedral

### 91. Tomb World

Tomb worlds are planets that were once inhabited by humans before Silence. Sudden collapse of jump gate network and inability to bring in massive food supplies required by planet resulted in starvation, warfare, and death. Most tomb worlds are naturally hostile to human habitation and could not raise sufficient crops to maintain life. Few hydroponic facilities were usually destroyed in fighting, and all that is left now are ruins, bones, and silence.

**E**: Demented survivor tribe chieftain, Avaricious scavenger, Automated defense system, Native predator
**F**: Scavenger Fleet captain, Archaeologist, Salvaging historian, Xenophilic native survivor

### 92. Trade Hub

This world is major crossroads for local interstellar trade. It is well-positioned at nexus of several short-drill trade routes, and has facilities for easy transfer of valuable cargoes and fueling and repairing of starships. Natives are accustomed to outsiders, and polyglot mass of people from every nearby world can be found trading here.

**E**: Cheating merchant, Thieving dockworker, Commercial spy, Corrupt customs official
**F**: Rich tourist, Hardscrabble free trader, Merchant prince in need of catspaws, Friendly spaceport urchin

### 93. Tyranny

Local government is brutal and indifferent to will of people. Laws may or may not exist, but only one that matters is whim of rulers on any given day. Their minions swagger through streets while common folk live in terror of their appetites. Only people who stay wealthy are friends and servants of ruling class.

**E**: Debauched autocrat, Sneering bully-boy, Soulless government official, Occupying army officer

### 94. Unbraked AI

Artificial intelligences are costly and difficult to create, requiring careful sequence of "growth stages" in order to bring them to sentience before artificial limits on cognition speed and learning development are installed. These "brakes" prevent runaway cognition metastasis. This world has "unbraked AI" on it, probably with witting or unwitting corps of servants. Unbraked AIs are quite insane, but they learn and reason with speed impossible for humans, and can demonstrate truly distressing subtlety.

### 95. Urbanized Surface

World's land area is covered with buildings that extend downward for multiple levels. Such worlds either have population in trillions, extremely little land area, or are largely-abandoned due to some past catastrophe. Agriculture and resource extraction are part of urban complex, and there may be advanced maintenance system that may not be entirely under control of present natives.

**E**: Maintenance AI that hates outsiders, Tyrant of habitation block, Deep-dwelling prophet who considers "the sky" blasphemy to be quelled
**F**: Local yearning for wild spaces, Grubby urchin of underlevels, Harried engineer trying to maintain ancient works, Grizzled hab cop

### 96. Utopia

Natural and social conditions on this world have made it paradise for its inhabitants, genuine utopia of happiness and fulfillment. This is normally result of drastic human engineering, including brain-gelding, neurochemical control, personality curbs, or complete "humanity" redefinitions. Even so, natives are extremely happy with their lot, and may wish to extend that joy to poor, sad outsiders.

**E**: Compassionate neurotherapist, Proselytizing native missionary to outsiders, Brutal tyrant who rules through inexorable happiness

### 97. Warlords

The world is plagued by warlords. Numerous powerful men and women control private armies sufficiently strong to cow whatever local government may exist. On lands they claim, their word is law. Most spend their time oppressing their own subjects and murderously pillaging those of their neighbors. Most like to wrap themselves in mantle of ideology, religious fervor, or ostensibly legitimate right to rule.
