# Creating a Stellar Sector

Step-by-step process for creating a playable sector of space.

## Overview

You'll need a sheet of large-hex hex paper (available online). First create a stellar map, then flesh out individual worlds to whatever degree your needs require.

**Remember**: You don't have to create everything right now. Focus on broad strokes and save detail work for worlds you'll need immediately.

## Step 1: Place the Stars

### Sector Map Setup
- Standard sector: 8 hexes wide by 10 hexes high
- Roll 1d10+20 for total number of stars (or choose)

### Star Placement
1. **Random Placement**: For the first 20 stars, roll 1d8 and 1d10 for column and row
2. **Adjacency Rule**: If hex is occupied, place adjacent toward nearest edge
3. **Half-Hexes**: Some columns have only 9 full hexes; if you roll 10, reroll or place at bottom-most full hex
4. **Connection Phase**: Add remaining stars to connect clusters and groupings

### Travel Considerations
- Standard postech spike drives can't reach more than 3 hexes
- Any cluster unreachable within 3 hexes requires pretech-grade drives
- The map is an abstraction reflecting metadimensional space currents

## Step 2: Lay Down the Primary Worlds

### Basic Assumptions
- Each inhabited system has a single primary world initially
- Original colonists sought the most habitable world
- Other planets in system are probably worse than the primary

### World Generation Process
1. **Roll World Tags**: Roll two world tags for each planet (see World Tags Reference)
2. **Roll Atmosphere**: Determine atmospheric conditions
3. **Roll Temperature**: Set climate ranges
4. **Roll Biosphere**: Establish native life conditions
5. **Roll Population**: Set inhabitant numbers
6. **Roll Tech Level**: Determine technological capability
7. **Optional**: Add additional planets or points of interest
8. **Name and Describe**: Give planet a name and sentence of description

### Generation Tips
- Complete one step for all planets before moving to the next
- Don't worry about making tags make sense initially
- Reroll results that make no sense with existing tags, or pick fitting results
- For adventurous GMs: try to explain seemingly incompatible results

## Step 3: Mark Polities and Trade Routes

### Communication Lines
- Identify systems in contact with each other
- Draw lines between them
- Remember: 4+ hex gaps require pretech spike drives
- Contact between distant clusters needs intermediate worlds

### Political Relationships
- Connected worlds know about each other
- May not be friendly, but have basic understanding
- Usually provide some accommodation for foreign visitors
- Sketch "borders" around worlds that seem to belong together

### Government Formation
- Most TL4 worlds can't mount effective interstellar invasions
- Multi-system polities form through:
  - Diplomatic ties
  - Cultural connections  
  - Local hegemon dominance over weaker worlds
- Many sectors have no multi-system governments
- Disjointed sectors make escape easier for PC groups

## Step 4: Build Out the Important Worlds

### Which Worlds to Detail
**Only detail worlds you need for the next session:**
- The starting world
- Worlds PCs might travel to after first session
- Usually means starting world and immediate neighbors

### Cultural Template
Choose a rough cultural template for each important world:
- Historical Earth culture (Latin American, Russian, Byzantine, etc.)
- Culture has changed drastically since founding
- Provides baseline for names, language, food, architecture
- Should be clear enough to answer sudden cultural questions
- Historical accuracy isn't critical

### Adventure Components
Use world tags to create:

**Enemy**: Combine enemies from both tags into single antagonist
- Example: Feral World + Heavy Industry = cannibal oligarch who feeds on slave laborers
- Give name and sentence description

**Friend**: Create helpful contact using tag elements

**Complication**: Generate obstacle or challenge

**Thing**: Important object or device

**Place**: Significant location

### Critical Questions
Answer these questions for each important world:

1. **Value**: What does this world have that PCs might care about?
   - Valuable exports
   - Special technology
   - Job opportunities for expendable offworlders

2. **Conflict**: What's the biggest conflict on the world right now?
   - Social class struggle
   - Tension with offworlders
   - War among local governments
   - Other major crisis

3. **Outsider Relations**: What do they think about outsiders?
   - Comfortable with offworlders
   - Unusual mistrust
   - Outright xenophobia

4. **Law Enforcement**: What is law enforcement like?
   - Special laws that might tangle PCs
   - Enforcement response to lawbreaking
   - Legal system structure

5. **Starport**: Where do PCs land?
   - Major starport name
   - Special deficiencies or opportunities

## Step 5: Choose Factions and Relations

### Interworld Relationships
- Determine relationships between starting world and neighbors
- Decide relationships between any established polities
- Open warfare is hard for lone TL4 worlds to sustain
- More likely: cold wars of spies and saboteurs

### Faction Integration
- Establish 2-3 Factions for campaign start
- Feel free to create new ones or retire old ones as game progresses
- See Faction rules (page 210) for detailed mechanics

## Completion

With these steps complete, your sector is ready for play. The next step is Adventure Creation to generate specific scenarios for your first sessions.
