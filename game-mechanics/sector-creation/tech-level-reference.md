## Understanding Tech Levels

Tech level represents not only level of technological progress and scientific knowledge available on world, but also world's ability to translate that knowledge into effective production. 

**Resource Limitations**: A world might guard texts describing elaborate principles of petrochemical manipulation, but without oil or fossil fuels on planet they have no way to use information. This kind of resource limitation most often keeps world caught at low tech level. Without bottleneck resources such as petrochemicals or radioactives, they can't develop technology that would allow them to do without such resources.

**Variance**: Tech levels are rough approximations, and every planet will have variance within that range. Decayed colony unlikely to have forgotten basics of human anatomy and practical wound care, but may not have local resources to fashion medical tools more sophisticated than obsidian scalpels and herbal poultices. Primitive world might have local resources that are exceptionally useful in one or two narrow ranges of technology.

## Baseline Tech Level

**Tech Level 4** is baseline level of development for planets capable of building:
- Fusion plants
- Spike-drive equipped starships
- Limited longevity enhancements
- Basic energy weapons

Planet without this level of development is effectively cut off from interstellar news and trade without good offices of far traders, explorers, or scavenger fleet contacts.

## Detailed Tech Level Descriptions

### Tech Level 0 (Neolithic)

Represents world with technologies similar to neolithic-era humanity. Very few worlds collapse this far without dying out completely, so world this primitive is very rare in human space.

**Limitations**:
- World so profoundly devoid of useful resources that natives may not have anything better to work with than rocks and native vegetation

**Cultural Development**:
- Natives might retain elaborate cultural artifacts and very sophisticated society
- Existing resources tend to be exploited to hilt
- Large populations producing massive stone cities
- Human-powered engines for irrigation
- Vast displays of foodstuffs and craft work for ruling class
- Despite this, lack of metal, domesticated beasts of burden, and petrochemicals puts hard stop on technological development

**Contact with Outsiders**:
- Responses vary with local culture
- Lack of quick communications methods tends to result in large populations breaking up into numerous smaller regional cultures
- Friendly prince of one domain might neighbor implacably hostile sage-king
- Most "lostworlders" have keen appreciation for benefits strangers from sky can bring
- Will bargain accordingly

**Historical Memory**:
- Some worlds might retain crisply rational records of their colonization and downfall
- Others might preserve tales of starry origin in legends and story
- Few might have forgotten their origins entirely
- View sky-born humans as gods or messengers of divine
- Such awe rarely lasts very long once merchants or pirates make their purposes clear

### Tech Level 1 (Medieval)

Managed to find and exploit metal deposits and likely have imported or domesticated beasts of burden. Those worlds with easy access to fossil fuels or similarly energy-dense substance can advance to greater things, but culture trapped at TL1 is unlikely to have access to such helpful resources.

**Energy Limitations**:
- Few worlds have enough usable plant matter or other combustibles to make steam engines feasible
- Those with very much of such resource usually make leap to next tech level eventually

**Development Plateau**:
- TL1 worlds tend to be caught at much same general level of development as their TL0 cousins
- May have elaborate social structures and cultural development
- Unable to mechanize without some energy-dense resource to serve as fuel
- Scavenged hulks of ancestors' fusion plants may stand as mute temples to achievements of forebears
- Without tech necessary to repair and rebuild such edifices, world is dependent on purely local fuel sources

**Political Capacity**:
- Tend to respond to visitors in much same way as TL0 planets
- Ruling class liable to be able to muster larger cities, bigger armies, and all other perquisites that come from being able to work available agricultural land with fewer hands

### Tech Level 2 (Early Industrial Age)

Blessed with presence of fossil fuels or feasibly abundant biofuel source. Internal combustion engines are crude things compared to power of fusion plant, but they can be built with primitive tools and basic degree of education.

**Mechanization Benefits**:
- Results from this resource vastly increases efficiency of local farming
- Speed of travel
- Productivity of factory workers

**"Knockdown" Worlds**:
- Most TL2 worlds are "knockdowns" - planets that once had much higher degree of sophistication
- Recently crippled by disease, disaster, or invasion
- Natives tend to be keenly aware of glories of former generations
- Work fiercely to redevelop lost techniques and reclaim old knowledge

**Trade Limitations**:
- Few TL2 worlds produce much that's worth interstellar trade
- Most foodstuffs too bulky and cheap to make it worth captain's time
- Some worlds have rare ore deposits, but natives have no reason to dig them until merchant makes it worth their while
- Some barter relics of ancestors in exchange for educational materials or rare resources necessary for advancing local industry
- Others feel forced to trade native work contracts for dangerous, dirty labor in bargain little different from slave trading

### Tech Level 3 (Present-Day Earth)

Developed to level much like that of more advanced nations of late twentieth-century Earth. Main difference between TL3 and TL4 worlds is lack of fusion power or spike drive manufacture.

**Two Major Varieties**:

#### "Knockdown" Worlds
- Formerly had TL4 technologies before some catastrophe or pirate attack destroyed their knowledge and industrial base
- Some of wrecked infrastructure might have been irreplaceable
- World must struggle to regain former level of technological production
- Worlds in this condition tend to have rather small populations susceptible to loss of few concentrated groups of experts

#### Long-Recovery Worlds
- Suffered severe disaster shortly after colonization
- Forced to painstakingly build up technological base ever since
- Some date back to First Wave of colonization thousand years ago
- Driven into near-neolithic conditions by outside pressure before slowly and painfully rebuilding
- Tend to have very large populations if world's climate permits, as they have been colonized for quite some time

**Advancement Challenges**:
- Simply providing world with necessary technical data for advancement doesn't mean advancement will be quick or even
- Even if TL3 world has necessary resources to build TL4 devices, may take as much as generation for world to build necessary infrastructure and resource extraction enterprises
- Time may be longer still if dominant cultures are uneasy with new technology

### Tech Level 4 (Modern Postech)

Most common in human space, and their technical expertise is baseline for modern post-Silence "postech".

**Capabilities**:
- Create spike drives rated up to drive-3
- Fusion power plants
- Grav vehicles
- Simple energy weapons
- Medicines that extend human life to hundred years of vigorous good health
- Sophisticated gengineering on simple life forms
- Some TL4 worlds have attempted to improve genetic structures of human life itself

**Human Gengineering**:
- Attempts have yet to produce results without severe drawbacks
- Some such worlds remain populated by altered humanity designed to cope with local conditions more perfectly than baseline humans

**Prevalence**:
- Most worlds with regular interstellar contact and necessary raw resources eventually gravitate towards this level
- May take decades, or even centuries in case of more retrograde worlds
- This tech level is highest that can readily be achieved by most planets

### Tech Level 4 with Specialties

Unusual case of normal TL4 world that has retained some pretech industries or has developed their own local technical expertise beyond baseline postech in certain specific fields.

**Specialty Scope**:
- Most such specialties are relatively narrow in scope
- Grav tech, medicine, hydroponics, force field generation, or some field of roughly similar breadth
- Usually either product of few irreplaceable pretech manufactories or result of some unique local resource that serves amazingly well for purpose at hand
- In both cases, world will jealously guard tech
- Much local conflict may relate to control over these resources

**Economic Impact**:
- These worlds tend to have substantial amounts of interstellar trade from neighboring worlds interested in their tech
- Ruling elite of world can be ostentatious about display of this wealth

### Tech Level 5 (Pretech)

Highest tech level that might merit random placement. World with this level of technological expertise has somehow managed to hold on to majority of pre-Scream technology base, and can produce wide range of goods that are unknown on less sophisticated worlds.

**Advanced Capabilities**:
- Miniaturized fusion plants
- Drive-6 rated spike drives
- Exotic grav weaponry
- Even development of psionics-based "psitech" is possible

**Manufacturing Limitations**:
- Pretech manufacturing was largely dependent on specially-trained industrial psychics
- With loss of their unique disciplines in Scream, most worlds that retain this level of tech were forced to substitute slower, less precise methods
- Sharply curtailed their production efficiency
- Barring profoundly unlikely happenstance of redevelopment of lost disciplines, their maximum industrial output is sharply limited
- Even on worlds such as this, most technology is likely mass-produced postech
- Only important goods produced to pretech levels of quality

**Political Influence**:
- World with this level of technology is almost certainly regional hegemon
- One of most powerful and influential worlds in sector
- Even those worlds that have no imperial ambitions have enormous influence simply through vast superiority of their starships and military technology

## Technology and Resources

### Bottleneck Resources
Key materials that enable or prevent technological advancement:
- **Petrochemicals**: Essential for early industrial development
- **Radioactives**: Required for fusion power and advanced energy systems
- **Rare Minerals**: Needed for sophisticated electronics and manufacturing
- **Energy Sources**: Dense energy storage and generation capability

### Resource Dependency
Worlds can have knowledge but lack implementation capability due to:
- Missing raw materials
- Inadequate infrastructure
- Insufficient population base
- Environmental limitations

### Technological Preservation
Factors affecting technology retention:
- **Institutional Knowledge**: Schools, libraries, guilds
- **Industrial Base**: Manufacturing capability and expertise
- **Resource Access**: Continued availability of necessary materials
- **Population Stability**: Avoiding losses of key specialists

## Technology and Society

### Social Implications by Tech Level

**TL0-1**: 
- Subsistence agriculture dominates
- Limited specialization possible
- Political authority often personal/charismatic
- High infant mortality, short lifespans

**TL2-3**:
- Industrial revolution effects
- Urbanization begins
- Class distinctions emerge
- Improved transportation and communication

**TL4**:
- Post-scarcity in basic needs achievable
- Extended lifespans standard
- Interstellar communication possible
- Complex political systems sustainable

**TL4+ and TL5**:
- Technological supremacy enables political dominance
- Risk of technological dependence
- Potential for massive social stratification
- Galaxy-spanning influence possible

### Cultural Responses to Technology

**Technology Worship**: Some cultures revere lost pretech as divine
**Technology Fear**: Others view advanced tech as dangerous or corrupting
**Technology Integration**: Successful adaptation of available tech to local conditions
**Technology Denial**: Rejection of advancement due to cultural values

## Advancement Pathways

### Natural Progression
Most worlds follow rough progression through tech levels given sufficient:
- Time (generations to centuries)
