# Scenes and Durations

Many psychic abilities and other powers have durations expressed in scenes. A scene is just a shorthand concept for a particular action sequence or exertion on the part of the PCs.

## What Is a Scene?

A scene represents a single contiguous chunk of action or activity:
- A combat encounter
- Infiltrating a building
- Climbing a radioactive mountainside
- A tense negotiation
- Any focused activity sequence

## Scene Duration

- **Typical Length**: 15 minutes or less
- **Maximum**: GM's discretion
- **Key Factor**: Contiguous action, not clock time

## Scene-Based Powers

### Usage Limits
Some powers can only be used:
- Once per scene
- A limited number of times per scene
- With Effort that returns at scene's end

### Between Scenes
Outside time-critical situations:
- Powers refresh approximately every 15 minutes
- Assumes intervals for rest
- GM determines exact timing

## Examples of Scenes

### Clear Scenes
- **Combat**: From first shot to last enemy down
- **Chase**: From start to escape/capture
- **Heist**: Entering to exiting the target
- **Negotiation**: Opening to final agreement

### Edge Cases
- **Travel**: Usually not a scene unless eventful
- **Planning**: Not a scene unless under pressure
- **Shopping**: Not a scene unless complicated
- **Downtime**: Definitely not a scene

## GM Guidelines

### Starting a Scene
Mark a scene when:
- Initiative is rolled
- Significant risk begins
- Time pressure applies
- Powers might matter

### Ending a Scene
A scene ends when:
- Immediate danger passes
- Objective is achieved/failed
- Action naturally concludes
- Location significantly changes

### Multiple Scenes
An evening's play might include:
- Several combat scenes
- A negotiation scene
- An infiltration scene
- Lots of non-scene time between

## Effort and Scenes

### Scene-Long Effort
- Committed for entire scene
- Returns at scene's end
- Cannot be uncommitted early
- Carries between connected scenes (GM discretion)

### Day-Long Effort
- Persists across all scenes
- Only returns after rest
- More powerful effects
- Strategic resource management

## Common Questions

### Back-to-Back Scenes?
If action flows directly from one scene to another:
- Effort doesn't refresh between
- Powers don't reset
- Treat as one extended scene

### Very Long Scenes?
If a scene runs unusually long:
- GM may allow partial refresh
- Or split into multiple scenes
- Player communication important

### Non-Scene Time?
Between scenes:
- Effort refreshes
- Per-scene powers reset
- Wounds can be treated
- Resources recovered
