## Description
The Icarus harness is a Combat Field Uniform (CFU) upgrade designed for paratroopers and orbital drop infantry. It replaces a conventional parachute with a crude gravity damper that allows the wearer to fall an unlimited distance without harm.

## Special Properties
- All the protection of a standard CFU (AC 16)
- Integrated gravity damper system
- Allows unlimited fall distance without damage
- Functions as a vacc suit for up to 30 minutes per vacc refresh
- Each fall over 3 meters drains one type A power cell

## Gravity Damper System
- Crude but effective anti-gravity technology
- Activates automatically when falling
- No altitude limit for safe landing
- Power consumption only for falls exceeding 3 meters
- More reliable than traditional parachutes

## Vacc Suit Capability
- Emergency life support for 30 minutes
- Allows for high-altitude/orbital drops
- Basic protection against vacuum and radiation
- Not intended for extended EVA operations
- Must be refreshed between uses

## Applications
- Airborne/orbital infantry operations
- High-altitude insertion missions
- Emergency evacuation from tall structures
- Tactical advantages in vertical environments

## Notes
- Named after the mythological Icarus, but with a better ending
- Popular among special forces and rapid deployment units
- The high cost reflects the integrated gravity damper technology
- Combines armor, parachute, and emergency life support in one system
