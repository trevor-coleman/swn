- **Cost**: 10 credits
- **Encumbrance**: 2
- **Tech Level**: 0

## Description
Shields are an ancient yet extremely useful adjunct to body armor. Primitive shields are usually made of wood or stretched hide, while more modern riot shields tend toward clear plastic. All shields require one free hand to use effectively.

## Special Properties
- Grants a base AC of 13 to the user
- If the bearer's AC is already equal or better, the shield simply grants a +1 AC bonus
- Renders the bearer immune to the first instance of melee Shock damage they take each round (assuming the shield is effective against the weapon being used)
- Primitive shields are ignored by all weapons that ignore primitive armor

## Notes
- Against advanced TL4 melee weapons and firearms of all kinds, primitive shields are treated as AC 10
- Requires one free hand to use effectively
- A basic defensive tool that has remained useful throughout the ages
