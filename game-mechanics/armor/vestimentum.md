## Description
A "vestimentum" is a catch-all term for one of the many ancient Mandate ceremonial armors meant chiefly for parade guards, ritual officiants, cultural reenactors, or other roles that put elaborate style at a premium. While these outfits often look wildly unmilitary, their hyper-advanced components and micronized force fields give them the same protection against primitive weapons as any other powered armor.

- Immunity to primitive melee weapons and unarmed attacks
- Immunity to any firearm or grenade-scale explosive of TL3 or less
- Hyper-advanced components providing exceptional protection
- Micronized force fields integrated throughout
- Often features elaborate, ceremonial designs
