## Quick Rules Summary

### Building a Ship
1. Choose hull type (determines base stats)
2. Add weapons (limited by hardpoints)
3. Add defenses (use power/mass)
4. Add fittings (use power/mass)
5. Calculate maintenance (5% cost/6 months)

### Power & Mass
- Each hull has free Power and Mass
- Weapons and fittings consume these resources
- Can trade between them with mods
- Cargo: 1 mass = varied tonnage by hull class

### Cost Multipliers
- Fittings marked * multiply by hull class:
  - Frigate: ×10
  - Cruiser: ×25
  - Capital: ×100
- Power/Mass marked # multiply by:
  - Frigate: ×2
  - Cruiser: ×3
  - Capital: ×4

### Combat Basics
- Rounds are ~15 minutes
- Departments act in captain-chosen order
- Command Points fuel actions
- Can accept 1 Crisis/round instead of damage

### Navigation Basics

- Base DC 7, modified by conditions
- 6 days/hex ÷ drive rating
- In-system: 6/48 hours ÷ drive rating
