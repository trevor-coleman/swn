For defenses marked with # in power/mass:
- Frigate: x2
- Cruiser: x3
- Capital: x4

## Defense Systems

### Ablative Hull Compartments
- **Class**: Capital only
- **Cost**: 100k*
- **Power**: 5
- **Mass**: 2#
- **Effect**: +1 AC, +20 maximum hit points
- **Notes**: Complex system of ablative blast baffles allows large amounts of mass to be shot away without impinging on function.

### Augmented Plating
- **Class**: Fighter+
- **Cost**: 25k*
- **Power**: 0
- **Mass**: 1#
- **Effect**: +2 AC, -1 Speed
- **Notes**: Reinforced armor plating at cost of speed/maneuverability. Can reduce Speed below 0 (becomes penalty to Pilot tests).

### Boarding Countermeasures
- **Class**: Frigate+
- **Cost**: 25k*
- **Power**: 2
- **Mass**: 1#
- **Effect**: Prevents boarding without specialized tools
- **Notes**: Hardened bulkheads, reinforced hatches, automated kill corridors. If breached, ordinary pirates have only 1 in 6 chance of threatening bridge.

### Burst ECM Generator
- **Class**: Frigate+
- **Cost**: 25k*
- **Power**: 2
- **Mass**: 1#
- **Effect**: Negate one successful hit per engagement
- **Notes**: Can be activated after damage rolled. Enemies compensate quickly - only works once per fight.

### Foxer Drones
- **Class**: Cruiser+
- **Cost**: 10k*
- **Power**: 2
- **Mass**: 1#
- **Effect**: +2 AC for one round when fired, Ammo 5
- **Notes**: Short-lived drones with enormous energy signatures. Essentially free to construct, limited by storage space.

### Grav Eddy Displacer
- **Class**: Frigate+
- **Cost**: 50k*
- **Power**: 5
- **Mass**: 2#
- **Effect**: 1 in 6 chance any hit misses entirely
- **Notes**: Links with nav system to randomize motion vectors in sympathy with metadimensional gravitic currents.

### Hardened Polyceramic Overlay
- **Class**: Fighter+
- **Cost**: 25k*
- **Power**: 0
- **Mass**: 1#
- **Effect**: Reduce AP quality of attacks by 5
- **Notes**: Complex glazing process hardens armor surface to more effectively shed incoming attacks.

### Planetary Defense Array
- **Class**: Frigate+
- **Cost**: 50k*
- **Power**: 4
- **Mass**: 2#
- **Effect**: Anti-bombardment surface defenses
- **Notes**: Gravitic braker guns and upgraded nuke snuffer field. Protects hemisphere from nuclear attacks and unpowered bombardment. Cannot stop powered penetrators but makes pinpoint strikes impractical.

### Point Defense Lasers
- **Class**: Frigate+
- **Cost**: 10k*
- **Power**: 3
- **Mass**: 2#
- **Effect**: +2 AC versus weapons using ammo
- **Notes**: Small lasers destroy incoming munitions. Effective against torpedoes, fractal charges, and other ammo-based weapons.

## Defensive Considerations

### Against Fighters
- Point Defense Lasers excel vs fighter torpedoes
- Foxer Drones provide temporary reprieve
- Augmented Plating helps survive swarming

### Against Cruisers
- Hardened Polyceramic crucial vs AP weapons
- Ablative Hull Compartments for extended fights
- Grav Eddy Displacer for lucky escapes

### Against Boarding
- Boarding Countermeasures essential
- Point Defense vs breaching charges
- Foxer Drones can buy time to repel boarders

### Stealth Operations
- Combine with Emissions Dampers fitting
- Avoid Foxer Drones (too visible)
- Consider minimal defense for lower signature
