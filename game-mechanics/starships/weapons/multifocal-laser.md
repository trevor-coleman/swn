# Multifocal Laser

## Overview
Twinned assay and penetration lasers modulate the frequency of this beam for remarkable armor penetration. These weapons are popular choices for fighters intended for frigate or cruiser engagement.

## Statistics
- **Cost**: 100,000 credits
- **Damage**: 1d4
- **Power**: 5
- **Mass**: 1
- **Hardpoints**: 1
- **Minimum Class**: Fighter
- **Tech Level**: 4
- **Qualities**: AP 20

## Special Properties

### Armor Penetration (AP 20)
This weapon ignores 20 points of a target's armor rating, making it exceptionally effective against heavily armored ships. This makes the multifocal laser ideal for fighter craft engaging larger warships.

## Tactical Usage
- **Primary Role**: Anti-ship fighter weapon
- **Best Against**: Frigates and cruisers
- **Weakness**: Low damage output
- **Strategy**: Use superior penetration to damage critical systems

## Design Notes
The multifocal laser represents a triumph of modulation technology, using frequency-shifting algorithms to find the optimal wavelength for penetrating specific armor compositions. While it deals relatively light damage, its ability to bypass most armor makes it invaluable for fighter strikes against capital ships.

## Installation Requirements
- Fighter-class hull or larger
- 5 units of free power
- 1 unit of free mass
- 1 available hardpoint
- TL4 shipyard facilities

## Combat Performance
- **Attack Roll**: Gunner's Int/Dex modifier + Shoot skill
- **Damage Roll**: 1d4 + Int/Dex modifier
- **Effective Against**: All ship classes due to AP 20
- **Fighter Combat**: Can use Pilot skill instead of Shoot

## Comparison
- More penetration than Reaper Battery
- Less damage than most weapons
- No ammunition requirements
- No special limitations
