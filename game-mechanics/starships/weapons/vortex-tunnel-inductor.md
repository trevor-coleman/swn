# Vortex Tunnel Inductor

## Overview
A capital-class model of the SIP, a VTI is capable of incapacitating a cruiser in two hits. Its bulk limits its utility against fighter-class craft, however.

## Statistics
- **Cost**: 5,000,000 credits
- **Damage**: 3d20
- **Power**: 20
- **Mass**: 10
- **Hardpoints**: 4
- **Minimum Class**: Capital
- **Tech Level**: 4
- **Qualities**: AP 20, Clumsy

## Special Properties

### Armor Penetration (AP 20)
Exceptional penetration through metadimensional phasing effects.

### Clumsy
- -4 to hit fighter-class hulls
- Massive targeting systems optimized for capital warfare
- Creates large-scale dimensional distortions

### Vortex Generation
Creates a metadimensional vortex that:
- Tunnels through normal space
- Devastating internal damage
- System-wide disruptions
- Potential hull breaches

## Tactical Usage
- **Primary Role**: Capital ship devastator
- **Best Against**: Cruisers and battleships
- **Weakness**: Cannot target small craft effectively
- **Strategy**: Two-shot cruiser kills

## Design Notes
The vortex tunnel inductor scales up spike inversion technology to capital-weapon scale. Rather than a focused beam, it creates a swirling vortex of metadimensional energy that tunnels through space-time itself, causing catastrophic damage to anything in its path. The sheer scale of dimensional distortion makes it devastating against large targets.

## Installation Requirements
- Capital-class hull only
- 20 units of free power
- 10 units of free mass
- 4 available hardpoints
- TL4 capital shipyard
- Massive spike drive integration
- Dedicated power systems

## Combat Performance
- **Attack Roll**: Gunner's Int/Dex modifier + Shoot skill
  - -4 penalty vs fighter-class hulls
- **Damage Roll**: 3d20 + Int/Dex modifier
- **Effective Against**: Cruisers and capital ships
- **Special**: Can disable cruiser in 2 hits

## Vortex Mechanics
The weapon creates:
- Dimensional tunnel effect
- Spiraling energy vortex
- Space-time distortions
- Cascading system failures

## Power Draw
Highest conventional requirement:
- 20 units continuous
- Dedicated reactor advised
- Massive capacitor banks
- Ship-wide power management

## Scale of Destruction
Against cruisers:
- Average 30+ damage per hit
- 2 hits typically fatal
- Penetrates heaviest armor
- Causes massive system damage

## Comparison to Capital Weapons
| Weapon | Damage | AP | Power | vs Cruisers |
|--------|---------|-----|--------|-------------|
| VTI | 3d20 | 20 | 20 | 2 hits |
| Mass Cannon | 2d20 | 20 | 10 | 3-4 hits |
| Lightning | 1d20 | 5 | 15 | Many hits |

## Dimensional Effects
Vortex strikes cause:
- Localized space warping
- Temporal distortions
- Navigation failures
- Communication blackouts

## Capital Ship Doctrine
VTI-equipped battleships:
- Priority target elimination
- Cruiser pack hunters
- Siege breakers
- Fleet anchors

## Engineering Marvel
Requires integration of:
- Capital spike drives
- Vortex containment
- Dimensional calculators
- Massive field generators

## Tactical Limitations
- Useless against fighters
- Massive power drain
- Slow target acquisition
- Limited firing rate

## Historical Significance
Development marked:
- New era of capital warfare
- Cruiser vulnerability
- Battleship supremacy
- Arms race escalation

## Countermeasures
Very limited options:
- Maximum engagement range
- Fighter screen harassment
- Preemptive strike
- Multiple cruiser wolfpack

## Maintenance Complexity
- Dimensional calibration monthly
- Vortex generator overhaul
- Spike drive synchronization
- Exotic matter replenishment

## Crew Requirements
Operation needs:
- Specialized gunners
- Dimensional physicists
- Spike drive engineers
- Dedicated power team

## Combat Examples
Typical engagement:
- Turn 1: First hit, cruiser crippled
- Turn 2: Second hit, cruiser destroyed
- Massive psychological impact
- Fleet morale effects

## System Integration
Affects entire ship:
- Main spike drive linked
- Power grid dedicated
- Navigation compromised during fire
- Ship-wide combat alerts

## Future Warfare
VTI technology suggests:
- Even larger weapons possible
- Dimensional warfare doctrine
- New defensive needs
- Capital ship evolution
