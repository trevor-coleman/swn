# Torpedo Launcher

## Overview
Capable of damaging even a battleship, torpedoes are cumbersome, expensive, and often the core of a line frigate's armament.

## Statistics
- **Cost**: 500,000 credits (2,500 cr per torpedo)
- **Damage**: 3d8
- **Power**: 10
- **Mass**: 3
- **Hardpoints**: 1
- **Minimum Class**: Frigate
- **Tech Level**: 4
- **Qualities**: AP 20, Ammo 4

## Special Properties

### Armor Penetration (AP 20)
High penetration allows torpedoes to threaten even heavily armored capital ships.

### Ammo 4
- Requires torpedo ammunition
- 4 torpedoes fit in 1 mass unit
- Each torpedo costs 2,500 credits
- Launcher includes 1 mass unit (4 torpedoes) free

## Tactical Usage
- **Primary Role**: Capital ship engagement
- **Best Against**: Large, slow targets
- **Weakness**: Expensive ammunition
- **Strategy**: Alpha strikes and decisive shots

## Design Notes
Torpedoes are self-propelled, guided munitions carrying powerful warheads. Unlike simple projectiles, they can track targets and adjust course, making them ideal for long-range engagements. Their size and complexity make them expensive, but their effectiveness against capital ships justifies the cost for many frigates.

## Installation Requirements
- Frigate-class hull or larger
- 10 units of free power
- 3 units of free mass
- 1 available hardpoint
- TL4 shipyard facilities
- Torpedo magazine

## Combat Performance
- **Attack Roll**: Gunner's Int/Dex modifier + Shoot skill
- **Damage Roll**: 3d8 + Int/Dex modifier
- **Effective Against**: All ship classes
- **Special**: Can threaten battleships

## Ammunition Logistics
- Base loadout: 4 torpedoes
- Additional storage: 1 mass = 4 torpedoes
- Larger hulls double capacity:
  - Cruiser: 8 torpedoes per mass
  - Capital: 16 torpedoes per mass
- Reload time: 1 full round

## Torpedo Characteristics
- Guided munitions with limited AI
- Effective range: Long
- Countermeasures: Possible but difficult
- Warhead types: Standard, specialized available

## Frigate Doctrine
Line frigates typically:
- Mount 1-2 torpedo launchers
- Carry 12-20 torpedoes total
- Use torpedoes for alpha strikes
- Reserve shots for high-value targets

## Cost Analysis
- Initial investment: 500,000 credits
- Per volley: 10,000 credits (4 torpedoes)
- Resupply considerations critical
- Often determines engagement length

## Comparison
- Highest frigate-class damage potential
- Excellent armor penetration
- Very expensive per shot
- High power requirement

## Historical Note
Torpedo launchers have remained largely unchanged since their development, as the basic principle of "large guided explosive" remains timelessly effective.
