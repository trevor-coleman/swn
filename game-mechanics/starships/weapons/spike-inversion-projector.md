# Spike Inversion Projector

## Overview
The SIP uses the ship's spike phasing as an offensive weapon, penetrating the target with a brief incursion of MES energies that largely ignore attempts to evade.

## Statistics
- **Cost**: 2,500,000 credits
- **Damage**: 3d8
- **Power**: 10
- **Mass**: 3
- **Hardpoints**: 3
- **Minimum Class**: Cruiser
- **Tech Level**: 4
- **Qualities**: AP 15

## Special Properties

### Armor Penetration (AP 15)
Good armor penetration from metadimensional energy effects.

### Metadimensional Strike
The weapon partially phases attacks through spike drive dimensions:
- Partially bypasses physical space
- Difficult to evade or intercept
- Causes internal damage
- Disrupts enemy systems

## Tactical Usage
- **Primary Role**: Precision cruiser weapon
- **Best Against**: Evasive targets
- **Strength**: Hard to dodge
- **Strategy**: Surgical strikes

## Design Notes
The spike inversion projector weaponizes the same metadimensional energies used for FTL travel. By creating a localized spike field inversion, it projects destructive energies partially through higher dimensions, making the attack extremely difficult to evade through conventional maneuvering.

## Installation Requirements
- Cruiser-class hull or larger
- 10 units of free power
- 3 units of free mass
- 3 available hardpoints
- TL4 shipyard facilities
- Integration with spike drive
- MES field generators

## Combat Performance
- **Attack Roll**: Gunner's Int/Dex modifier + Shoot skill
- **Damage Roll**: 3d8 + Int/Dex modifier
- **Effective Against**: All ship classes
- **Special**: Reduced effectiveness of evasive maneuvers

## Spike Drive Integration
Requires connection to:
- Ship's spike drive systems
- Metadimensional calculations
- Phase field generators
- Navigation computers

## How It Works
1. Spike drive creates dimensional bubble
2. Field inverted and compressed
3. Energy projected at target
4. Partial phase through higher dimensions
5. Materialization inside target shields

## Advantages
- Extremely difficult to evade
- Bypasses some defenses
- Moderate power requirement
- Good damage output
- Disrupts enemy systems

## Tactical Applications
SIP excels against:
- High-mobility targets
- ECM-heavy opponents
- Ships relying on evasion
- Precision component strikes

## System Disruption
MES energy causes:
- Electronics interference
- Navigation disruption
- Spike drive instability
- Sensor ghosting

## Comparison to Alternatives
| Weapon | Damage | Special | Power |
|--------|---------|----------|--------|
| SIP | 3d8 | Hard to evade | 10 |
| Gravcannon | 4d6 | AP 20 | 15 |
| Spinal Beam | 3d10 | Clumsy | 10 |

## Defensive Countermeasures
Limited options:
- MES shielding (rare)
- Spike drive jamming
- Extreme range
- Preemptive strikes

## Side Effects
Using SIP may cause:
- Temporary spike instability
- Navigation interference
- Local dimensional flux
- Sensor anomalies

## Fleet Coordination
SIP-equipped ships:
- Target priority systems
- Coordinate with conventional weapons
- Exploit system disruption
- Support capital strikes

## Engineering Challenges
- Spike drive synchronization
- Phase field containment
- Power surge management
- Dimensional calculations

## Historical Development
Created by reverse-engineering:
- Spike drive accidents

- MES field stabilizers
- Complex calculations updates

## Combat Doctrine
Best practices:
- Target critical systems
- Exploit disruption effects
- Coordinate fleet attacks
- Maintain spike readiness

## Limitations
- Cannot fire during spike charge
