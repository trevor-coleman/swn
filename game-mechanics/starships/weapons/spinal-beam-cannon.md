# Spinal Beam Cannon

## Overview
One of the first spinal-mount class weapons, the SBC briefly channels the full power of the ship into a charged beam. It lacks the power and penetration of the more advanced gravcannon, but also takes less power to mount.

## Statistics
- **Cost**: 1,500,000 credits
- **Damage**: 3d10
- **Power**: 10
- **Mass**: 5
- **Hardpoints**: 3
- **Minimum Class**: Cruiser
- **Tech Level**: 4
- **Qualities**: AP 15, Clumsy

## Special Properties

### Armor Penetration (AP 15)
Significant armor penetration allows engagement of heavily armored cruisers and threatening capital ships.

### Clumsy
- -4 to hit fighter-class hulls
- Spinal mount limits traversal speed
- Designed for large target engagement

### Spinal Mount
The weapon runs along the ship's primary axis:
- Requires aiming entire ship
- Limited firing arc
- Structural integration required
- Cannot be retrofitted easily

## Tactical Usage
- **Primary Role**: Cruiser ship-killer
- **Best Against**: Other cruisers, capital ships
- **Weakness**: Poor maneuverability
- **Strategy**: Alpha strike doctrine

## Design Notes
The spinal beam cannon represents a fundamental shift in warship design philosophy. Rather than mounting weapons on hardpoints, the SBC is built into the ship's superstructure, allowing it to channel massive energy directly from the main power plant through the ship's spine.

## Installation Requirements
- Cruiser-class hull or larger
- 10 units of free power
- 5 units of free mass
- 3 available hardpoints
- TL4 shipyard facilities
- Structural reinforcement
- Dedicated power conduits

## Combat Performance
- **Attack Roll**: Gunner's Int/Dex modifier + Shoot skill
  - -4 penalty vs fighter-class hulls
- **Damage Roll**: 3d10 + Int/Dex modifier
- **Effective Against**: Cruisers and capital ships
- **Firing Arc**: Limited, requires ship alignment

## Power Channeling
The SBC operates by:
- Drawing directly from main reactor
- Storing charge in capacitor banks
- Channeling through ship's spine
- Brief but massive energy discharge

## Cruiser Design Impact
Ships with spinal beam cannons:
- Built around the weapon
- Elongated hull design
- Reinforced superstructure
- Limited maneuverability

## Comparison to Gravcannon
| Feature | SBC | Gravcannon |
|---------|-----|------------|
| Damage | 3d10 | 4d6 |
| AP | 15 | 20 |
| Power | 10 | 15 |
| Mass | 5 | 4 |
| Cost | 1.5m | 2m |

## Tactical Doctrine
Spinal beam tactics:
- Long-range engagement
- Alpha strike priority
- Focus fire coordination
- Minimal maneuvering

## Engineering Challenges
- Heat dissipation along spine
- Structural stress during firing
- Power fluctuations ship-wide
- Targeting computer integration

## Fleet Role
SBC-equipped cruisers serve as:
- Line breakers
- Capital ship hunters
- Long-range artillery
- Deterrent forces

## Advantages
- High damage potential
- Good armor penetration
- Lower power than gravcannon
- Proven technology

## Disadvantages
- Poor anti-fighter capability
- Limited firing arc
- Ship design constraints
- Predictable attack patterns

## Historical Significance
First successful spinal mount weapon:
- Changed cruiser design philosophy
- Proved large weapon feasibility
- Led to gravcannon development
- Set capital ship standards

## Maintenance Requirements
- Spine alignment checks
- Capacitor bank replacement
- Structural integrity scans
- Power conduit maintenance

## Combat Examples
Effective scenarios:
- Cruiser duels at range
- Breaking defensive lines
- Station assault
- Capital ship damage
