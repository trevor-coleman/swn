# Gravcannon

## Overview
Using much the same principles as man-portable grav weaponry, the gravcannon causes targets to fall apart in a welter of mutually-antagonistic gravitic fields.

## Statistics
- **Cost**: 2,000,000 credits
- **Damage**: 4d6
- **Power**: 15
- **Mass**: 4
- **Hardpoints**: 3
- **Minimum Class**: Cruiser
- **Tech Level**: 4
- **Qualities**: AP 20

## Special Properties

### Armor Penetration (AP 20)
Exceptional armor penetration allows the gravcannon to threaten even the heaviest capital ship armor.

### Gravitic Disruption
The weapon creates localized gravitational anomalies that:
- Tear apart molecular bonds
- Bypass conventional armor
- Cause catastrophic structural failure
- Ignore many defensive systems

## Tactical Usage
- **Primary Role**: Capital ship killer
- **Best Against**: Heavily armored targets
- **Strength**: Extreme penetration
- **Strategy**: Precision strikes on vital systems

## Design Notes
The gravcannon scales up portable gravitic weapon technology to ship-mounted sizes. By creating overlapping fields of contradictory gravitational forces, it literally tears targets apart at the molecular level. This bypasses most conventional armor through sheer physics rather than kinetic or thermal energy.

## Installation Requirements
- Cruiser-class hull or larger
- 15 units of free power
- 4 units of free mass
- 3 available hardpoints
- TL4 shipyard facilities
- Gravitic field generators
- Specialized targeting computers

## Combat Performance
- **Attack Roll**: Gunner's Int/Dex modifier + Shoot skill
- **Damage Roll**: 4d6 + Int/Dex modifier
- **Effective Against**: All ship classes
- **Special Effects**: Structural damage beyond HP

## Gravitic Field Generation
The weapon creates:
- Localized gravity wells
- Tidal force differentials
- Molecular disruption zones
- Cascading structural failure

## Power Requirements
Highest of cruiser weapons:
- 15 units continuous draw
- Massive capacitor banks
- Dedicated reactor recommended
- Power management critical

## Advantages Over Spinal Beam
- More compact design
- Better damage consistency
- Higher armor penetration
- No spinal mount needed
- More flexible mounting

## Tactical Applications
Gravcannons excel at:
- Disabling capital ships
- Penetrating heavy defenses
- Precision component targeting
- Long-range engagement

## Field Effects
Gravitic weapons cause:
- Hull breaches
- System failures
- Crew casualties
- Electronic disruption

## Comparison Chart
| Weapon | Damage | AP | Power | Mass |
|--------|---------|-----|--------|------|
| Gravcannon | 4d6 | 20 | 15 | 4 |
| Spinal Beam | 3d10 | 15 | 10 | 5 |
| Plasma Beam | 3d6 | 10 | 5 | 2 |

## Fleet Doctrine
Gravcannon cruisers serve as:
- Capital ship hunters
- Siege breakers
- Deterrent forces
- Elite strike units

## Maintenance Challenges
- Gravitic calibration critical
- Field generator replacement
- Exotic matter requirements
- Specialized technicians needed

## Cost Justification
Despite high cost:
- Unmatched penetration
- Reliable damage
- Versatile targeting
- Prestige weapon

## Historical Impact
Introduction changed:
- Capital ship armor design
- Fleet engagement ranges
- Cruiser roles
- Defense priorities

## Countermeasures
Limited options include:
- Gravitic shielding (rare)
- Extreme range
- Fighter screens
- Preemptive strikes

## Power Management
Ships typically:
- Reduce other systems
- Install larger reactors
- Use capacitor banks
- Cycle weapon power

## Targeting Considerations
Best used against:
- Engine sections
- Command bridges
- Weapon emplacements
- Reactor cores
