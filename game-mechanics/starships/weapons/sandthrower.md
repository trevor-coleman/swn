# Sandthrower

## Overview
Projecting a spray of tiny, dense particulate matter, sandthrowers are highly effective against lightly-armored fighters.

## Statistics
- **Cost**: 50,000 credits
- **Damage**: 2d4
- **Power**: 3
- **Mass**: 1
- **Hardpoints**: 1
- **Minimum Class**: Fighter
- **Tech Level**: 4
- **Qualities**: Flak

## Special Properties

### Flak
Against fighter-class hulls, these weapons roll hit rolls and damage rolls twice and take the better result. This makes them exceptionally dangerous to small ships that rely on speed over thick armor.

## Tactical Usage
- **Primary Role**: Anti-fighter defense
- **Best Against**: Fighter-class ships
- **Weakness**: Ineffective vs larger ships
- **Strategy**: Fighter screen suppression

## Design Notes
The sandthrower uses magnetic acceleration to launch clouds of ultra-dense microparticles. While these particles lack the mass to damage larger ships significantly, they create a devastating hazard zone for fighters, shredding control surfaces and penetrating cockpit seals.

## Installation Requirements
- Fighter-class hull or larger
- 3 units of free power
- 1 unit of free mass
- 1 available hardpoint
- TL4 shipyard facilities

## Combat Performance
- **Attack Roll**: Gunner's Int/Dex modifier + Shoot skill
  - vs Fighters: Roll twice, take better
- **Damage Roll**: 2d4 + Int/Dex modifier
  - vs Fighters: Roll twice, take better
- **Effective Against**: Fighter-class only
- **Fighter Combat**: Can use Pilot skill instead of Shoot

## Anti-Fighter Specialist
The Flak quality makes sandthrowers devastating against fighters:
- Effectively doubles hit chance
- Maximizes damage potential
- Low power requirement
- Cost-effective fighter defense

## Particle Cloud Effects
The particulate spray:
- Creates area denial zones
- Damages sensors and viewports
- Clogs intake systems
- Ablates light armor

## Comparison
- Lower cost than most weapons
- Minimal power requirement
- Specialized anti-fighter role
- No effect on larger ships

## Defensive Configurations
Common mounting patterns:
- Escort fighters for bomber protection
- Frigate point defense
- Station fighter suppression
- Convoy escort armament

## Limitations
- No armor penetration
- Cannot damage ships above fighter class
- Short effective range
- Requires fighter targets
