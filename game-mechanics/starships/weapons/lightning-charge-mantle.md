# Lightning Charge Mantle

## Overview
Modulation of the ship's power core emits a cloak of MES lightning. While larger spike drive craft can shunt the energies away harmlessly, fighter-class ships are almost invariably destroyed if hit.

## Statistics
- **Cost**: 4,000,000 credits
- **Damage**: 1d20
- **Power**: 15
- **Mass**: 5
- **Hardpoints**: 2
- **Minimum Class**: Capital
- **Tech Level**: 4
- **Qualities**: AP 5, Cloud

## Special Properties

### Armor Penetration (AP 5)
Limited penetration, but sufficient for fighter-class vessels.

### Cloud
- Automatically targets all fighters that attacked in the past round
- One attack roll against each fighter
- No effect on larger ships
- Creates lightning field around ship

### MES Lightning Field
The mantle creates:
- Metadimensional energy discharge
- Coruscating lightning shell
- Automatic fighter defense
- Visual deterrent effect

## Tactical Usage
- **Primary Role**: Capital ship fighter defense
- **Best Against**: Fighter swarms
- **Weakness**: Low damage vs armored targets
- **Strategy**: Automated area denial

## Design Notes
The lightning charge mantle uses controlled modulation of the capital ship's massive power core to create a shell of metadimensional lightning around the vessel. This energy field automatically discharges at any fighter-class vessel that approaches, creating an nearly impenetrable defensive barrier against small craft.

## Installation Requirements
- Capital-class hull only
- 15 units of free power
- 5 units of free mass
- 2 available hardpoints
- TL4 capital shipyard
- Core modulation systems
- MES field generators

## Combat Performance
- **Attack Roll**: Gunner's Int/Dex modifier + Shoot skill
  - One roll per fighter automatically
- **Damage Roll**: 1d20 + Int/Dex modifier
- **Effective Against**: Fighters only
- **Special**: Always active defense

## Field Generation
Power core modulation creates:
- Continuous energy field
- Automatic discharge system
- 360-degree coverage
- No blind spots

## Anti-Fighter Excellence
Against fighters:
- Average 10+ damage
- Automatic targeting
- No gunner attention needed
- Psychological deterrent

## Power Core Integration
Requires:
- Direct core access
- Modulation controls
- Safety limiters
- Discharge regulators

## Comparison to Smart Cloud
| Feature | Lightning Mantle | Smart Cloud |
|---------|------------------|-------------|
| Damage | 1d20 | 3d10 |
| AP | 5 | 0 |
| Auto-target | Yes | Yes |
| Power | 15 | 10 |

## Visual Effects
The mantle creates:
- Spectacular lightning show
- Constant energy corona
- Fighter deterrent display
- Intimidation factor

## Defensive Advantages
- Always active when powered
- No ammunition needed
- Covers all approaches
- Frees gunners for other targets

## Fighter Pilot Nightmare
Lightning mantles are feared for:
- Automatic death sentence
- No safe approach angle
- Spectacular pilot deaths
- Complete area denial

## Capital Ship Doctrine
Ships with mantles:
- Ignore fighter threats
- Focus on capital combat
- Operate independently
- Project power freely

## Energy Field Properties
MES lightning:
- Seeks fighter hulls
- Penetrates light armor
- Disrupts electronics
- Causes instant death

## Historical Impact
Introduction changed:
- Fighter doctrine completely
- Capital ship independence
- Fleet composition
- Attack strategies

## Limitations
- No effect on frigates+
- High power draw
- Capital ships only
- Cannot discriminate targets

## Maintenance Requirements
- Power core synchronization
- Field generator replacement
- Safety system checks
- Discharge calibration

## Integration Challenges
- Core access required
- Complex modulation
- Safety concerns
- Power management

## Fleet Coordination
Mantle-equipped ships:
- Lead formations
- Draw fighter attacks
- Protect vulnerable ships
- Enable capital focus

## Counter-Fighter Supremacy
Statistics show:
- 95%+ fighter kill rate
- Automatic operation
- Pilot morale destroyer
- Changes engagement rules

## Power Management
Operation requires:
- Dedicated power allocation
- Core modulation priority
- Reduced other systems
- Careful balance

## Future Applications
Research continues on:
- Frigate-targeting versions
- Reduced power draws
- Selective targeting
- Offensive applications

## Combat Integration
Works best with:
- Long-range capital weapons
- Other Cloud defenses
- Fighter launch bays
- Point defense arrays
