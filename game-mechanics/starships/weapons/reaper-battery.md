# Reaper Battery

## Overview
Stepped tapping of the spike drive power plant allows for the emission of a torrent of charged particles. The particles have very little armor penetration, but can fry a small ship's power grid in a strike or two.

## Statistics
- **Cost**: 100,000 credits
- **Damage**: 3d4
- **Power**: 4
- **Mass**: 1
- **Hardpoints**: 1
- **Minimum Class**: Fighter
- **Tech Level**: 4
- **Qualities**: Clumsy

## Special Properties

### Clumsy
This weapon suffers -4 to hit small fighter-class hulls due to slow discharge time and unwieldy engineering requirements. Against larger targets, it performs normally.

## Tactical Usage
- **Primary Role**: Anti-civilian ship weapon
- **Best Against**: Lightly armored targets
- **Weakness**: Poor accuracy vs fighters
- **Strategy**: Overwhelm power systems with raw damage

## Design Notes
The reaper battery directly taps the spike drive's power systems, creating an unstable but devastating particle stream. While lacking sophisticated targeting systems, the sheer volume of charged particles can overload unprotected systems quickly.

## Installation Requirements
- Fighter-class hull or larger
- 4 units of free power
- 1 unit of free mass
- 1 available hardpoint
- TL4 shipyard facilities

## Combat Performance
- **Attack Roll**: Gunner's Int/Dex modifier + Shoot skill (-4 vs fighters)
- **Damage Roll**: 3d4 + Int/Dex modifier
- **Effective Against**: Civilian ships, unarmored targets
- **Fighter Combat**: Can use Pilot skill instead of Shoot

## Power Grid Damage
The reaper battery's charged particles are particularly effective at disrupting ship power systems:
- High damage potential (3-12 base)
- Can disable systems even without hull penetration
- Cumulative effect on repeated hits

## Comparison
- Higher damage than Multifocal Laser
- No armor penetration
- Lower power requirement
- Accuracy penalty vs small targets

## Civilian Ship Killer
This weapon excels against:
- Free merchants
- Civilian shuttles
- Unarmored scouts
- System boats without military armor
