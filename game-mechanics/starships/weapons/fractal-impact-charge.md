# Fractal Impact Charge

## Overview
A spray of penetrator sabots that use fractal surfacing to increase impact. Favored for bomber-class fighter hulls.

## Statistics
- **Cost**: 200,000 credits (500 cr per round)
- **Damage**: 2d6
- **Power**: 5
- **Mass**: 1
- **Hardpoints**: 1
- **Minimum Class**: Fighter
- **Tech Level**: 4
- **Qualities**: AP 15, Ammo 4

## Special Properties

### Armor Penetration (AP 15)
Ignores 15 points of target armor, making it effective against moderately armored warships.

### Ammo 4
- Requires ammunition to fire
- 4 rounds fit in 1 mass unit
- Each round costs 500 credits
- Weapon includes 1 mass unit (4 rounds) free

## Tactical Usage
- **Primary Role**: Anti-warship bomber weapon
- **Best Against**: Frigates and light cruisers
- **Weakness**: Limited ammunition
- **Strategy**: Make each shot count on attack runs

## Design Notes
The fractal impact charge uses advanced mathematics to create projectiles with infinitely complex surface patterns. These patterns maximize kinetic energy transfer on impact, allowing fighter-mounted weapons to threaten much larger vessels.

## Installation Requirements
- Fighter-class hull or larger
- 5 units of free power
- 1 unit of free mass
- 1 available hardpoint
- TL4 shipyard facilities
- Ammunition storage

## Combat Performance
- **Attack Roll**: Gunner's Int/Dex modifier + Shoot skill
- **Damage Roll**: 2d6 + Int/Dex modifier
- **Effective Against**: Warships up to cruiser class
- **Fighter Combat**: Can use Pilot skill instead of Shoot

## Ammunition Management
- Base loadout: 4 rounds
- Additional ammo: 1 mass = 4 rounds
- Larger hulls double ammo per mass:
  - Frigate: 8 rounds per mass
  - Cruiser: 16 rounds per mass
  - Capital: 32 rounds per mass

## Bomber Configuration
Ideal for fighter-bombers because:
- Good balance of damage and penetration
- Ammunition allows sustained operations
- Cost-effective vs torpedoes
- Suitable for hit-and-run tactics

## Comparison
- More damage than beam weapons
- Moderate armor penetration
- Ammunition dependent
- No accuracy penalties
