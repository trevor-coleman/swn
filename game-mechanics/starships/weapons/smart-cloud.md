# Smart Cloud

## Overview
A swarm of self-directed microdrones sweeps over the ship. Their integral beam weaponry is too small to damage larger ships, but they can wipe out an attacking fighter wave.

## Statistics
- **Cost**: 2,000,000 credits
- **Damage**: 3d10
- **Power**: 10
- **Mass**: 5
- **Hardpoints**: 2
- **Minimum Class**: Cruiser
- **Tech Level**: 4
- **Qualities**: Cloud, Clumsy

## Special Properties

### Cloud
- Automatically targets all fighter-class ships that attacked within the past round
- Gunner makes one attack roll against each fighter
- No effect on ships larger than fighter-class
- Creates defensive perimeter around ship

### Clumsy
- -4 to hit fighter-class hulls (somewhat offset by Cloud targeting all fighters)
- Microdrones take time to acquire targets
- Less effective against individual fighters

## Tactical Usage
- **Primary Role**: Cruiser anti-fighter defense
- **Best Against**: Fighter swarms
- **Weakness**: Useless vs larger ships
- **Strategy**: Area denial and fighter suppression

## Design Notes
The smart cloud system deploys thousands of semi-autonomous microdrones, each equipped with miniaturized beam weapons and target acquisition systems. When activated, these drones form a protective cloud around the ship, engaging any fighter that ventures too close. The swarm intelligence allows coordinated attacks while preventing friendly fire.

## Installation Requirements
- Cruiser-class hull or larger
- 10 units of free power
- 5 units of free mass
- 2 available hardpoints
- TL4 shipyard facilities
- Drone storage bays
- Command/control systems

## Combat Performance
- **Attack Roll**: Gunner's Int/Dex modifier + Shoot skill
  - -4 penalty vs each fighter
  - One roll per fighter in range
- **Damage Roll**: 3d10 + Int/Dex modifier
- **Effective Against**: Fighter swarms only
- **Special**: Hits all attacking fighters

## Microdrone Specifications
Each drone includes:
- Miniature beam weapon
- Basic AI targeting
- Swarm communication
- Self-destruct failsafe
- 10-minute operational time

## Swarm Mechanics
The cloud operates through:
- Distributed intelligence
- Target prioritization
- Coordinated fire patterns
- Automatic threat response
- Return/recharge protocols

## Defensive Advantages
Smart clouds excel at:
- Protecting blind spots
- Overwhelming fighter defenses
- Forcing range engagement
- Creating no-fly zones

## Comparison to Flak
| Feature | Smart Cloud | Flak Battery |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Damage | 3d10 | 2d6 |
| Targets | All fighters | One fighter |
| Power | 10 | 5 |
| Mass | 5 | 3 |
| Effect | Cloud | Flak bonus |

## Cruiser Defense Doctrine
Smart cloud deployment:
- Activate when fighters close
- Coordinate with point defense
- Preserve drone reserves
- Recall before jump

## Limitations
- Cannot damage frigates or larger
- High power consumption
- Significant mass requirement
- Expensive to maintain
- Drones must be replaced

## Drone Recovery
After engagement:
- 70% typical recovery rate
- 20-minute recharge cycle
- Automated repair systems
- Full reload at dock

## Counter-Fighter Excellence
Against fighter swarms:
- Near-guaranteed kills
- Area saturation
- Morale destroyer
- Forces tactical changes

## Cost Analysis
- Initial: 2 million credits
- Drone replacement: 100k/engagement
- Power infrastructure required
- Specialized maintenance

## Integration Requirements
Ships need:
- Drone launch bays
- Recovery systems
- Command processors
- Power distribution
- Storage capacity

## Historical Development
Created in response to:
- Mass fighter tactics
- Carrier dominance
- Point defense limitations
- Cruiser vulnerabilities

## Fighter Pilot Responses
Counters include:
- Maximum range attacks
- Single pass tactics
- Electronic warfare
- Overwhelming numbers
