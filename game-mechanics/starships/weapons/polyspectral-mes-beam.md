# Polyspectral MES Beam

## Overview
A rare example of pretech weaponry, a fighter equipped with a PMB can scratch even a battleship's hull.

## Statistics
- **Cost**: 2,000,000 credits
- **Damage**: 2d4
- **Power**: 5
- **Mass**: 1
- **Hardpoints**: 1
- **Minimum Class**: Fighter
- **Tech Level**: 5
- **Qualities**: AP 25

## Special Properties

### Armor Penetration (AP 25)
The highest armor penetration available to fighter-class weapons, capable of damaging any ship regardless of armor.

### Pretech Weapon
- Requires TL5 facilities for maintenance
- Replacement parts extremely rare
- Often salvaged from Mandate-era wrecks
- Cannot be manufactured with current technology

## Tactical Usage
- **Primary Role**: Elite fighter anti-capital weapon
- **Best Against**: Any target, including battleships
- **Weakness**: Extremely expensive and rare
- **Strategy**: Precision strikes on critical systems

## Design Notes
The polyspectral MES (Metadimensional Energy Shunt) beam represents the pinnacle of Mandate-era fighter weaponry. Using principles barely understood by modern science, it phases its energy output through multiple dimensional frequencies simultaneously, making armor nearly irrelevant.

## Installation Requirements
- Fighter-class hull or larger
- 5 units of free power
- 1 unit of free mass
- 1 available hardpoint
- TL5 maintenance facilities
- Specialized technicians

## Combat Performance
- **Attack Roll**: Gunner's Int/Dex modifier + Shoot skill
- **Damage Roll**: 2d4 + Int/Dex modifier
- **Effective Against**: All ship classes without exception
- **Fighter Combat**: Can use Pilot skill instead of Shoot

## Rarity and Value
- **Acquisition**: Usually salvaged, not purchased
- **Black Market**: 3-5 million when available
- **Maintenance**: Requires TL5 expertise
- **Cultural Value**: Status symbol among pilots

## Strategic Implications
A fighter squadron equipped with PMBs can:
- Threaten capital ship operations
- Pierce any defensive formation
- Justify extreme defensive measures
- Command premium contracts

## Comparison
- Highest AP of any fighter weapon
- Moderate damage output
- No ammunition requirements
- Pretech maintenance needs

## Historical Context
During the Mandate era:
- Standard equipment on elite interceptors
- Manufactured in specialized forge worlds
- Key to fighter supremacy doctrine
- Technology now largely lost
