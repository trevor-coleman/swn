# Nuclear Missiles

## Overview
Useless in ship-to-ship combat or against any other TL4 planet with working nuke snuffers, one of these missiles can still erase an entire lostworlder city without such protection.

## Statistics
- **Cost**: 50,000 credits (5,000 cr per missile)
- **Damage**: Special
- **Power**: 5
- **Mass**: 1
- **Hardpoints**: 2
- **Minimum Class**: Frigate
- **Tech Level**: 4
- **Qualities**: Ammo 5

## Special Properties

### Special Damage
Nuclear missiles do not function in ship-to-ship combat. Their effects are:
- Instantly neutralized by any TL4 nuke snuffer
- Devastating against unprotected ground targets
- City-killer yield against TL3 or lower civilizations

### Ammo 5
- 5 missiles fit in 1 mass unit
- Each missile costs 5,000 credits
- Weapon includes 1 mass unit (5 missiles) free
- Often restricted or illegal

## Tactical Usage
- **Primary Role**: Terror weapon/planetary bombardment
- **Effective Against**: Primitive worlds only
- **Useless Against**: Any TL4+ target
- **Strategy**: Last resort or war crime

## Technical Details
Nuclear missiles in the post-Scream era:
- Standard fission/fusion warheads
- Yield typically 50-200 megatons
- Guidance systems for surface targets
- Instantly detected by modern sensors

## Why They Don't Work in Space
- TL4 nuke snuffers prevent fission
- Field effect extends kilometers
- Standard on all TL4 ships
- Ground installations even stronger

## Ground Target Effects
Against unprotected targets:
- Complete destruction in 5km radius
- Severe damage to 20km
- Radiation effects lasting
- Electromagnetic pulse effects

## Installation Requirements
- Frigate-class hull or larger
- 5 units of free power
- 1 unit of free mass
- 2 available hardpoints
- Special permits often required
- Secure magazine mandatory

## Legal Status
Nuclear missiles are typically:
- Banned by most civilized worlds
- Restricted to military vessels
- Subject to inspection
- Considered war crimes if misused

## Historical Context
Post-Scream nuclear doctrine:
- Mandate-era snuffers made nukes obsolete
- Only useful against primitive worlds
- Retained for specific scenarios
- Symbol of last resort

## Tactical Scenarios
Legitimate uses include:
- Asteroid redirection
- Rogue AI facility destruction
- Quarantine enforcement
- Certain mining operations

## Comparison to Conventional Weapons
- Cannot damage shielded ships
- Massive collateral damage
- Political consequences
- Limited tactical value

## Storage Requirements
- Radiation-shielded magazine
- Security protocols
- Regular inspection
- Tamper detection

## Deployment Considerations
Before using nuclear missiles:
- Verify target lacks snuffers
- Consider political fallout
- Document justification
- Prepare for consequences

## Alternative Systems
For ship combat, consider:
- [Torpedo Launcher](torpedo-launcher.md)
- [Plasma Beam](plasma-beam.md)
- Any conventional weapon

## Ethical Guidelines
Most naval codes require:
- Warning before deployment
- Civilian evacuation time
- Command authorization
- Post-action reporting

## Detection and Countermeasures
- Launch immediately detected
- 30+ minute flight time to surface
- Interception possible
- Snuffer fields 100% effective

## Why Ships Carry Them
Despite limitations:
- Psychological deterrent
- Mining operations
- Emergency scenarios
- Traditional armament

## Cost Analysis
- Cheap initial investment
- Expensive maintenance
- Political cost enormous
- Limited practical value
