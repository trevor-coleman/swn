# Flak Emitter Battery

## Overview
A baseline frigate anti-fighter system, this battery fires waves of lasers or charged particles to knock down small craft.

## Statistics
- **Cost**: 500,000 credits
- **Damage**: 2d6
- **Power**: 5
- **Mass**: 3
- **Hardpoints**: 1
- **Minimum Class**: Frigate
- **Tech Level**: 4
- **Qualities**: AP 10, Flak

## Special Properties

### Armor Penetration (AP 10)
Ignores 10 points of armor, allowing it to damage even military-grade fighters.

### Flak
Against fighter-class hulls, rolls hit and damage twice, taking the better result.

## Tactical Usage
- **Primary Role**: Frigate fighter defense
- **Best Against**: Fighter swarms
- **Weakness**: Limited use vs capital ships
- **Strategy**: Area denial and fighter suppression

## Design Notes
The flak emitter battery scales up fighter-based sandthrower technology for frigate deployment. Multiple emitter arrays create overlapping fields of fire, generating a lethal defensive envelope around the ship. The system can switch between laser pulses and charged particles based on target profiles.

## Installation Requirements
- Frigate-class hull or larger
- 5 units of free power
- 3 units of free mass
- 1 available hardpoint
- TL4 shipyard facilities

## Combat Performance
- **Attack Roll**: Gunner's Int/Dex modifier + Shoot skill
  - vs Fighters: Roll twice, take better
- **Damage Roll**: 2d6 + Int/Dex modifier
  - vs Fighters: Roll twice, take better
- **Effective Against**: Primarily fighters
- **AP allows**: Penetration of fighter armor

## Battery Configuration
Multiple emitters provide:
- 360-degree coverage
- Overlapping fire zones
- Rapid target switching
- Sustained fire capability

## Comparison to Fighter Weapons
- Higher damage than sandthrower
- Armor penetration capability
- Requires more mass and power
- Frigate-only mounting

## Defensive Doctrine
Standard frigate defense includes:
- Flak batteries for fighter suppression
- Main guns for ship-to-ship
- Coordinated fire patterns
- Fighter launch bays (optional)

## System Integration
Works best with:
- Advanced targeting sensors
- Fighter detection arrays
- Coordinated defense networks
- Point defense augmentation

## Limitations
- Requires frigate hull minimum
- Higher power draw than fighter weapons
- Less effective vs larger ships
- Significant mass requirement
