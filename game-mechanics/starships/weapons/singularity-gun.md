# Singularity Gun

## Overview
One of the few surviving pretech weapons in anything resembling wide currency, this capital-class weapons system fires something mathematically related to a miniaturized black hole at a target.

## Statistics
- **Cost**: 20,000,000 credits
- **Damage**: 5d20
- **Power**: 25
- **Mass**: 10
- **Hardpoints**: 5
- **Minimum Class**: Capital
- **Tech Level**: 5
- **Qualities**: AP 25

## Special Properties

### Armor Penetration (AP 25)
The highest armor penetration of any weapon - gravitational forces ignore conventional defenses.

### Pretech Weapon
- Cannot be manufactured with current technology
- Requires TL5 facilities for maintenance
- Usually salvaged from Mandate-era warships
- Replacement parts nearly impossible to find

### Singularity Generation
Creates a microscopic gravitational anomaly that:
- Exists for nanoseconds
- Causes catastrophic damage
- Warps local space-time
- Defies current physics understanding

## Tactical Usage
- **Primary Role**: Ultimate ship killer
- **Best Against**: Any target
- **Weakness**: Extreme cost and rarity
- **Strategy**: Decisive battle winner

## Design Notes
The singularity gun represents the pinnacle of Mandate-era weapons technology. Using principles that modern science can barely comprehend, it creates what is mathematically similar to a black hole - a gravitational singularity that exists just long enough to tear through any defense. The weapon's operation requires exotic matter and energy manipulations beyond current human understanding.

## Installation Requirements
- Capital-class hull only
- 25 units of free power
- 10 units of free mass
- 5 available hardpoints
- TL5 maintenance capability
- Exotic matter storage
- Specialized technicians

## Combat Performance
- **Attack Roll**: Gunner's Int/Dex modifier + Shoot skill
- **Damage Roll**: 5d20 + Int/Dex modifier
- **Effective Against**: Everything
- **Average Damage**: 50+ points

## Singularity Properties
The weapon creates:
- Micro black hole
- Nanosecond duration
- Gravitational shear
- Space-time distortion
- Cascade destruction

## Power Requirements
Highest of any weapon:
- 25 units continuous
- Exotic matter injection
- Containment field power
- Reality stabilizers

## Damage Scale
Typical results:
- Fighters: Instant vaporization
- Frigates: One-shot kills
- Cruisers: 1-2 shots fatal
- Capitals: Severe damage

## Rarity and Value
- Perhaps 100 exist sector-wide
- Cannot be purchased normally
- Black market: 50+ million
- National treasure level
- Wars fought over them

## Maintenance Nightmare
Requires:
- TL5 trained specialists
- Exotic matter supplies
- Quantum field generators
- Parts that can't be made

## Historical Context
During the Mandate:
- Standard battleship armament
- Mass produced on forge worlds
- Technology now lost
- Each one irreplaceable

## Strategic Impact
A ship with singularity gun:
- Dominates any battle
- Deters all aggression
- Commands respect
- Changes regional balance

## Comparison to All Weapons
| Weapon | Damage | AP | Availability |
|--------|---------|-----|--------------|
| Singularity | 5d20 | 25 | Nearly impossible |
| VTI | 3d20 | 20 | Expensive |
| Mass Cannon | 2d20 | 20 | Costly |

## Operating Hazards
- Containment failure catastrophic
- Exotic matter highly dangerous
- Misfire could destroy ship
- Requires perfect maintenance

## Firing Sequence
Complex process:
1. Exotic matter injection
2. Containment field activation
3. Reality anchor engagement
4. Singularity generation
5. Directional collapse

## Political Implications
Ownership means:
- Regional power status
- Diplomatic leverage
- Military supremacy
- Constant threats

## Technical Mysteries
Modern science cannot explain:
- Singularity containment
- Directional projection
- Duration control
- Safety mechanisms

## Crew Requirements
Operation needs:
- TL5 trained gunners
- Quantum physicists
- Exotic matter specialists
- Mandate-era technicians

## Combat Doctrine
Ships with singularity guns:
- Held in reserve
- Used for decisive battles
- Protected at all costs
- Never risk capture

## Salvage Sources
Found only in:
- Mandate battleship wrecks
- Lost fleet graveyards
- Forgotten weapon caches
- Ancient battle sites

## Future Loss
When they're gone:
- Technology irreplaceable
- Knowledge lost forever
- Power balance shifts
- New doctrine needed

## Cultural Impact
Singularity guns are:
- Legendary weapons
- Objects of worship
- Symbols of lost glory
- Reminders of the fall
