# Mass Cannon

## Overview
By firing projectiles almost as large as fighter-scale craft, the mass cannon inflicts tremendous damage on a target. Serious ammunition limitations hamper its wider-scale use.

## Statistics
- **Cost**: 5,000,000 credits (50,000 cr per round)
- **Damage**: 2d20
- **Power**: 10
- **Mass**: 5
- **Hardpoints**: 4
- **Minimum Class**: Capital
- **Tech Level**: 4
- **Qualities**: AP 20, Ammo 4

## Special Properties

### Armor Penetration (AP 20)
Massive kinetic energy provides exceptional armor penetration against any target.

### Ammo 4
- 4 rounds fit in 1 mass unit
- Each round costs 50,000 credits
- Weapon includes 1 mass unit (4 rounds) free
- Rounds are fighter-sized projectiles

## Tactical Usage
- **Primary Role**: Capital ship siege weapon
- **Best Against**: Large, slow targets
- **Weakness**: Very limited ammunition
- **Strategy**: Make every shot count

## Design Notes
The mass cannon fires projectiles so large they approach the size of small fighter craft. These massive kinetic weapons use magnetic acceleration to achieve velocities that deliver devastating impact energy. Each round is essentially a guided missile the size of a shuttle, making ammunition both expensive and limited.

## Installation Requirements
- Capital-class hull only
- 10 units of free power
- 5 units of free mass
- 4 available hardpoints
- TL4 capital shipyard
- Massive magazine space
- Specialized loading systems

## Combat Performance
- **Attack Roll**: Gunner's Int/Dex modifier + Shoot skill
- **Damage Roll**: 2d20 + Int/Dex modifier
- **Effective Against**: All large ships
- **Ammunition**: Severely limited

## Projectile Specifications
Each round features:
- Fighter-scale mass
- Limited guidance systems
- Armor-piercing design
- Kinetic kill vehicle
- 50,000 credit cost

## Ammunition Management
Critical considerations:
- Base load: 4 rounds only
- Resupply extremely difficult
- Capital berth required for reload
- Strategic weapon deployment

## Damage Potential
Average performance:
- 21 damage per hit
- Penetrates any armor
- Massive kinetic transfer
- Potential instant kills

## Comparison to Energy Weapons
| Weapon | Damage | Ammo | Cost/Shot |
|--------|---------|------|-----------|
| Mass Cannon | 2d20 | 4 | 50,000 |
| VTI | 3d20 | ∞ | 0 |
| Singularity | 5d20 | ∞ | 0 |

## Loading Mechanism
Complex system includes:
- Automated magazines
- Magnetic rails
- Projectile alignment
- Safety interlocks

## Strategic Deployment
Mass cannons best for:
- Opening volleys
- Killing blows
- Psychological warfare
- Siege operations

## Cost Analysis
- Initial: 5 million credits
- Per engagement: 200,000+ credits
- Reload infrastructure needed
- Specialized ammunition supply

## Historical Context
Developed as alternative to:
- Power-hungry energy weapons
- Complex gravitic systems
- Maintenance-heavy options
- Exotic technology needs

## Tactical Doctrine
Standard practice:
- Reserve for critical targets
- Coordinate with fleet
- Document each shot
- Maximize hit probability

## Magazine Design
Storage requires:
- Reinforced hull sections
- Automated handling
- Safety systems
- Quick-load capability

## Projectile Types
Standard loads include:
- Armor piercing (default)
- High explosive variants
- EMP rounds (experimental)
- Breacher rounds

## Limitations
- 4 shots per battle typical
- Cannot manufacture in field
- Massive storage needs
- Expensive to operate

## Psychological Impact
Mass cannon presence:
- Deters aggression
- Forces range respect
- Commands premium contracts
- Intimidation factor high

## Reload Procedures
At capital shipyard:
- 4-hour reload cycle
- Specialized equipment
- Safety protocols
- Cost: 200,000 credits

## Combat Examples
Typical usage:
- Round 1: Cripple cruiser
- Round 2: Finish cruiser
- Rounds 3-4: Reserve or second target
- Rely on other weapons after

## Future Developments
Research areas:
- Improved magazines
- Cheaper ammunition
- Guided projectiles
- Rapid reload systems
