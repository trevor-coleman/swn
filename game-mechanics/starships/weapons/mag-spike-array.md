# Mag Spike Array

## Overview
A storm of magnetically-accelerated spike charges is almost guaranteed to eradicate any fighter-class craft it hits.

## Statistics
- **Cost**: 1,000,000 credits (5,000 cr per volley)
- **Damage**: 2d6+2
- **Power**: 5
- **Mass**: 2
- **Hardpoints**: 2
- **Minimum Class**: Frigate
- **Tech Level**: 4
- **Qualities**: Flak, AP 10, Ammo 5

## Special Properties

### Flak
Against fighter-class hulls, rolls hit and damage twice, taking the better result.

### Armor Penetration (AP 10)
Ignores 10 points of armor, ensuring damage even to military fighters.

### Ammo 5
- Requires spike charge ammunition
- 5 volleys fit in 1 mass unit
- Each volley costs 5,000 credits
- Weapon includes 1 mass unit (5 volleys) free

## Tactical Usage
- **Primary Role**: Elite anti-fighter defense
- **Best Against**: Fighter swarms
- **Weakness**: Expensive ammunition
- **Strategy**: Devastating area denial

## Design Notes
The mag spike array launches clouds of magnetically-accelerated micro-projectiles in precise patterns. Each "spike" is a small, dense penetrator that gains tremendous velocity through sequential magnetic acceleration rings. The weapon combines the area saturation of flak weapons with armor-piercing capability.

## Installation Requirements
- Frigate-class hull or larger
- 5 units of free power
- 2 units of free mass
- 2 available hardpoints
- TL4 shipyard facilities
- Spike charge magazine

## Combat Performance
- **Attack Roll**: Gunner's Int/Dex modifier + Shoot skill
  - vs Fighters: Roll twice, take better
- **Damage Roll**: 2d6+2 + Int/Dex modifier
  - vs Fighters: Roll twice, take better
- **Effective Against**: All fighters, especially swarms
- **Special**: Guaranteed damage modifier

## Spike Charge Technology
Each volley contains:
- Thousands of micro-penetrators
- Magnetic guidance systems
- Proximity detonation option
- Pattern optimization AI

## Ammunition Management
- Base loadout: 5 volleys
- Additional storage: 1 mass = 5 volleys
- Larger hulls double capacity:
  - Cruiser: 10 volleys per mass
  - Capital: 20 volleys per mass
- Rapid reload capability

## Why It's Devastating
The combination of:
- Flak quality (double rolls)
- AP 10 (penetrates armor)
- Bonus damage (+2)
- Area saturation
Makes this the ultimate fighter killer.

## Cost Considerations
- Initial cost: 1 million credits
- Per volley: 5,000 credits
- Most expensive anti-fighter system
- Worth it for high-value protection

## Defensive Networks
Often deployed in:
- Capital ship escorts
- Station defense grids
- Convoy protection
- High-value installations

## Comparison to Other Flak
| Weapon | Damage | AP | Cost/Shot |
|--------|---------|-----|-----------|
| Sandthrower | 2d4 | 0 | 0 |
| Flak Battery | 2d6 | 10 | 0 |
| Mag Spike | 2d6+2 | 10 | 5,000 |

## Fighter Pilot Nightmares
Mag spike arrays are feared because:
- Nearly impossible to dodge
- Penetrates fighter armor
- Consistent high damage
- Creates no-fly zones

## Installation Strategy
Best mounted on:
- Dedicated escort frigates
- Capital ship close defense
- High-value stations
- Fighter base protection

## Historical Impact
Introduction of mag spike arrays changed fighter doctrine, forcing:
- Longer engagement ranges
- Hit-and-run tactics
- Electronic warfare priority
- Heavier fighter armor
