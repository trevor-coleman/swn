# Plasma Beam

## Overview
With superior targeting and a smaller energy drain than a CPC, a plasma beam sacrifices some armor penetration.

## Statistics
- **Cost**: 700,000 credits
- **Damage**: 3d6
- **Power**: 5
- **Mass**: 2
- **Hardpoints**: 2
- **Minimum Class**: Frigate
- **Tech Level**: 4
- **Qualities**: AP 10

## Special Properties

### Armor Penetration (AP 10)
Moderate armor penetration suitable for engaging most frigate-class vessels and lightly armored cruisers.

### No Accuracy Penalties
Unlike the CPC, plasma beams maintain full accuracy against all target sizes.

## Tactical Usage
- **Primary Role**: Versatile frigate main weapon
- **Best Against**: Other frigates
- **Strength**: Balanced performance
- **Strategy**: General-purpose engagement

## Design Notes
The plasma beam generates a coherent stream of superheated plasma contained within a magnetic bottle. The weapon's superior targeting systems and lower power requirements make it a favorite among frigate captains who need reliable, all-around performance.

## Installation Requirements
- Frigate-class hull or larger
- 5 units of free power
- 2 units of free mass
- 2 available hardpoints
- TL4 shipyard facilities

## Combat Performance
- **Attack Roll**: Gunner's Int/Dex modifier + Shoot skill
- **Damage Roll**: 3d6 + Int/Dex modifier
- **Effective Against**: All ship classes
- **No penalties**: Full accuracy vs all targets

## Plasma Generation
The weapon system includes:
- Fusion bottle for plasma generation
- Magnetic containment field
- Coherent beam projection
- Advanced targeting array

## Power Efficiency
Key advantage over CPC:
- Half the power requirement
- More sustainable fire rate
- Less strain on ship systems
- Better heat dissipation

## Comparison Chart
| Feature | Plasma Beam | CPC |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Damage | 3d6 | 3d6 |
| AP | 10 | 15 |
| Power | 5 | 10 |
| Accuracy | Normal | Clumsy |
| Cost | 700k | 800k |

## Tactical Flexibility
The plasma beam excels at:
- Mixed engagement scenarios
- Fighter interception
- Sustained combat
- Power-limited situations

## Installation Trade-offs
- Requires more mass than CPC
- Takes same hardpoint allocation
- Lower power allows other systems
- Better overall efficiency

## Common Configurations
Frigate loadouts often feature:
- Twin plasma beams (main battery)
- Point defense systems
- Adequate power reserves
- Balanced offense/defense

## Maintenance
- Standard TL4 maintenance protocols
- Plasma bottle replacement every 1000 hours
- Magnetic coil calibration monthly
- Lower overall maintenance than CPC

## Combat Doctrine
Best practices include:
- Engage at medium range
- Focus fire with other plasma beams
- Use accuracy advantage vs fighters
- Sustain fire longer than CPC ships

## Historical Development
Created as alternative to the power-hungry CPC, plasma beams became the standard armament for patrol frigates needing extended operational endurance.
