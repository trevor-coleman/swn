# Charged Particle Caster

## Overview
A focalized upgrade to the reaper battery, the CPC has a much better armor penetration profile.

## Statistics
- **Cost**: 800,000 credits
- **Damage**: 3d6
- **Power**: 10
- **Mass**: 1
- **Hardpoints**: 2
- **Minimum Class**: Frigate
- **Tech Level**: 4
- **Qualities**: AP 15, Clumsy

## Special Properties

### Armor Penetration (AP 15)
Ignores 15 points of target armor, allowing effective engagement of cruiser-class vessels.

### Clumsy
- Suffers -4 to hit fighter-class hulls
- Due to slower discharge time and targeting requirements
- Best used against larger, slower targets

## Tactical Usage
- **Primary Role**: Anti-cruiser frigate weapon
- **Best Against**: Frigates and light cruisers
- **Weakness**: Poor accuracy vs fighters
- **Strategy**: Mid-range ship engagement

## Design Notes
The charged particle caster represents an evolution of the reaper battery technology, focusing the particle stream through magnetic confinement fields for increased penetration. While this focusing improves armor penetration significantly, it makes the weapon less effective against small, agile targets.

## Installation Requirements
- Frigate-class hull or larger
- 10 units of free power
- 1 unit of free mass
- 2 available hardpoints
- TL4 shipyard facilities

## Combat Performance
- **Attack Roll**: Gunner's Int/Dex modifier + Shoot skill
  - -4 penalty vs fighter-class hulls
- **Damage Roll**: 3d6 + Int/Dex modifier
- **Effective Against**: Frigate and cruiser hulls
- **Range**: Standard ship engagement range

## Power Requirements
The CPC requires significant power to maintain particle acceleration and magnetic confinement:
- Double the power of standard reaper battery
- Brief power spikes during firing
- May require power management on smaller frigates

## Comparison to Reaper Battery
- **Advantages**: Better armor penetration, higher damage
- **Disadvantages**: Requires 2 hardpoints, double power, clumsy
- **Use Case**: When facing armored opponents

## Frigate Doctrine
Standard frigate loadouts often include:
- 1 CPC for ship-to-ship combat
- Point defense for fighter protection
- Balance of power and mass allocation

## Targeting Limitations
The Clumsy quality results from:
- Longer charge cycle
- Narrow firing arc
- Predictable particle stream
- Difficulty tracking fast targets

## Cost Analysis
- 8x more expensive than reaper battery
- Requires significant power infrastructure
- Best for dedicated warships
- Poor choice for multi-role vessels

## Historical Context
Developed during the post-Scream rebuilding as navies needed weapons capable of threatening increasingly armored warships without the expense of capital-class hulls.
