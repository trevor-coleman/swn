# Ship Acquisition and Construction

## Sector Development Levels

### Advanced Sectors
Different sectors have different degrees of development. In some regions of space, starships have been manufactured for centuries, with small spacecraft easily obtained by private individuals and modest companies. These sectors have:

- Regular commerce between worlds
- Interstellar drills no more remarkable than modern air travel
- Aliens and offworlder humans noticed but unremarked
- Relatively large stellar polities made up of numerous member stars
- Shared general culture or political forms
- May still have backward planets or unknown worlds (as exceptions)

**Price Adjustment**: In advanced sectors, ship prices should be **halved or quartered** from standard rates.

### Standard Sectors (Most Common)
In most Stars Without Number sectors, development is more limited:

- Some worlds have functional shipyards and interstellar flight
- Starship ownership is still rare
- Entire planetary navies might have fewer than a dozen ships
- Only powerful worlds have cruisers or heavy warships
- Enough commercial traffic to justify starports and trade stations
- Free and easy transit between worlds lost for centuries, slowly returning
- Rich in adventure potential - unknown neighbors and lost worlds
- No world strong enough to exert will carelessly around distant stars

## Acquiring Starships

### Civilian Ships
**Where**: Available on any TL4 world  
**Types**: Almost exclusively fighter or frigate-class hulls:
- Free merchants (most common)
- In-system shuttles
- Bulk freighter hulls (on wealthy worlds only)

**Armament**: Ships may be armed to the extent the buyer's purse allows, but they are no match for real warships. Most planets don't worry about civilian armed merchants.

**Warning**: Conspicuous acquisition of numerous armed merchants might draw unwelcome interest.

### Military Hulls
**Restriction**: Rarely permitted to civilian buyers
- Even lowly patrol boats are usually off-limits
- Fleet cruisers and ships of the line almost never available
- Crewing requirements often beyond adventuring party resources

**Exceptions**: Heroes who make the right friends or do favors for planetary governments can sometimes get **letters of marque** that entitle them to purchase normally restricted hulls.

### Alternative Acquisition Methods
**Liberation**: Many adventurers find it more efficient to liberate craft from undeserving owners through:
- Daring deeds and cunning subterfuge
- Salvage operations
- **Note**: Craft acquired this way are rarely in perfect condition

## Naval Forces by World Type

### Poor World Navy
- 1 corvette
- 6 patrol boats

### Average TL4 Planet Navy  
- 1 fleet cruiser
- 4 corvettes or heavy frigates
- 10 patrol boats

### Rich Planet Navy
- 3× average numbers
- Possibly 1 battleship or carrier as fleet heart

**Operational Status**: One-third of all ships are usually in dock at any given time.

## Piracy Threat Assessment

### Ideal Pirate System
Pirates need specific conditions to operate effectively:
- Low-tech primitive world (for raiding slaves and supplies)
- Hidden or mobile deep-space repair base for maintenance
- Two or more wealthy neighboring systems sending trade through
- Weak system governments unable to coordinate response

### Pirate Operations by Scale
**Small Ships**: 
- Hide in asteroid belts
- Strike merchants from ambush
- Flee to safer systems before help arrives

**Large Flotillas**:
- Existential threat to planetary navies
- Soon dispersed or become effective system masters
- Achieve space supremacy by destroying opposing ships

**Naval Deterrent**: Very few pirates operate in systems with strong naval presence.

## Ship Building Process

### Step 1: Choose Hull Type
Pick from the available hull types, which determines:
- Base hull price (includes drive-1 spike drive)
- Available free power and mass
- Crew requirements and capabilities

### Step 2: Add Components
Install fittings, weapons, and defenses:
- Each addition consumes power and mass
- May have minimum hull size requirements
- Larger ships pay more for some components (marked with * or #)

### Step 3: Determine Crew
**Merchant Ships**: Usually run with no more than 2× minimum crew (save wages)  
**Warships**: Rarely leave port with less than 75% maximum crew

**Crew Costs**:
- 100 credits/day in wages per crew member
- +20 credits/day for food and stores per crew member
- PCs don't charge themselves wages but still need food

### Step 4: Calculate Maintenance
**Six-Month Maintenance Cost**: 5% of total non-crew ship cost

**Penalty for Skipped Maintenance**: -1 to all skill checks and hit rolls per missed period

### Step 5: Complete Ship Record
Fill in ship statistics and attack bonuses for gunners using ship's weapons.

## Construction Speed and Costs

### Standard Shipyard Work
- **Base Rate**: 25,000 credits/day of work or modifications
- **Rush Jobs**: Can double or quadruple rate with sufficient reason
- **Political Importance**: Affects priority and speed

### Safety Requirements
**Minimum Crew for Safe Drill**: 3 crew members required

**Solo Operation**: Theoretically possible for lone crewman to make successful spike drill, but requires:
- Heavy pharmaceuticals for constant vigilance
- Great desperation
- Significant risk

## Hull Design Philosophy

### Size Relationships
Each hull class is usually 4-8 times larger than the class before it:
- Size varies by sector's technological sophistication
- Resource availability affects construction scale
- Regional variations in typical ship sizes

### Damage Resistance
**Immunity**: Ships ignore damage from:
- Small arms
- TL3 Heavy weapons

**TL4 Heavy Weapons**: Do half damage minus ship's Armor when applied to exterior

**Interior Sabotage**: TL4 Heavy weapons inside ship do half damage but ignore Armor

**Caution**: Use of Heavy weapons in confined areas may be imprudent

## Cost Multipliers

### Fittings Marked with *
- **Frigate**: ×10 base cost
- **Cruiser**: ×25 base cost  
- **Capital**: ×100 base cost

### Power/Mass Marked with #
- **Frigate**: ×2 base requirement
- **Cruiser**: ×3 base requirement
- **Capital**: ×4 base requirement

**Note**: Multipliers apply even if fitting only works on large ships (e.g., frigate with Drill Course Regulator pays 250,000 credits, not 25,000).
