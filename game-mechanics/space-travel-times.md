# Space Travel Times

## Spike Drive Travel (Between Systems)

- **Base travel time**: 6 days per hex on the sector map
- **Drill margin**: -1 day per drive rating (minimum 1 day/hex)
- **Example**: Drive-2 ship = 4 days/hex, Drive-3 = 3 days/hex

## In-System Travel

- **Between planets/stations**: 24-48 hours typically
- **To outer system**: Up to 6 days
- **Combat/pursuit speed**: Minutes to hours

## Important Notes

- Spike drives only work between star systems (not in-system)
- In-system uses conventional drives (fusion torches, etc.)
- Refueling required after jumps (usually at gas giants or stations)
- Navigation skill checks needed for spike jumps
