CHARACTER CREATION
Before you can begin playing Stars Without Number,
you need to roll up a character. While the game can
theoretically work with just a single player and a GM,
things work best with 2–5 friends in addition to the
GM. A lone adventurer can get in a lot of trouble out
there, and a small group can find it hard to include all
the different skills and talents that are often required
to survive a sticky situation.
With that in mind, you and the others in your
gaming group should give a little thought to making
characters that work well together. Grim loners make
good book protagonists, but they don’t survive well
when there’s no author around to bail them out.
When making a character, some players like to
simply throw the dice and see where they lead. Others
prefer to know a little more about the game world and
like to have more detail provided beforehand about the
worlds and themes of the game. For those who’d prefer
a more detailed discussion of the world of Stars Without
Number, you can skip ahead to page 120 and read up on
it there. For the rest of you…

What Players Need To Know

Your character is an adventurer in the year 3200, a
dweller among the scattered worlds of a great human
diaspora. For whatever reason, he or she has decided
to leave their old life behind and take up a starfaring
existence, daring perils and seeking new frontiers in
search of glory, riches, or their own personal ambitions.
Many worlds have recovered from the desperation of the centuries-long Silence, and can once again
manufacture spacecraft and other advanced technology.
Other worlds are “lost worlds”, still cut off from interstellar trade and forced to make do with the resources
of their own planet. Lostworlders are often considered
barbaric by technologically advanced worlds.
Tramp freighters, small merchant ships, and scout
craft serve most worlds, even the most backward. If
your character comes from a primitive or isolated culture, it’s probable that he or she hitched a ride aboard
such a ship to travel to a more cosmopolitan life. It may
or may not have been a voluntary choice.
In actual play, your character should be motivated
to act, and to act as part of a group. The game does
not deal well with hostile loners, apathetic brooders, or
other characters that have to be coaxed into engaging
with the world and cooperating with the rest of the
group. The world of Stars Without Number is dangerous, and characters who cringe from peril or insist on
facing it alone will find only boredom or an early grave.
Every character should have a goal from the very
start. This might be something as simple as “become
wealthy beyond my fondest dreams of avarice” or “be
known as the greatest pilot in the sector”. It might be
as elaborate as “engineer the downfall of the interstellar

empire that conquered my world”. Whatever it is, it
should give your character an immediate reason to go
out and do something.
This will to act is especially crucial in Stars Without Number, because this game is designed to support
a “sandbox” style of gaming. Unlike many other games
that encourage the development of a particular story
or the playing out of a specific plot line, Stars Without
Number presents an entire interstellar sector to your
characters and invites you to choose for yourself how
to experience it. Stories will arise based on what your
characters do and how they respond to the adventure
situations provided by the GM.
As a player, you need to cooperate with your GM.
This doesn’t necessarily mean following every lead and
hook you’re given without demurral, but it does mean
that you need to respond to the situations and possibilities that are given to you.
You also need to keep in mind that your adventurers exist in a very large world that is not scaled to
your characters’ abilities. If you insist on throwing your
characters into situations or challenges that seem overwhelming, the odds are that they will overwhelm you.
Scouting, reconnaissance, and careful intelligence gathering will help you recognize no-win situations before
you push ahead into them. By the same token, don’t
hesitate to flee if your party appears to be facing certain
doom. A keen sense of when to decamp the field is
often an experienced adventurer’s most valuable asset.

Rolling a Character
Stars Without Number belongs to a somewhat older
tradition in tabletop RPGs, one where characters
aren’t so much “built” as they are “rolled”. Players
often don’t know who exactly they’re going to be
playing in a campaign, and rely on random rolls to
determine a hero’s aptitudes and skills. Part of the
pleasure of the game is throwing these new-rolled
cyphers into play and exploring their personalities
and motivations directly through the events of the
adventures they undertake.
In most modern games, however, a player
expects to be able to create exactly the kind of PC
they’ve envisioned before the campaign begins.
They don’t want to rely on random rolls to give
them the character they’re going to be playing.
This is a perfectly valid preference, and players who want to have full control over creating
their hero can do so with an attribute array and
skills picked from a selected background. Even
so, players without strong feelings on the matter
might find it refreshing to let their hero’s past be
discovered by the unpredictable chance of the dice.

4• SUMMARY OF CHARACTER CREATION

A SUMMARY OF CHARACTER CREATION
For your convenience, here’s a quick summary of the
character creation process. Experienced players can
simply go down the list to generate their next interstellar freebooter, while those new to the game can use it as
a guide reference as they go through the steps detailed
on the following pages. A blank character sheet can be
found at the end of the book.
Note that some steps indicate that you should roll
or pick skills, as described on page 7. The first time you
roll or pick a skill, it starts at level-0. The second time,
it becomes level-1. The third time, you can instead pick
any other non-psychic skill of your choice that’s less
than level-1. No novice hero’s skills can exceed level-1
during character creation.
1.

Roll your six attributes or assign them from an
array, using Strength, Dexterity, Constitution,
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Attributes
reflect the basic potential of your hero. Roll 3d6
six times and assign them in order, or use an
array of 14, 12, 11, 10, 9, 7 assigned as you wish.
If you randomly roll your scores you may then
pick one attribute to change to a score of 14.

2.

Mark down your attribute modifiers for each
score. When rolling dice that are affected by an
attribute, you don’t apply the whole score; instead, you apply the attribute modifier. A score
of 3 is a -2, 4—7 is a -1, 8—13 is no modifier,
14—17 is +1, and 18 is +2.

3.

Pick a background from the list on page 9, one
that most closely reflects your hero’s past experiences. You gain the skill listed under the
background name at level-0, which equates to
an ordinary working knowledge of it.

4.

Decide whether to roll for additional skills or
pick them. If you pick skills, you can choose two
more skills from the Learning table for your
background, with the exception of entries that
say “Any Skill”, which you may not pick. You
cannot pick entries from the Growth table. If
you’re not sure what to pick, just take the “Quick
Skills” listed for your background at level-0,
which include your background’s beginning skill.

5.

If you choose to roll for your skills, you can roll up
to three times, dividing up your rolls between
the Growth and Learning tables as you wish.
When you roll on the Growth table, some results may say “+2 Physical” or “+2 Mental”. In
the former case, you can add two points to either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution, or one
point to two different stats. In the latter case,

you can add two points to either Intelligence,
Wisdom, or Charisma, or divide the bonus between two of them.
6.

Choose your class, representing those talents
you have that are most relevant to an adventurer’s lifestyle. If your hero isn’t well-described
by Warrior, Expert, or Psychic, you can choose
Adventurer and mix your class abilities.

7.

Choose your foci, representing the side talents
or particular specializations of your hero. You
can pick one level of a focus of your choice.
Characters with the Expert class or the Partial
Expert feature of the Adventurer class get one
level of a non-combat, non-psychic focus for
free in addition to this. They can spend both
levels on the same focus, starting with level 2
in it if they wish. Characters with the Warrior
class or Partial Warrior feature of the Adventurer class can do the same in choosing one level of
a combat focus.

8.

Optionally, if your GM is allowing alien PCs or
VI or True AI PCs, you can make your character
into one such creature by spending your focus
level on the appropriate origin focus. Aliens and
VIs are described in the Xenobestiary chapter,
starting on page 192, while True AIs are part
of the deluxe Stars Without Number core book,
starting on page 280.

9.

Now pick one non-psychic skill of your choice to
reflect your hero’s outside interests, natural talents, hobby expertise, or other personal focus.

10.

If you’ve chosen the Psychic class or chosen to be
an Adventurer with the Partial Psychic ability,
you are a psychic PC, with powers described
in the following section, starting on page 28.
Psychics can pick two psychic skills from those
listed on page 8, while Partial Psychics can pick
one. If a Psychic picks the same skill twice, they
get it at level-1 expertise, and can pick a free
level-1 technique from those listed for that discipline. Both Psychics and Partial Psychics get
the level-0 abilities associated with their skills,
as described under each discipline they possess.
Both also have a maximum Effort score equal to
1 plus their highest psychic skill plus the better of
their Wisdom or Constitution modifiers.

11.

Roll your maximum hit points on 1d6, adding
your Constitution modifier. Even a penalty can’t
reduce your hit points below 1. Warrior PCs

Record your Armor Class, the measure of how

order to hurt your PC, an enemy has to roll an
attack roll on a d20, adding their attack bonus
and equaling or exceeding your Armor Class.

17.

Note down your beginning saving throw scores
for your Physical, Evasion, and Mental saving
throws. Physical saves against poison, disease,
or exhaustion are 15 minus the best of your
Strength or Constitution modifiers. Evasion
saves to dodge sudden perils or dive away from
explosives are 15 minus the best of your Intelligence and Dexterity modifiers. Mental saves to
resist psychic influence or mind-bending technology are 15 minus the best of your Wisdom or
Charisma modifiers. To resist these perils, you
need to equal or beat the save on a d20.

18.

Lastly, wrap up your PC with a name and a goal.
Every hero needs to have a goal when they set
out adventuring. This goal might change, but
your PC should always have some reason to go
out and interact with the world before them.
Stay-at-home PCs and those unwilling to dare
greatly for their aims are rarely fun to play.

6• ATTRIBUTES

ATTRIBUTES
The first step in creating a character is to determine
the character’s six attributes. Attributes describe how
strong, quick, clever, perceptive, hardy, or charming
your hero might be. Attributes are measured by scores
ranging from 3 to 18, with 3 reflecting an attribute
so weak that the PC is barely fit for adventuring and
an 18 marking the maximum possible aptitude for an
ordinary human.
To generate a character’s attributes, roll 3d6 six
times and assign the results in order to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. You may then change one attribute of your choice
to 14 if you wish to ensure that your new adventurer
is gifted in at least one way.
If you prefer not to roll, you may instead assign
the following scores to your attributes in any order you
wish: 14, 12, 11, 10, 9, and 7. If you assign your scores,
you cannot replace one of them with a 14.
Once you’ve assigned your attributes, record the
modifier for each of them. This modifier is applied to
relevant skill checks or other rolls related to the attribute. If your attribute score changes during play, either from some crippling injury or from improvements
granted by your background or experience, you should
make sure to update any changed modifier.

Rolling a PC’s Attributes
Simon’s rolling up a character for a new campaign.
The first step is to figure out what kind of hero he’s
going to be playing in the upcoming game, and that
means determining attributes.
If Simon had a particular concept he knew he
wanted to play, choosing to use the array might be
a good idea. It provides a predictable set of numbers
he can put in whatever order he wishes, and unless
his concept requires that his PC be particularly gifted
in more than one attribute, the 14 that’s part of the
array would ensure that he was capable in whatever
natural aptitude was most important to the concept.
On the other hand, even if he rolls the dice, he
knows his hero is going to be good at something. He
can put that free 14 in any attribute he wishes, so if
all he cares about is making sure his PC is quick, he
can rest assured that random rolling will still produce a quick PC.
Simon, however, really doesn’t have any particular concept he knows he wants to play for this campaign. He decides he’s going to let the dice determine
what kind of hero he’s going to play. Letting the dice
make the decision helps him break out of any ruts he
might be in when it comes to character concepts, and
it can make him consider ideas that might be fresher
in play than his usual fare.

Simon takes three six-sided dice in hand and
rolls them six times, assigning each number in order
to his Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence,
Wisdom, and Charisma scores. His results are 10, 4,
13, 16, 8, and 7.
Since 10 or 11 is an average human score, Simon
can see that this PC has a very considerable intellect counterbalanced by pronounced clumsiness and
poor social skills. Because he rolled his statistics, he
can replace one of the rolls with a score of 14. After
some consideration, Simon decides that swapping
out his bad Dexterity score makes the most sense.
Now Simon notes down the attribute modifiers for each of his scores: a Strength of 10 is +0, a
Dexterity of 14 is +1, a Constitution of 13 is +0, an
Intelligence of 16 is +1, a Wisdom of 8 is +0, and a
Charisma of 7 is -1.
When rolling skill checks, attack rolls, or other
things modified by an attribute, Simon will be using
the modifier rather than the full attribute score. The
scores themselves might change a little due to his
hero’s background or future personal training, but
mostly they’ll serve as cues for playing the PC. With
a Wisdom of 8, for example, Simon’s hero might not
have a penalty to rolls, but he probably makes the
occasional decision he lives to regret.

SKILLS •7

SKILLS
Your hero’s learned capabilities are skills, and every
star-faring adventurer has their share of them. A hero
can usually attempt to do anything, whether it’s to
climb a sun-scorched cliff on an alien world, talk down
an enraged lostworlder warlord, or fire a mag rifle at
a charging xenomorph, but having the right skill can
make a vast difference in results.
Skills are measured in a rating from level-0 for
competent practitioners to level-4 for the best in the
sector. Novice heroes start with level-0 or level-1 in
their skills. You’ll choose or roll skills in the next section, when you select a background for your character.
Skill Level
Level-0

Basic competence in the skill, such as
an ordinary practitioner would have

Level-1

An experienced professional in the
skill, clearly better than most

Level-2

Veteran expert, one respected even
by those with considerable experience

Level-3

Master of the skill, likely one of the
best on the planet

Level-4

Superlative expertise, one of the best
in the entire stellar sector.

Skill Checks

Your hero is assumed to be competent at all the ordinary functions of their role and background. If he’s a
moisture farmer from a back-of-nowhere desert world,
he’s going to know how to keep a dew still running and
how to put on a coolsuit. If she’s a corporate magnate’s
succession-groomed daughter from a megacorp-dominated hiveworld, she’s going to know how to read a
balance sheet and speak during a meeting with C-level
executives. They will never fail at these basic tasks unless some situation makes them much harder than usual.
Sometimes, however, the hero will be faced with
a situation outside their usual experience, or will try
to accomplish a normal task while under considerable
strain or disadvantage. In those cases, you’ll need to
roll a skill check.
To roll a skill check, roll 2d6 and add the most
applicable attribute modifier and skill level. If the total
is equal or greater than the difficulty of the check, you
succeed. If less, something goes wrong, or you fail outright in the attempt, or something unexpected happens.
If you haven’t even got level-0 in the relevant skill
you take a -1 penalty to the roll. Some particularly technical or difficult feats might not be achievable at all
without some grounding in the skill.

8• ATTRIBUTES

The Skill List

The following skills are standard choices for most campaigns. Games set in unusual reaches of space or unique
settings might alter this list.
Skills are general, and some of them may overlap
in some situations. A hero trying to clear a jammed disruptor cannon before the aliens break through the door
might plausibly check either Fix to repair it or Shoot to
represent their familiarity with weapons maintenance.
Assuming the GM agrees, you can roll whichever skill
is better for you.
Administer: Manage an organization, handle paperwork, analyze records, and keep an institution
functioning on a daily basis. Roll it for bureaucratic expertise, organizational management, legal knowledge, dealing with government agencies,
and understanding how institutions really work.
Connect: Find people who can be helpful to your purposes and get them to cooperate with you. Roll
it to make useful connections with others, find
people you know, know where to get illicit goods
and services, and be familiar with foreign cultures
and languages. You can use it in place of Talk for
persuading people you find via this skill.
Exert: Apply trained speed, strength, or stamina in
some feat of physical exertion. Roll it to run, jump,
lift, swim, climb, throw, and so forth. You can use
it as a combat skill when throwing things, though
it doesn’t qualify as a combat skill for other ends.
Fix: Create and repair devices both simple and complex.
How complex will depend on your character’s
background; a lostworlder blacksmith is going to
need some study time before he’s ready to fix that
broken fusion reactor, though he can do it eventually. Roll it to fix things, build things, and identify
what something is supposed to do.
Heal: Employ medical and psychological treatment for
the injured or disturbed. Roll it to cure diseases,
stabilize the critically injured, treat psychological
disorders, or diagnose illnesses.
Know: Know facts about academic or scientific fields.
Roll it to understand planetary ecologies, remember relevant history, solve science mysteries, and
know the basic facts about rare or esoteric topics.
Lead: Convince others to also do whatever it is you’re
trying to do. Talk might persuade them that following you is smart, but Lead can make them do
it even when they think it’s a bad idea. Roll it to
lead troops in combat, convince others to follow
you, or maintain morale and discipline.
Notice: Spot anomalies or interesting facts about your
environment. Roll it for searching places, detecting ambushes, spotting things, and reading the
emotional state of other people.
Perform: Exhibit some performative skill. Roll it to
dance, sing, orate, act, or otherwise put on a convincing or emotionally moving performance.

Pilot: Use this skill to pilot vehicles or ride beasts. Roll
it to fly spaceships, drive vehicles, ride animals,
or tend to basic vehicle repair. This skill doesn’t
help you with things entirely outside the scope
of your background or experience, though with
some practice a PC can expand their expertise.
Program: Operating or hacking computing and communications hardware. Roll it to program or hack
computers, control computer-operated hardware,
operate communications tech, or decrypt things.
Punch: Use it as a combat skill when fighting unarmed.
If your PC means to make a habit of this rather
than as a recourse of desperation, you should take
the Unarmed Combatant focus described later.
Shoot: Use it as a combat skill when using ranged weaponry, whether hurled rocks, bows, laser pistols,
combat rifles, or ship’s gunnery.
Sneak: Move without drawing notice. Roll it for stealth,
disguise, infiltration, manual legerdemain, pickpocketing, and the defeat of security measures.
Stab: Use it as a combat skill when wielding melee
weapons, whether primitive or complex.
Survive: Obtain the basics of food, water, and shelter
in hostile environments, along with avoiding their
natural perils. Roll it to handle animals, navigate
difficult terrain, scrounge urban resources, make
basic tools, and avoid wild beasts or gangs.
Talk: Convince other people of the facts you want them
to believe. What they do with that conviction may
not be completely predictable. Roll it to persuade,
charm, or deceive others in conversation.
Trade: Find what you need on the market and sell what
you have. Roll it to sell or buy things, figure out
where to purchase hard-to-get or illicit goods, deal
with customs agents, or run a business.
Work: This is a catch-all skill for professions not represented by other skills. Roll it to work at a particular
profession, art, or trade.

Psychic Skills

Unlike other skills, psychic skills are restricted to characters with the Psychic class or the Partial Psychic class
option for Adventurers. You cannot choose or roll
these skills in character creation unless specifically told
to pick a psychic skill.
Biopsionics: Master powers of physical repair, body augmentation, and shapeshifting.
Metapsionics: Master powers that nullify, boost, and
shape the use of other psychic abilities.
Precognition: Master the ability to sense future events
and control probability.
Telekinesis: Master the remote control of kinetic energy
to move objects and fabricate force constructs.
Telepathy: Master the reading and influencing of other
sapient minds.
Teleportation: Master the arts of physical translocation
of yourself and allies.

BACKGROUNDS •9

CHOOSING A BACKGROUND
It’s unlikely that your character sprang forth full-grown
from the endless depths of space, so it’s probable that he
or she had some sort of background before adventuring
and some kind of training in a field suitable for the life
of an interstellar wayfarer. Of course, the call of adventure is somewhat indiscriminate, and some people from
very unlikely walks of life might find themselves hurled
into the potentially-lethal excitement of deep space. To
determine your hero’s past training, you need to choose
or roll a background.
A background is simply a thumbnail description
of the kind of life your hero lived before they took up
adventuring. It may not have been the only thing they
did with their life, but it’s the thing that taught them
most of their existing skills.
When you’ve chosen or rolled your background,
take a moment to think about your character’s past.
Decide how your character came to take up that profession, and what made them put it down to follow a
more adventurous lifestyle. Did they do it for excitement? Friendship? Money? Or were they just running
from a situation they couldn’t handle?
You will also want to pick a homeworld for your
PC. Your GM can give you some suggestions for worlds
in their campaign that would fit your character concept,
or you might simply make up your own homeworld or
native space habitat with the GM’s permission, as you
might be from some far-distant sector of space.
Twenty backgrounds are provided on the following pages. You may roll randomly to see where your
hero comes from, or pick one that suits you. If none of
the backgrounds appeal to you, you can simply describe
your hero’s prior life to the GM and pick any three
skills that fit that past.

Training Skills and Attributes

When your character is allowed to pick or roll a skill,
you learn it at level-0 expertise the first time you receive it. If you receive it a second time, it becomes level-1. If some mechanic or skill choice allows or obliges
you to pick it a third time, you can instead choose any
non-psychic skill in its place. The only way to raise
psychic skills during character creation is via special
abilities or foci that specifically boost them. No starting
character can begin with a skill level higher than level-1.
Sometimes you’re allowed to pick “Any Skill”. This
means you can choose any non-psychic skill to improve.
Other entries that read “Any Combat” mean that you
can pick either Stab, Shoot, or Punch as you choose.
You cannot raise psychic skills with “Any Skill” picks.
Rolls on the Growth table that improve your basic
attributes can boost them up to a maximum of 18. A
bonus that applies to “Any Stat” can be applied to any
attribute. If the roll says to add the bonus to Physical attributes, you can add the bonus to either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. If the roll says to add a bonus
to your Mental attributes, you can apply the points to
either Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. If the bonus
is +2, you may split the points between two different
attributes of the appropriate type if you wish.

Backgrounds, Skills, and Growth

Once you pick a background, your hero gains several
skills associated with their past.
First, you get the free skill associated with the
background. Every member of that role or profession
needs this skill to function competently, so your hero
gets it as well.
Next, you may either pick two other skills from
the Learning table for your background, or make three
random rolls divided between the Growth and Learning tables. If you pick skills, you can select exactly the
talents you want for your hero, while going with random rolls allows your character a little wider range of
competence and the option of attribute improvements
at the cost of perfect control over their development. If
you pick skills, you may pick the same skill twice if you
wish, to improve its starting proficiency.
If you’re not sure what to pick, just take the three

10• BACKGROUNDS

Barbarian

Standards of barbarism vary when many worlds
are capable of interstellar spaceflight, but your
hero comes from a savage world of low technology
and high violence. Their planet may have survived
an all-consuming war, or been deprived of critical
materials or energy resources, or simply have been
colonized by confirmed Luddites. Other barbarians
might be drawn from the impoverished underclass
of advanced worlds or the technologically-degenerate inheritors of some high-tech space station or
planetary hab.

Clergy

Faith is nigh-universal among human civilizations,
and your hero is dedicated to one such belief. Some
clergy are conventional priests or priestesses, while
others might be cloistered monastics or nuns, or
more martial warrior-monks. Modern-day faiths
such as Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism,
Buddhism, and other creeds all exist in various sectors, often in altered form, while some worlds have
developed entirely new deities or faiths. If you’d like
to create your own religion, you can work with the
GM to define its characteristic beliefs.

Building a Background for a PC
Simon’s got his hero’s attributes set, but those are just
part of making a character. He also needs to figure
out where this hero came from, and what kind of
life they’ve led before they took up the mantle of an
adventuring existence.
If he had a particular preference for a background, he could simply pick one of the list on page
9. If none of those fit, he could just write down a
few sentences about the background he did want and
pick three skills that fit it, assuming the GM agreed
it made sense, or rolled on the existing background
tables that best fit their custom past. But Simon is
still uncertain about the nature of his hero, so he
decides to roll randomly for a background.
He gets a 15, so his hero is a scholar. As a scholar,
he automatically gets the Know skill at level-0, and
needs to decide what kind of scholar he is. Simon
considers his options and decides to go with something he knows; his PC is a literature post-doc by the
name of Basil Hayes.
Simon decides that Basil should continue with
his random rolling rather than just choosing two
more skills from the Learning table for a scholar.
Because he chooses to randomly roll, he can make
three rolls, splitting them as he wishes between the
Learning or the Growth table.

His first roll is on the Growth table, and it
comes up “+2 Mental”. He immediately puts it into
Intelligence, raising the score to 18 and giving it a +2
modifier instead of +1. Basil is a brilliant man.
His second roll he makes on the Learning table,
and it comes up “Know”. He already has Know at
level-0, so now he gets Know-1. His third roll comes
up “Talk”, giving him Talk-0.
A brief view of Basil’s history shows him as a
brilliant young scholar with a keenly refined mind,
an excellent grasp of intellectual topics, and enough
glibness to get through a thesis defense. Simon decides that Basil’s occasional fits of social ineptitude
have torpedoed his career in academia, however, and
have forced him out into the world to make a living
as an interstellar freebooter.
Simon also needs to pick a homeworld for Basil.
While he could ask the GM for a list of likely places,
he decides that Basil hails from the cold and inhospitable world of Karelia, a planet that relies mostly on
trading the long-duty service contracts of its citizens
to other, wealthier worlds in exchange for vital tech.
The GM thinks that Karelia sounds like the sort of
world that would fit in the campaign, and so allows
it. Simon can make up any other details of the world
that are needed as the campaign plays out.

BACKGROUNDS •11

Courtesan

Your hero’s career was one of proffered pleasure.
Simple prostitution is one form of this background,
perhaps as an ordinary streetwalker, a part-time
amateur with bills to pay, or an expensive companion to the wealthy, but other forms of satisfaction exist among the many worlds. Refined artists
of conversation and grace command high fees in
some societies, while others pay well for the simple company of certain men and women with the
right bloodlines, special appearance, or auspicious
personal qualities esteemed by their culture.

Criminal

Whether thief, murderer, forger, smuggler, spy, or
some other variety of malefactor, your hero was a
criminal. Some such rogues are guilty only of crossing some oppressive government or offending a
planetary lord, while others have done things that
no civilized society could tolerate. Still, their ability
to deal with the most desperate and dangerous of
contacts and navigate the perils of a less-than-legal
adventure can make them attractive associates for a
party of freebooters bent on profit and glory more
than strict legality.

Dilettante

Your hero never had a profession, strictly speaking,
but spent their formative years in travel, socializing,
and a series of engaging hobbies. They might have
been the scion of a wealthy industrialist, a planetary
noble’s younger offspring, or a hanger-on to someone with the money and influence they lacked. By
the time your hero’s adventures start, they’ve run
through the money that once fueled their lifestyle.
Extreme measures may be necessary to acquire further funding.

Entertainer

Singers, dancers, actors, poets, writers… the interstellar reaches teem with artists of unnumbered
styles and mediums, some of which are only physically possible with advanced technological support.
Your hero was a dedicated entertainer, one likely
focused in a particular form of art. Patrons and
talent scouts can be temperamental, however, and
sometimes a budding artist needs to take steps to
find their audience. Or at least, to find their audience’s money.

Merchant

Your hero was or is a trader. Some merchants are
mere peddlers and shopkeepers on primitive, lowtech worlds, while others are daring far traders
who venture to distant worlds to bring home their
alien treasures. The nature of trade varies widely
among worlds. On some of them, it’s a business of
soberly-dressed men and women ticking off trades
on virtual terminals, while on others it is a more…
active pursuit, requiring the judicious application of
monoblades and deniable gunfire against competitors. Sometimes a deal goes bad or capital needs
to be raised, and a merchant’s natural talents are
turned toward the perils of adventure.

Noble

Many planets are ruled by a class of nobles, and your
hero was a member of one such exalted group. Such
planets are often worlds of exquisite courtesy alloyed with utterly remorseless violence, and a misplaced word at the morning levee can result in an
executioner’s monoblade at noon. Your hero has
done something or been the victim of something to
dislodge them from their comfortable place at court.
Without their familiar allies, wealth, or influence,
they must take a new place in the world, however
distasteful that claiming might be.

Official

Most advanced worlds run on their bureaucracies, the legions of faceless men and women who
fill unnumbered roles in keeping the government
running as it should. Your hero was one such official. Some were law enforcement officers, others
government office clerks or tax officials or trade
inspectors. However necessary the work may be,
it is often of unendurably tedious nature, and any
man or woman with an adventurous spark to their
blood will soon find themselves desperate for more
exciting use of their talents.

Peasant

A technologically-advanced world can usually produce all its necessary foodstuffs and basic resources
with a handful of workers, the bulk of the labor being performed by agricultural bots. On more primitive worlds, or those with a natural environment
that requires close personal attention to crops, a
class of peasants will emerge. These men and women often become chattel, part and parcel of the land
they occupy and traded among their betters like the
farm equipment of richer worlds. Your hero was
not satisfied with that life, and has done something
to break free from their muddy and toilsome past.

Physician

Bodies wear and break, even on worlds that possess the full resources of advanced postech medicine.
Your hero was a physician, one trained to cure the
maladies of the body or the afflictions of the mind.
Some physicians are conventional health workers,
while others are ship’s surgeons, military medics,
missionary healers of an expanding faith, or dubious slum doctors who’ll graft over laser burns with
no awkward questions asked. Wherever men and
women go into danger, however, the skills of a physician are eagerly sought.

Pilot

A pilot’s role is a broad one in the far future. The
most glamorous and talented navigate starships
through the metadimensional storms of interstellar
space, while less admired figures fly the innumerable intra-system shuttles and atmosphere craft that
serve in most advanced systems. On other worlds,
this career might reflect a long-haul trucker, or a
horse-riding messenger, or an intrepid sailor on an
alien sea. As the Pilot skill covers all these modes
of transport, any character whose role revolves
around vehicles or riding beasts might justify their
selection of this career.

Politician

The nature of a political career varies from world
to world. On some, it’s much like one we’d recognize, with glad-handing voters, loud rallies, and
quiet back room deals with supposed rivals in
government. On others, it might involve a great
deal more ceremonial combat, appeals to councils
of elders, and success at ritual trials. Whatever the
details, your hero was a politician in their home
culture. Something went wrong, though, and the
only way to fix it is to get clear of your constituents for a while and seek some alternative means
of advancement.

expertise of a metadimensional structures engineer
or the sacred memorization of the chronicles of
some lostworlder sage-order, but your hero’s life
was in learning. Sometimes that learning cannot be
found in familiar surroundings, however, and for
one reason or another, willing or not, your hero
must venture out into the wider world.

was a professional fighter, whether that took the
form of a barbarian noble’s thegn, a faceless conscript in a planetary army, or an elite soldier in the
service of a megacorp’s private military. Whether it
was because they were on the losing side, choosing
to leave the service, or being forced to flee a cause
they couldn’t fight for, they now find themselves
navigating a world where their most salable skill
is one that can cause them a great deal of trouble.

life outside of natural gravity. It’s not uncommon
for such workers to find better prospects in places
where they can breathe without a vacc suit.

these same talents can be turned toward less licit
ends, and a skilled technician’s expertise is always

anything more sophisticated than a sharpened stick.

CHARACTER CLASSES
In one way or another, your character is cut out for
adventure. Your hero might be a veteran combatant,
skilled with blade or laser, or they might be a psychic
gifted with uncanny abilities. It’s just as possible that
they could have remarkable talents as a pilot, or be
the smoothest grifter in the hive-slum they grew up
in. Whatever their particular background, your hero’s
primary focus is their class.
Your class represents your hero’s best set of tools
for dealing with their problems. They’re the skills and
capabilities that they’re most likely to turn to to resolve
a problem, but not their only tools. A Psychic can still
shoot a gun and a Warrior can try to fast-talk a mark.
Choosing a class helps ensure that your hero is
good at something that might contribute to a bold party
of interstellar adventurers. Experts always have a knack
at exercising non-combat skills, Warriors are always
good in a scrap, and Psychics always have a unique
power or two to employ at need. Your hero might have
led a quiet life as a starport customs clerk until recently,
but their natural talents will ensure that they can do
something that the rest of the group will find useful.
In the same vein, you don’t have to choose a class
that “naturally” fits with your background. That starport customs clerk might have led a peaceful life un-

troubled by anything worse than portside brawls, but
inside her burns a seething, latent fury that is ready to
explode at the first opportunity. She’s a Warrior, even
though she might not realize her talents until the first
time she snatches up a dropped laser rifle and unleashes
a barrage of death on a pack of alien warbeasts. You
should pick whatever class for your hero that matches
the kind of play you want to have with them.
There are four possible classes you can choose for
your hero: Adventurer, Expert, Psychic, and Warrior.
Experts are PCs that rely on non-combat skills such as
stealth, persuasion, technical expertise, piloting skills,
vast learning, or personal connections. Psychics are
those rare men and women affected by Metadimensional Extroversion Syndrome, ones capable of channeling these metadimensional energies to perform
feats of telekinesis, precognition, telepathy, and other
psionic disciplines. Warriors are hardened combatants,
skilled in the arts of war and violent conflict, and Adventurers include those with a mix of talents and abilities, ones who don’t fit well into one of the other classes.
Choose a class that best fits your character’s concept. If Expert, Psychic, or Warrior don’t fit your image
of your hero, or if you want to customize their abilities,
you can choose the Adventurer class.

CHARACTER CLASSES •17

EXPERT
Your hero is exceptionally good at a useful skill. Doctors, cat burglars, starship pilots, grifters, technicians,
or any other concept that focuses on expertise in a
non-combat skill should pick the Expert class. Experts
are the best at such skills and gain more of them than
other classes do.
Just as a Warrior can be relied upon to make a
shot when the chips are down, an Expert has a knack
for succeeding at the moments of greatest importance.
Once per scene, an Expert can reroll a failed skill check,
taking the new result if it’s better. This benefit can be
applied to any skill check, even those that the Expert
isn’t specially focused in. Their natural talent bleeds
over into everything they do.
In their chosen field, however, the Expert is exceptionally gifted. Aside from the free focus level that all
PCs get at the start of the game, an Expert can choose
an additional level in a non-combat focus related to
their background. They can spend both of these levels
on the same focus if they wish, thus starting the game
with level 2 in that particular knack.

Class Abilities

Every Expert PC has certain special abilities.
•

You gain a free level in a non-combat focus related to your background. Most concepts will take
Specialist in their main skill, though Diplomat, Starfarer, Healer, or some other focus might suit better.
You may not take a combat-oriented focus with
this perk. In case of uncertainty, the GM decides
whether or not a focus is permitted.

•

Once per scene, you can reroll a failed skill check,
taking the new roll if it’s better.

•

When you advance an experience level, you
gain a bonus skill point that can be spent on any
non-combat, non-psychic skill. You can save this
point to spend later if you wish.

Hit Points and Attack Bonus

To get your starting maximum hit points, roll 1d6 and
add your Constitution modifier, to a minimum of 1 hit
point. Your attack bonus is equal to half your character
level, rounded down, so it’s +0 at first level.

PSYCHIC
Your hero has received training in controlling their natural Metadimensional Extroversion Syndrome, and can
wield the psychic powers that come from that strange
affliction. Controlling and developing psychic abilities
is an extremely demanding process but allows for feats
wholly impossible to ordinary men and women.
Psychics are extremely rare in the general population. Averages vary with worlds, but most range from
one in ten thousand to one in a hundred thousand who
have the MES condition that make them amenable to
psychic training. Some of these go their entire lives
without realizing their capabilities. Others end up exploiting their native abilities without training, almost
inevitably ending up seriously brain-damaged or crazed
by the effects of unmediated metadimensional energy.
Your hero has been fortunate enough to find a psychic academy or other training institution capable of
molding and directing these abilities. They may have
come to this later in life, or been recruited young by a
society that carefully watches for MES symptoms.
Some societies deal with their psychics more generously than others. On some worlds, psychic powers
are accepted and their possessors can look forward to
lucrative and respected employment. On others, fear of
these uncanny powers and memories of the horrors of
the Scream lead to less welcoming treatment.

Class Abilities

Every Psychic PC has certain special abilities.
•

Unlike Warriors or Experts, you are capable of
learning psychic disciplines and their associated
techniques, as described starting on page 28.

•

When you pick this class, choose any two psychic
skills as bonus skills. You can pick the same one
twice to obtain level-1 proficiency in it and a free
level-1 technique from that discipline.

•

You have an Effort score, which can be used to
fuel psychic abilities. Your maximum Effort is
equal to 1 plus your highest psychic skill plus the
better of your Wisdom or Constitution modifiers. Even with a penalty, your maximum Effort
cannot be lower than 1.

Hit Points and Attack Bonus

To get your starting maximum hit points, roll 1d6 and
add your Constitution modifier, to a minimum of 1 hit
point. Your attack bonus is equal to half your character
level, rounded down, so it’s +0 at first level.

18• CHARACTER CLASSES

WARRIOR
Whether a hiveworld thug, barbarian lostworlder,
gengineered combat hominid, or a natural-born killer wasting their potential in a desk job, your hero has
a real talent for inflicting mayhem. Combat in Stars
Without Number is extremely dangerous, but your hero
has the talents to survive situations that would kill a
less martial adventurer.
As a gifted purveyor of violence, you get to pick
an extra combat-related focus associated with your
special brand of havoc. While a character of any class
can take these special combat talents, you get this additional pick and a better natural hit bonus than heroes
of other classes.
Most importantly, however, Warriors have an uncanny gift for making a shot when a hit is desperately
needed, or dodging a bullet when their life is on the
line. Once per scene, a Warrior can either automatically negate a successful combat hit they just received,
taking no damage from it, or else they can turn one
of their own missed attack rolls into an automatic hit.
This versatility makes Warriors exceptionally dangerous enemies in a one-on-one fight, and significantly
more likely to survive the gory chaos of a general melee.

Class Abilities

Every Warrior PC has certain special abilities.
•

You gain a free level in a combat-related focus associated with your background. The GM decides
if a focus qualifies if it’s an ambiguous case.

•

Warriors are lucky in combat. Once per scene, as
an Instant ability, you can either choose to negate a successful attack roll against you or turn a
missed attack roll you made into a successful hit.
You can use this ability after the dice are rolled,
but it cannot be used against environmental damage, effects without an attack roll, or hits on a
vehicle you’re occupying.

•

You gain two extra maximum hit points at each
character level.

Hit Points and Attack Bonus

To get your starting maximum hit points, roll 1d6+2
and add your Constitution modifier, to a minimum of
1 hit point. Your attack bonus is equal to your character
level so it is +1 at first level.

ADVENTURER
The Adventurer class is the catch-all for heroes who
don’t fit so neatly into the other three categories. Perhaps your mercenary spent her girlhood at a psychic
academy, or maybe your combat medic knows more
about using a laser rifle than most physicians do. You
can use the Adventurer class to customize your hero’s
abilities, trading focus for wider versatility.
Adventurers split their focus between different
spheres, gaining weaker versions of each class’ benefits. For example, an Adventurer who is a psionic
warrior-adept might have considerable powers of
telekinetic force and a brutal expertise at bare-handed
combat, but they won’t have access to the wider psionic
potential of an unrestricted Psychic or the death-defying combat luck of a hardened Warrior.
To define your Adventurer’s abilities, pick two of
the following three partial classes.

Partial Expert

You gain a free level in a non-combat focus related to
your background. Most concepts will take Specialist,
though Diplomat, Starfarer, Healer, or some other focus
might suit better. Gain an extra skill point every time
you gain a character level which can be spent on any
non-psychic, non-combat skill.

Partial Psychic

You are a restricted psychic. Pick one psychic discipline
as a bonus skill at level-0. You can improve this skill
with foci or skill points gained from advancing a level,
but you cannot learn or improve any other psychic skill.
Your maximum Effort equals 1 plus this psychic skill’s
level plus the best of your Wisdom or Constitution
modifiers, down to a minimum of 1.

Partial Warrior

You gain a free level in a combat focus related to your
background. Gain +1 to your attack bonus at first and
fifth levels. Gain 2 extra maximum hit points each level.
Thus, at first level, you’d roll 1d6+2 for your maximum
hit points. At second, you’d roll 2d6+4, and so forth.

Hit Points and Attack Bonus

To get your starting maximum hit points, roll 1d6 and
add your Constitution modifier, to a minimum of 1 hit
point. Adventurers who’ve taken the Partial Warrior
option add 2 hit points to their maximum.
The base attack bonus for Adventurers is equal to
half their character level, rounded down, so +0 at first
level. If the PC has taken the Partial Warrior option
their class bonus increases this to +1 at first level.

FOCI •19

CHOOSING A FOCUS
Every member of a class has certain baseline abilities
that let them do well at their role. Warriors are always
good combatants, Experts are always gifted with their
skills, and Psychics always have a few pertinent psionic
abilities. Aside from these baseline abilities, characters
also have a focus.
A focus is an additional knack, perk, or aptitude
that a hero has, one that grants them certain benefits
in play. Each focus has one or more levels of increasingly-strong effect. For example, someone with level
1 in the Die Hard focus gains two extra maximum hit
points each level and automatically stabilizes after a
mortal wound, while someone with level 2 can negate
the first injury they suffer each day that would incapacitate or kill them. The benefits of a focus stack, so
if you take level 2 in one, you get all the benefits from
level 1 as well.
Any character can pick any focus, and it doesn’t
have to “match” the class you selected. A Psychic can
choose the Unarmed Combatant focus for fistic prowess, while a Warrior might have enough experience
with battlefield trauma to qualify as a Healer. The only
obligation is that you explain how your hero picked
up the training or exhibited their natural aptitude for
the focus.
Many foci give a bonus level in a skill as part of
their level 1 benefits. These bonus levels work like any
other skill pick; they either give you the skill at level-0, raise an existing level-0 skill to level-1, or let you
pick any other non-psychic skill if the skill is already
at level-1.
Unless indicated otherwise a focus can be taken
only once. Once you’ve taken level 1 of Die Hard, you
can’t pick it again to get an additional two hit points per
level. Some skill-oriented foci allow you to pick them
more than once to apply to different skills.
Beginning PCs can pick one level of focus. PCs
with the Expert class or the Partial Expert Adventurer class option can choose an additional level in any
non-combat focus related to their background, including level 2 in their initial choice. Most will choose
Specialist, Healer, Diplomat, or some other similar focus,
but the GM can allow other non-combat foci. PCs with
the Warrior class or the Partial Warrior Adventurer
class option can do the same in choosing an additional
combat-related focus.
As your hero advances in experience, you’ll get the
opportunity to pick up new foci or improve existing
ones as you refine your talents or learn new tricks. In
some cases, you might work with the GM to come up
with a custom focus reflecting your PC’s specific special
talent or a perk that makes sense given their recent
adventures. Foci are an important part of a hero’s character, and they should always reflect something basic
about how they tend to interact with the world.

Origin Foci

If you include aliens or robots in your campaign, you
can represent them with origin foci. Origin foci are
taken the same way as any other foci, and may be purchased with a beginning character’s focus level.
If a GM is feeling generous, they can allow a PC
to take a level in an origin focus as well as their usual
free focus level, in order to allow a hero to start as an
alien with some additional knack. A PC who takes this
option doesn’t get their usual bonus focus at level 2;
they’ve already spent it on being unusual.
Origin foci for robotic VIs are on page 199. Available alien races will vary with the campaign setting, but
details on making these race are on page 209.

Choosing A Class and Focus
Basil Hayes needs a class. While an obvious pick
would be Expert to match his background, Simon
decides it would be more amusing to make him a
soldier; specifically, the sniper “Basilisk” Hayes, the
dire-eyed wraith of the cold Karelian forest. Given
the complete lack of a market for his PhD and his
own natural poor judgment, Basil signed up with
a Karelian mercenary outfit. He’s just gotten out
of his tour of duty, but at least now his skills are
significantly more marketable.
While Simon could go with the Adventurer
class for Basil and make him a Partial Warrior/
Partial Expert, he decides to make Basil a fullfledged Warrior. His intellectual talents can be
useful, but Basil’s main utility to the group is his
ability to deal with combat situations.
Every PC gets to pick one focus of any kind,
and a Warrior gets to pick one combat-related
focus. Basil’s first choice is easy, as clearly he’s a
Sniper, so he writes that down as a level 1 focus.
Rather than taking a second level in that with his
other pick, Simon decides to have Basil pick up
a level of the Gunslinger focus. Basil will get the
chance to pick more foci as he gains experience.
Each of these foci grant a bonus level in Shoot,
so they stack together to give the young sniper a
Shoot-1 skill. Basil’s now as deft with a rifle as he
is with 19th century Terran Victorian poetry.
Lastly, Basil gets to pick any single non-psychic skill of his choice as a hobby or natural talent.
He decides that a sniper isn’t much of a sniper
without being hard to spot, so picks Sneak-0 as his
skill. This free skill pick is often useful for filling in
the necessary talents of a concept that aren’t supplied by the Learning table or bonus skills granted
by a hero’s foci.

20• FOCI

THE FOCUS LIST
Alert

You are keenly aware of your surroundings and virtually impossible to take unaware. You have an instinctive
alacrity of response that helps you act before less wary
persons can think to move.
Level 1: Gain Notice as a bonus skill. You cannot be
surprised, nor can others use the Execution Attack
option on you. When you roll initiative, roll twice
and take the best result.
Level 2: You always act first in a combat round unless
someone else involved is also this Alert.

Armsman

You have an unusual competence with thrown weapons and melee attacks. This focus’ benefits do not apply
to unarmed attacks or projectile weapons. For thrown
weapons, you can’t use the benefits of the Armsman
focus at the same time as Gunslinger.
Level 1: Gain Stab as a bonus skill. You can draw or
sheath a Stowed melee or thrown weapon as an
Instant action. You may add your Stab skill level to
a melee or thrown weapon’s damage roll or Shock
damage, assuming it has any to begin with.
Level 2: Your primitive melee and thrown weapons
count as TL4 weapons for the purpose of overcoming advanced armors. Even on a miss with a
melee weapon, you do an unmodified 1d4 damage
to the target, plus any Shock damage. This bonus
damage doesn’t apply to thrown weapons or attacks that use the Punch skill.

Assassin

You are practiced at sudden murder, and have certain
advantages in carrying out an Execution Attack as described in the rules on page 52.
Level 1: Gain Sneak as a bonus skill. You can conceal an
object no larger than a knife or pistol from anything less invasive than a strip search, including
normal TL4 weapon detection devices. You can
draw or produce this object as an On Turn action,
and your point-blank ranged attacks made from
surprise with it cannot miss the target.
Level 2: You can take a Move action on the same round
as you make an Execution Attack, closing rapidly
with a target before you attack. You may split this
Move action when making an Execution Attack,
taking part of it before you murder your target
and part of it afterwards. This movement happens
too quickly to alert a victim or to be hindered by
bodyguards, barring an actual physical wall of
meat between you and your prey.

Authority

You have an uncanny kind of charisma about you, one
that makes others instinctively follow your instructions
and further your causes. At level 1, this is a knack of
charm and personal magnetism, while level 2 might
suggest latent telepathic influence or transhuman memetic hacking augmentations. Where this focus refers
to followers, it means NPCs who have voluntarily chosen to be in your service. PCs never count as followers.
Level 1: Gain Lead as a bonus skill. Once per day, you
can make a request from an NPC who is not openly hostile to you, rolling a Cha/Lead skill check at
a difficulty of the NPC’s Morale score. If you succeed, they will comply with the request, provided
it is not harmful or extremely uncharacteristic.
Level 2: Those who follow you are fired with confidence. Any NPC being directly led by you gains a
Morale and hit roll bonus equal to your Lead skill
and a +1 bonus on all skill checks. Your followers
will not act against your interests unless under
extreme pressure.

Close Combatant

You’ve had all too much practice at close-in fighting
and desperate struggles with pistol or blade. You’re extremely skilled at avoiding injury in melee combat, and
at level 2 you can dodge through a melee scrum without
fear of being knifed in passing.
Level 1: Gain any combat skill as a bonus skill. You can
use pistol-sized ranged weapons in melee without suffering penalties for the proximity of melee
attackers. You ignore Shock damage from melee
assailants, even if you’re unarmored at the time.
Level 2: The Shock damage from your melee attacks
treats all targets as if they were AC 10. The Fighting Withdrawal combat action is treated as an On
Turn action for you and can be performed freely.

Connected

You’re remarkably gifted at making friends and forging
ties with the people around you. Wherever you go, you
always seem to know somebody useful to your ends.
Level 1: Gain Connect as a bonus skill. If you’ve spent
at least a week in a not-entirely-hostile location,
you’ll have built a web of contacts willing to do
favors for you that are no more than mildly illegal.
You can call on one favor per game day and the
GM decides how far they’ll go for you.
Level 2: Once per game session, if it’s not entirely implausible, you meet someone you know who is
willing to do modest favors for you. You can decide when and where you want to meet this person, but the GM decides who they are and what
they can do for you.

FOCI •21

Die Hard

You are surprisingly hard to kill. You can survive injuries or bear up under stresses that would incapacitate a
less determined hero.
Level 1: You gain an extra 2 maximum hit points per
level. This bonus applies retroactively if you take
this focus after first level. You automatically stabilize if mortally wounded by anything smaller than
a Heavy weapon.
Level 2: The first time each day that you are reduced to
zero hit points by an injury, you instead survive
with one hit point remaining. This ability can’t
save you from Heavy weapons or similar trauma.

Diplomat

You know how to get your way in personal negotiations, and can manipulate the attitudes of those around
you. Even so, while smooth words are versatile, they’ll
only work if your interlocutor is actually willing to
listen to you.
Level 1: Gain Talk as a bonus skill. You speak all the languages common to the sector and can learn new
ones to a workable level in a week, becoming fluent in a month. Reroll 1s on any skill check dice
related to negotiation or diplomacy.
Level 2: Once per game session, shift an intelligent
NPC’s reaction roll one step closer to friendly if
you can talk to them for at least thirty seconds.

Gunslinger

You have a gift with a gun. While this talent most commonly applies to slugthrowers or energy weapons, it
is also applicable to thrown weapons, bows, or other
ranged weapons that can be used with the Shoot skill.
For thrown weapons, you can’t use the benefits of the
Armsman focus at the same time as Gunslinger.
Level 1: Gain Shoot as a bonus skill. You can draw or
holster a Stowed ranged weapon as an On Turn
action. You may add your Shoot skill level to a
ranged weapon’s damage roll.
Level 2: Once per round, you can reload a ranged weapon as an On Turn action if it takes no more than
one round to reload. Even on a miss with a Shoot
attack, you do an unmodified 1d4 damage.

Hacker

You have a considerable fluency with digital security
measures and standard encryption methods. You know
how to make computerized systems obey you until
their automatic failsafes come down on your control.
Level 1: Gain Program as a bonus skill. When attempting to hack a database or computerized system,
roll 3d6 on the skill check and drop the lowest die.
Level 2: Your hack duration increases to 1d4+Program
skill x 10 minutes. You have an instinctive understanding of the tech; you never need to learn the
data protocols for a strange system and are always
treated as familiar with it.

Healer

Healing comes naturally to you, and you’re particularly
gifted at preventing the quick bleed-out of wounded
allies and comrades.
Level 1: Gain Heal as a bonus skill. You may attempt to
stabilize one mortally-wounded adjacent person
per round as an On Turn action. When rolling
Heal skill checks, roll 3d6 and drop the lowest die.
Level 2: Stims or other technological healing devices
applied by you heal twice as many hit points as
normal. Using only basic medical supplies, you
can heal 1d6+Heal skill hit points of damage to
every injured or wounded person in your group
with ten minutes of first aid spread among them.
Such healing can be applied to a given target only
once per day.

Henchkeeper

You have an distinct knack for picking up lost souls
who willingly do your bidding. You might induce them
with promises of money, power, excitement, sex, or
some other prize that you may or may not eventually
grant. A henchman obtained with this focus will serve
in loyal fashion until clearly betrayed or placed in unacceptable danger. Henchmen are not “important” people
in their society, and are usually marginal sorts, outcasts,
the desperate, or other persons with few options.
You can use more conventional pay or inducements to acquire additional henchmen, but these extra
hirelings are no more loyal or competent than your pay
and treatment can purchase.
Level 1: Gain Lead as a bonus skill. You can acquire
henchmen within 24 hours of arriving in a community, assuming anyone is suitable hench material. These henchmen will not fight except to save
their own lives, but will escort you on adventures
and risk great danger to help you. Most henchmen will be treated as Peaceful Humans from the
Xenobestiary section of the book. You can have
one henchmen at a time for every three character levels you have, rounded up. You can release
henchmen with no hard feelings at any plausible
time and pick them back up later should you be
without a current henchman.
Level 2: Your henchmen are remarkably loyal and
determined, and will fight for you against anything but clearly overwhelming odds. Whether
through natural competence or their devotion
to you, they’re treated as Martial Humans from
the Xenobestiary section. You can make faithful
henchmen out of skilled and highly-capable NPCs,
but this requires that you actually have done them
some favor or help that would reasonably earn
such fierce loyalty.

22• FOCI

Ironhide

Whether through uncanny reflexes, remarkable luck,
gengineered skin fibers, or subtle telekinetic shielding,
you have natural defenses equivalent to high-quality
combat armor. The benefits of this focus don’t stack
with armor, though Dexterity or shield modifiers apply.
Level 1: You have an innate Armor Class of 15 plus half
your character level, rounded up.
Level 2: Your abilities are so effective that they render
you immune to unarmed attacks or primitive
weaponry as if you wore powered armor.

Psychic Training

You’ve had special training in a particular psychic discipline. You must be a Psychic or have taken the Partial
Psychic class option as an Adventurer to pick this focus.
In the latter case, you can only take training in the discipline you initially chose as a Partial Psychic. As with
most foci, this focus can be taken only once.
Level 1: Gain any psychic skill as a bonus. If this improves it to level-1 proficiency, choose a free level-1 technique from that discipline. Your maximum Effort increases by one.
Level 2: When you advance a level, the bonus psychic
skill you chose for the first level of the focus automatically gets one skill point put toward increasing it or purchasing a technique from it. You may
save these points for later, if more are required to
raise the skill or buy a particular technique. These
points are awarded retroactively if you take this
focus level later in the game.

Savage Fray

You are a whirlwind of bloody havoc in melee combat,
and can survive being surrounded far better than most
combatants.
Level 1: Gain Stab as a bonus skill. All enemies adjacent
to you at the end of your turn whom you have not
attacked suffer the Shock damage of your weapon
if their Armor Class is not too high to be affected.
Level 2: After suffering your first melee hit in a round,
any further melee attacks from other assailants automatically miss you. If the attacker who hits you
has multiple attacks, they may attempt all of them,
but other foes around you simply miss.

Shocking Assault

You’re extremely dangerous to enemies around you.
The ferocity of your melee attacks stresses and distracts
enemies even when your blows don’t draw blood.
Level 1: Gain Punch or Stab as a bonus skill. The Shock
damage of your weapon treats all targets as if they
were AC 10, assuming your weapon is capable of
harming the target in the first place.
Level 2: In addition, you gain a +2 bonus to the Shock
damage rating of all melee weapons and unarmed
attacks. Regular hits never do less damage than
this Shock would do on a miss.

Sniper

You are an expert at placing a bullet or beam on an
unsuspecting target. These special benefits only apply
when making an Execution Attack with a firearm or
bow, as described on page 52.
Level 1: Gain Shoot as a bonus skill. When making
a skill check for an Execution Attack or target
shooting, roll 3d6 and drop the lowest die.
Level 2: A target hit by your Execution Attack takes a
-4 penalty on the Physical saving throw to avoid
immediate mortal injury. Even if the save is successful, the target takes double the normal damage
inflicted by the attack.

Specialist

You are remarkably talented at a particular skill. Whether a marvelous cat burglar, a world-famous athlete, a
brilliant engineer, or some other savant, your expertise
is extremely reliable. You may take this focus more than
once for different skills.
Level 1: Gain a non-combat, non-psychic skill as a bonus.
Roll 3d6 and drop the lowest die for all skill checks
in this skill.
Level 2: Roll 4d6 and drop the two lowest dice for all
skill checks in this skill.

Star Captain

You have a tremendous natural talent for ship combat,
and can make any starship you captain a significantly
more fearsome opponent. You must take the captain’s
role during a fight as described on page 117 of the Ship
Combat rules in order to benefit from this focus.
Level 1: Gain Lead as a bonus skill. Your ship gains 2
extra Command Points at the start of each turn.
Level 2: A ship you captain gains bonus hit points equal
to 20% of its maximum at the start of each combat. Damage is taken from these bonus points first,
and they vanish at the end of the fight and do not
require repairs to replenish before the next. In addition, once per engagement, you may resolve a
Crisis as an Instant action by explaining how your
leadership resolves the problem.

Starfarer

You are an expert in the plotting and execution of interstellar spike drills. While most experienced pilots can
manage conventional drills along well-charted spike
routes, you have the knack for forging new drill paths
and cutting courses too dangerous for lesser navigators.
Level 1: Gain Pilot as a bonus skill. You automatically
succeed at all spike drill-related skill checks of difficulty 10 or less.
Level 2: Double your Pilot skill for all spike drill-related skill checks. Spike drives of ships you navigate
are treated as one level higher; thus, a drive-1 is
treated as a drive-2, up to a maximum of drive-7.
Spike drills you personally oversee take only half
the time they would otherwise require.

FOCI •23

Tinker

You have a natural knack for modifying and improving
equipment, as given in the rules on page 90.
Level 1: Gain Fix as a bonus skill. Your Maintenance
score is doubled, allowing you to maintain twice
as many mods. Both ship and gear mods cost only
half their usual price in credits, though pretech
salvage requirements remain the same.
Level 2: Your Fix skill is treated as one level higher for
purposes of building and maintaining mods and
calculating your Maintenance score. Advanced
mods require one fewer pretech salvage part to
make, down to a minimum of zero.

Unarmed Combatant

Your empty hands are more dangerous than knives
and guns in the grip of the less gifted. Your unarmed
attacks are counted as melee weapons when it comes to
binding up opponents wielding rifles and similar long
arms, though you need at least one hand free to do so.
Level 1: Gain Punch as a bonus skill. Your unarmed
attacks become more dangerous as your Punch
skill increases. At level-0, they do 1d6 damage. At
level-1, they do 1d8 damage. At level-2 they do
1d10, level-3 does 1d12, and level-4 does 1d12+1.
At Punch-1 or better, they have the Shock quality
equal to your Punch skill against AC 15 or less.
While you normally add your Punch skill level to
any unarmed damage, don’t add it twice to this
Shock damage.
Level 2: You know locks and twists that use powered
servos against their wearer. Your unarmed attacks
count as TL4 weapons for the purpose of overcoming advanced armors. Even on a miss with a
Punch attack, you do an unmodified 1d6 damage.

Unique Gift

Whether due to exotic technological augmentation, a
unique transhuman background, or a remarkable human talent, you have the ability to do something that’s
simply impossible for a normal human.
This is a special focus which serves as a catch-all
for some novel power or background perk that doesn’t
have a convenient fit in the existing rules. A transhuman who can function normally in lethal environments,
a nanotech-laden experimental subject with a head full
of exotic sensors, or a brilliant gravitic scientist who
can fly thanks to their personal tech might all take this
focus to cover their special abilities.
It’s up to the GM to decide what’s reasonable and
fair to be covered under this gift. If an ability is particularly powerful, it might require the user to take System
Strain to use it, as described on page 32.
As a general rule this ability should be better than
a piece of gear the PC could buy for credits. The player
is spending a very limited resource when they make
this focus pick, so what they get should be good enough
that they can’t just duplicate it with a fat bank account.

Wanderer

Your hero gets around. As part of a life on the road,
they’ve mastered a number of tricks for ensuring their
mobility and surviving the inevitable difficulties of a
vagabond existence.
Level 1: Gain Survive as a bonus skill. You can convey
basic ideas in all the common languages of the
sector. You can always find free transport to a desired destination for yourself and a small group of
your friends provided any traffic goes to the place.
Finding this transport takes no more than an hour,
but it may not be a strictly legitimate means of
travel and may require working passage.
Level 2: You can forge, scrounge, or snag travel papers
and identification for the party with 1d6 hours
of work. These papers and permits will stand up
to ordinary scrutiny, but require an opposed Int/
Administer versus Wis/Notice check if examined
by an official while the PC is actually wanted by
the state for some crime. When finding transport
for the party, the transportation always makes the
trip at least as fast as a dedicated charter would.

Wild Psychic Talent

Some men and women are born with a very limited
form of MES, the mental condition that allows for the
use of psychic powers. While these people are not true
psychics, these “wild talents” can create one limited psychic effect. Training is not always required to develop
this ability, and their MES is so mild that they don’t
suffer the risk of madness or brain damage that more
developed psychics risk should they use their powers
without proper training.
Wild talents are not treated as psychics for general purposes and cannot “torch” their powers. When
relevant, they are treated as having one point of Effort.
Psychics and Partial Psychics cannot take this focus.
Level 1: Pick a psychic discipline. You gain an ability
equivalent to the level-0 core power of that discipline. Optionally, you may instead pick a level-1
technique from that discipline, but that technique must stand alone; you can’t pick one that
augments another technique or core ability. For
example, you could pick the Telekinetic Armory
technique from Telekinesis, because that ability
does not require the use of any other Telekinesis power. You could not pick the Mastered Succor
ability from Biopsionics, because that technique is
meant to augment another power you don’t have.
Level 2: You now have a maximum Effort of two points.
You may pick a second ability according to the
guidelines above. This second does not need to be
a stand-alone technique if it augments the power
you chose for level 1 of this focus. Thus, if your
first pick was gaining the level-0 power of Psychic
Succor, your second could be Mastered Succor. You
still could not get the level-1 core power of Psychic
Succor, however, as you’re still restricted to level-0.

24• FINAL TOUCHES

FINAL TOUCHES
You’re almost finished. Just a few more things to note
down, and you’ll have an adventurer ready for play.
First, pick one more non-psychic skill of your
choice. This pick represents your hobbies, your side
interests, or some well of natural talent. You gain it at
level-0 if you don’t already have it. Otherwise, it stacks
to increase the skill to level-1. You can’t pick a skill you
already have at level-1.
Next, determine your maximum hit points. Your
hit points are a measure of how close you are to death
or defeat; when you run out of them, your character is
dead or unable to continue fighting. You can regain lost
hit points by rest and biopsionic healing, but they cannot exceed their maximum. Your maximum hit points
are equal to 1d6 plus your Constitution modifier, down
to a minimum of 1 hit point. Warriors and Adventurers with the Partial Warrior class option can add a +2
bonus to this total.
Now note down your base attack bonus. For most
PCs, this is equal to half your character level, rounded
down, so it’s +0 for most characters. If your hero is a
Warrior or an Adventurer with the Partial Warrior
class option, your beginning base attack bonus is +1.
Record your Physical, Mental, and Evasion saving
throws. Your Physical saving throw is 15 minus the
better of your Strength or Constitution attribute modifiers. Your Mental saving throw is 15 minus the better
of your Wisdom or Charisma attribute modifiers. Your
Evasion saving throw is 15 minus the better of your
Dexterity or Intelligence attribute modifiers. If you
have a penalty in both modifiers, it’s possible to have a
saving throw of 16 or more.
Lastly, either choose an equipment package from
the list on the opposite page or roll 2d6 x 100 to find out
how many credits you have to buy your beginning gear.

PCs and Languages
The standard language of the late Terran Mandate
was a highly hybridized version of English. All PCs
are assumed to speak “Mandate” unless they’ve got
a very good reason not to, and will rapidly pick up
enough to get by otherwise.
PCs also speak all the languages appropriate to their background and history. A native
of a French-speaking world will naturally speak
French, or whatever French is in 3200 AD.
Linguist PCs with the Know skill know additional languages; one more at level-0, three more
at level-1, six more at level-2, ten more at level-3,
and all sector-known languages at level-4. PCs
who are far-traveled or versed in dealing with
other cultures may substitute Connect instead of
Know to determine their bonus languages.

EQUIPMENT PACKAGES
Rather than choosing gear from the Equipment chapter, you can just take a premade package from this page
instead of taking your starting credits.
Once you’ve chosen your equipment, make sure to
note down the damage and hit bonus of your weapons,
and the Armor Class of any armor you have.
For weapons, your hit bonus is your base attack
bonus plus your applicable skill, plus the attribute modifier used by the weapon. For ranged weapons, this
is usually Dexterity, while most melee weapons are
Strength or Dexterity. Ranged energy weapons add +1
to this, as they lack recoil or windage. Damage is equal
to the weapon’s damage die plus the attribute modifier.
For armor, your total Armor Class is that of your
armor plus your Dexterity modifier. Multiple suits of
armor do not stack together.

QUICK CHARACTER CREATION
If you don’t have the time or inclination to do things
the leisurely way, you can use these pages to quickly
roll up a hero. You can either pick or roll from any of
the tables to get a character that suits.

The first step is to roll on the class table below. This will
give you your class, your attributes, the hit point die to
roll, and your attack bonus. Each class “style” hints at
the kind of PC those attributes might describe.

Next, it’s time to pick or roll from the background table
to the right. Don’t worry if it doesn’t seem to fit your
class; if your Melee Warrior happens to roll a past as
a Scholar, just take a moment to decide why it is that
an erudite scientist might also have a savage left hook.
You can switch around your attributes if you want to
make things fit more closely, such as swapping your
Intelligence and Charisma in the case above.
The background options are general concepts as
described starting on page 10. Your hero might be
a model example of their type, or you might shuffle
around their details a little, deciding your Ranged Warrior Official is an ex-cop bounced out of the force after
investigating an alien smuggling ring a little too closely.
Once you’ve rolled or chosen your background,
note down the three skills listed with it. If one of the
skills says “Any Combat”, choose either Punch, Shoot,
or Stab depending on what fits best for your hero.
You’ll want to decide on your homeworld at this
point too. If you’re not familiar with the campaign
setting, describe your hero’s background and ask the
GM which planet they’re most likely from. The GM
can then fill you in on any important cultural or social
details that might’ve influenced your hero’s history.

Background

If you picked or rolled the Psychic class, roll twice on
the table to the left to find out what psychic disciplines
you’ve trained to level-0. If you roll or pick the same
one twice, it’s level-1, and you should pick a free level-1
technique from the Psionics chapter on page 28.
Take a minute to decide where you were trained
to safely use your innate powers. If you’re not sure, ask
the GM which psychic academy makes the most sense.

QUICK CHARACTER CREATION •27
Now roll 1d6 or pick from the table below to get appropriate foci for your hero, assuming you’d rather not
pick freely. All the foci listed below are gained at level 1
proficiency and are described starting on page 20. Psychics can pick one focus. The other classes get one free
pick, plus one more combat focus for Warriors and one
more non-combat focus for Experts.
When you choose a focus, you might get a bonus
skill from it. If you don’t have that skill, you gain it at
Class

level-0. If you have it at level-0, it becomes level-1. And
if you already have it at level-1, pick any other non-psychic skill instead that isn’t already level-1.
The focus you pick or roll tells you a lot about your
hero’s past. A smooth Expert who’s a Connected Diplomat might have been an underworld fixer, while a
Healer with Specialization in Talk could have been a
psychiatrist or therapist. Take a moment to figure out
how your hero’s foci reflect their past experience.

Now it’s time for a few final touches.
Pick or roll a bonus skill. You can use the table to
the right or just choose any non-psychic skill to add at
level-0 to your hero. You can pick a skill you already
have at level-0 to make it level-1 instead.
If you’re playing a Psychic, note down your beginning maximum Effort, which is equal to 1 plus your
highest psychic skill plus the better of your Wisdom
or Constitution modifiers.
Write down your saving throws. Your Physical saving throw is equal to 15 minus your Strength
or Constitution modifiers, whichever is better. Your
Evasion saving throw is equal to 15 minus the better
of your Dexterity or Intelligence modifiers, and your
Mental saving throw is 15 minus the better of your
Wisdom or Charisma modifiers.
Pick your starting equipment, either rolling 2d6
x 100 to find your beginning credit total or picking a
package from page 25. Note down your beginning hit
bonus totals and damage for any weapons you have,
and the Armor Class total for any armor you wear.
Finally, put a name on this budding hero and
choose their initial goal. What are they trying to accomplish right now? Get rich? Get off their tedious
homeworld? Take revenge on a local tyrant? Whatever
you pick should be something that motivates your hero
from the very start, and it should also be something that
complements the interests of the rest of the players.
Nobody’s going to thank you if you roll up a PC that
none of the other party members would want to associate with, or one that can’t be expected to play nicely
with the rest of the group.
