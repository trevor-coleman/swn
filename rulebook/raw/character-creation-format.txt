24• FINAL TOUCHES


FINAL TOUCHES
You’re almost finished. Just a few more things to note
down, and you’ll have an adventurer ready for play.
      First, pick one more non-psychic skill of your
choice. This pick represents your hobbies, your side
interests, or some well of natural talent. You gain it at
level-0 if you don’t already have it. Otherwise, it stacks
to increase the skill to level-1. You can’t pick a skill you
already have at level-1.
      Next, determine your maximum hit points. Your
hit points are a measure of how close you are to death
or defeat; when you run out of them, your character is
dead or unable to continue fighting. You can regain lost
hit points by rest and biopsionic healing, but they can-
not exceed their maximum. Your maximum hit points
are equal to 1d6 plus your Constitution modifier, down
to a minimum of 1 hit point. Warriors and Adventur-
ers with the Partial Warrior class option can add a +2
bonus to this total.
      Now note down your base attack bonus. For most
PCs, this is equal to half your character level, rounded
down, so it’s +0 for most characters. If your hero is a
Warrior or an Adventurer with the Partial Warrior
class option, your beginning base attack bonus is +1.
      Record your Physical, Mental, and Evasion saving
throws. Your Physical saving throw is 15 minus the
better of your Strength or Constitution attribute mod-
ifiers. Your Mental saving throw is 15 minus the better
of your Wisdom or Charisma attribute modifiers. Your
Evasion saving throw is 15 minus the better of your
Dexterity or Intelligence attribute modifiers. If you
have a penalty in both modifiers, it’s possible to have a
saving throw of 16 or more.
      Lastly, either choose an equipment package from
the list on the opposite page or roll 2d6 x 100 to find out
how many credits you have to buy your beginning gear.


             PCs and Languages
  The standard language of the late Terran Mandate
  was a highly hybridized version of English. All PCs
  are assumed to speak “Mandate” unless they’ve got
  a very good reason not to, and will rapidly pick up
  enough to get by otherwise.
       PCs also speak all the languages appropri-
  ate to their background and history. A native
  of a French-speaking world will naturally speak
  French, or whatever French is in 3200 AD.
       Linguist PCs with the Know skill know addi-
  tional languages; one more at level-0, three more
  at level-1, six more at level-2, ten more at level-3,
  and all sector-known languages at level-4. PCs
  who are far-traveled or versed in dealing with
  other cultures may substitute Connect instead of
  Know to determine their bonus languages.
