82• CYBERWARE


CYBERWARE
Postech medical science and neural interface technol-
ogy are sophisticated enough to meld metal and flesh
into a coherent whole. The creation of advanced cy-
berware is not beyond the theoretical capability of TL4
societies, and pretech worlds can produce cyberware
of such sophistication as to blur the lines between or-
ganism and artifice.
     Yet cyberware is rarely available on most worlds,
even those with the nominal technology level to sup-
port it. The advantages that cyberware can give a user
are great, but the cost of building, fitting, and implant-
ing these devices is huge compared to simply buying a
handheld device to do the same function. There are few
buyers for a 15,000 credit ghost talker implant when a
compad retails for a hundred credits.
     The market that does exist is largely for those few
elite operatives and dignitaries who are willing to pay
exorbitant sums for the smallest advantage. Most cy-
berware is custom-built for its users, and it can be an
adventure in itself to find a lab capable of manufac-
turing an augmentation and successfully implanting
it. Some worlds have industrialized the production of
cyberware, however, making it much cheaper and in
much wider circulation. Even then, these worlds rarely
export much cyberware due to the heavy infrastructure
necessary to fit and implant the wares. Those who want
the tech will have to find such planets and do their own
negotiations there.
     Aside from the difficulties of cost and scarcity,
cyberware also taxes the wearer’s body. Each piece of        Bioadaptation Augments: These additional synthetic
