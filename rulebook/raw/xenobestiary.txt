XENOBESTIARY
A band of interstellar adventurers can expect to encounter a wide range of creatures in the course of their
travels. Whether the hungry fauna of an uncharted
planet or the trigger-happy gunmen of an alien organ
smuggler, a GM needs to have the relevant statistics at
hand to manage probable hostilities.

Handling Potential Combat

Before picking foes from this chapter, however, a GM
should make sure that the enemies chosen and the
perils generated are appropriate for the situation. This
does not mean that the enemies have to be an “appropriate” combat challenge for the PC group, one that
they have a reasonable chance of defeating. It means
that they should be appropriate to the location and role
they fill in the setting.
If there’s a stretch of wilderness adjacent to a human community, a party-eating hellbeast should not
be lairing there without some notice by the locals. If
such an unstoppable horror does exist secretly in the
wilderness, the fact that it is hidden should be somehow
explained or meaningful. NPCs notice hazards next
door, and PCs who pay attention should hear about
that danger before they end up walking into its cave.
In the same vein, if the PCs run into a bunch of
street thugs, the hooligans should not be exhibiting
Spartan discipline and crack military expertise unless
the PCs have gone slumming on a planet of genetic
super-soldiers. The goons might actually not be much
of a combat threat at all, and dangerous only for the
potential grudges the PCs could earn in executing them.
Lastly, don’t add combat encounters that are unavoidable. There are very few realistic situations where
the only possible result is a gun battle. A group of trigger-happy mercs might happen to be sitting directly on
top of the party’s objective, but if there’s no way to lure
them away or sneak past them– or worse, if you’re not
prepared to allow the PCs to try to lure them away or
sneak past them– then the players will learn not to try
to solve problems with anything but a hot gun barrel.
Combat in Stars Without Number is dangerous.
Every squeeze of a trigger risks killing a novice adventurer, and even a veteran of countless heroic deeds
can get mowed down in a hurry by a half-dozen goons
with mag rifles. If your adventures funnel the PCs into
near-unavoidable firefights or saber-toothed alien
monsters, the PCs are going to suffer casualties. A certain degree of death can add spice and excitement to a
game and help make player choices feel more meaningful, but inevitable gory disembowelment in the third
inescapable pirate brawl of the day is just tedious.

The Reaction Roll

One of the GM’s most important tools for managing
encounters with NPCs is the reaction roll. Whenever
the PCs first meet with a creature or NPC, the GM
should roll 2d6 and consult the following table.
2d6

Reaction Result

2

Hostile, reacting as negatively as is plausible

3-5

Negative, unfriendly and unhelpful

6-8

Neutral, reacting predictably or warily

9-11

Positive, potentially cooperative with PCs

12

Friendly, helpful as is plausible to be

The result should be taken in context. If the PCs
just happen to run into a pack of hab-complex gangers, a positive result might simply mean the gangers
think it’s a bad idea to interfere with the PCs. That
same result when meeting a bored starport bureaucrat
might mean she’s feeling magnanimous, and is willing
to help the PCs accomplish their purpose. In general,
low results make the situation more hostile than the
predictable baseline, while high results make the NPC
more friendly or cooperative than they might normally
be under the circumstances.
Reaction rolls are important because they help a
GM adjudicate a situation in a potentially surprising or
interesting way. If the PCs are crossing a radioactive
badland crawling with violent scavenger tribes, the
GM might just reflexively assume that every scavenger
band they encounter is immediately going to reach for
their scrap-guns. A reaction roll is a cue for the GM
to pause and think, and a friendly result can open up a
situation with far more potential novelty than the sixth
consecutive gun battle. Conversely, even if everything
seems to suggest an NPC should be helpful and friendly
toward the PCs, a negative result can get the GM thinking about potential reasons why the NPC is so hostile
towards supposedly allied PCs.
An NPC or a group’s initial reaction is not the last
word, of course. A silver-tongued PC might be able to
talk them out of hostility or induce them to do the party
a favor, and more pragmatic offers of money, favors,
or incipient violence might also sway their attitudes.
Such manipulation happens after the initial attitude is
determined, however, and what exactly the PCs offer
or threaten will usually depend on how the NPC is initially reacting to them.

194• HUMANITY

HUMANITY
Humans are likely to form the great majority of the
NPCs that the heroes encounter, whether as patrons,
companions, or the targets of their guns. In many cases
a GM won’t need to bother with combat statistics for an
NPC. They might be so unmartial that they can present
no serious threat to a party of hardened freebooters, or
so distant that there’s no real chance that they’ll become
engaged in combat. In others, however, it’s necessary to
decide how much a particular NPC is worth in a fight.
The example human opponents here assume
normal baseline humanity. Those who have received
extensive cyberware, gengineering, psychic augmentation, or other exotic treatments may have abilities far
in excess of their normal brethren, including unique
powers and special abilities.

Degrees of Danger

Most human NPCs on advanced, civilized planets are
of almost no use in combat. By societal training and
personal inclination, they are almost incapable of responding to lethal threats with a quick, decisive reaction. Citizens of less peaceful societies, where violence
is a commonplace, will have more useful reactions
to such hostilities. Men and women who have been
hardened to combat by experience or training will also
respond more effectively.
The combat statistics provided here cover the usual range of human martial talent. At the bottom are
those soft citizens of peaceful worlds and at the top
are those engines of mortal ruin who are the most dangerous men and women in the sector. Even more heroic appetites for slaughter can be found in those who
have been altered by genetic engineering or advanced
technical modifications, but such paragons of pain are
special cases to be judged by the GM accordingly.
When assigning combat statistics to NPC, it’s important not to be influenced by the personal prowess of
the PCs. If country estate is protected by ordinary security guards, then the guards should be ordinary security
guards, whether or not the party could reasonably hope
to defeat a dozen such protectors in open combat. The
universe does not scale to the PCs. If a party of untested novices finds themselves facing a squad of elite
killers, they should run. If those famously lethal killers
encounter the PCs six levels later, their fame might get
abbreviated in a hurry by the PCs’ grim new expertise.
This even-handedness is important in creating a
plausible, functional world for the players to operate in.
If they know that challenges will be scaled up or down
to give them a “fair fight” then it hardly matters what
challenges they choose to face. Planning to carefully
avoid excess dangers and betting on overcoming more
reasonable threats makes their choices meaningful in
your game world, and encourages the players to engage
carefully with the setting.

Using the Table

The table provided in this section gives you benchmarks for some basic NPC types and then a selection
of specific examples. When you’re creating your own
NPCs, you can use the benchmarks to get an idea of
where they should be, and the specific examples can be
pulled during play when you’re in need of quick opponents to stock your adventures.
The table provides simplified combat statistics.
NPCs don’t normally have foci, specific skill levels,
attribute scores, or any of the other details that add
complexity to PCs. Nor do they have classes or class
abilities. Instead, simpler totals and summaries are used
to account for these other factors. You can give NPCs
class powers and foci if you wish, or even create an
NPC as if they were a full-fledged PC, but that kind
of detail and work is more than most NPCs are worth.
HD is the NPC’s hit dice. The overwhelming majority of NPCs have only one hit die. Only men and
women with a history of surviving violence and dealing with mortal peril should have more than one hit
die. Just because an NPC is “important” doesn’t mean
they have more hit dice. The CEO of an interstellar
megacorp probably has one hit die, as does the president of the planetary government. Conversely, the
grizzled warrior-king of a lostworlder monarchy or a
poison-wary bishop of a church where promotion is
through mortality might have half a dozen hit dice. The
most danger-hardened legends of a sector should have
about ten hit dice, or more if they’ve been somehow
altered by gengineering or advanced technology. An
NPC’s hit points are rolled at 1d8 for each hit die.
AC is the NPC’s usual Armor Class. This will vary
with the armor they’re wearing, and some NPCs might
have an included +1 or +2 bonus if they’re especially
dexterous, but the listed score reflects the armor they
usually have on. By default, this is street armor that
is not obvious to casual inspection. Some entries are
marked “primitive”, meaning that their armor is ignored by advanced weapons, while others are marked
“combat”, meaning that they wear very obviously protective armor. Such NPCs might need to wear less obvious gear in some social situations. A few of them are
marked “powered”, meaning that the NPC normally
has access to some kind of advanced power armor that
renders them immune to primitive weapons. When
creating your own NPCs, give them the armor that is
appropriate to their role and situation.
Atk is the NPC’s attack bonus. For the sake of simplicity, this includes any attribute modifiers, skill bonus,
or other extra lethality that the NPC might have earned.
For most NPCs, their attack bonus is equal to their hit
dice. Martial NPCs might have an additional bonus on
top of that, or even attack twice with each Main Action.

Dmg is the damage the NPC inflicts in combat. For
human combatants, this depends on the weapon they’re
using, with most ordinary men and women carrying
no real weapon. Very capable warriors might do additional damage on top of the weapon’s roll, from +1
to +4 points.
Move is the distance the NPC travels when they
take a Move action in combat. For humans, this is ten
meters, though gengineered or other boosted subjects
might be able to move faster than this.
ML is the NPC’s Morale score, their likelihood of
retreating when in danger. When an NPC faces unusual peril, they need to make a Morale check on 2d6.
If they roll equal or less than their Morale score, they
withstand the danger and continue fighting. If they roll
more than their Morale, they break. Poorly-trained
combatants will simply run for their lives or beg for
mercy, while more hardened ones will make a fighting
withdrawal to a place of safety. PCs never need to make
Morale checks.
Most groups will need to make a Morale check
the first time one of their members is killed or disabled,
and the first time it looks like they’re losing the fight. If
they succeed in both checks, they’ll continue fighting as
long as it doesn’t seem hopeless. NPCs with no martial
aptitude at all must also make a Morale check when
lethal combat begins; on a failure, they’re too shocked,
frightened, or disbelieving to do anything useful, and
will stand frozen, run in terror, or try to ignore what’s
obviously happening around them.

Skills summarizes the NPC’s general aptitude at
skill checks related to their profession or role. When
the NPC needs to make a skill check or compete in an
opposed skill check, they may add this skill bonus to
their roll if the test relates to role. If the activity has
nothing especially to do with what the NPC would be
good at, they cannot add this bonus, and just roll the
skill check unmodified. Most NPCs will have this at
+1, while skilled professionals will have it at +2, and
exceptionally gifted and expert NPCs will have it at +3
or +4. Sector-wide legends will have it at +5.
Saves are the single saving throw score that all
NPCs use whenever they need to make a saving throw.
Whether Mental Physical, or Evasion, the NPC rolls
against this single target. Most NPCs have a save score
of 15 minus half their hit dice, rounded down.

Psychics and Special Traits
When building NPCs with psychic powers or other special abilities, it’s usually not worth the effort
of rolling them up like PCs. Just assign them a few
abilities you think will matter during the game and
give them a third of their hit dice in maximum
Effort, rounded up.
In the same vein, gengineered humans or
rare virtuosos might have abilities akin to Foci or
unique powers. Just assign them as fits the situation, and don’t worry about making them like PCs.

196• ROBOTS AND VIS

ROBOTS AND VIS
The prevalence of robots varies between sectors. Some
positively teem with sentient VIs programmed for various purposes, while others have hardly any robotics at
all beyond industrial automation. The creation of particularly sophisticated bots, especially sentient-seeming
VIs, is critically influenced by the local metadimensional energy environment. With an unfriendly higher-order energy shadow, the intricate quantum flux of VI
“brains” cannot function properly. True AIs are immune
to such vagaries, but True AIs are almost impossible
to create in bulk, even for the lost industries of the
Terran Mandate.

Expert Systems and VIs

In the vast majority of sectors, robots are operated
by expert systems programmed to carry out a specific
kind of work. These expert systems may feign human
intelligence, but they are non-sentient and incapable
of dealing with environments and situations outside
their normal operational scope. The more sophisticated and expensive the expert system, the more flexible
it is about handling events within its purview.
In some sectors, however, the local environment
is suitable for the creation of extremely sophisticated
expert systems bolstered by quantum neural nets. It is
a constant point of debate over whether the resultant
“Virtual Intelligences” are truly self-aware or simply
give a perfect impression of such. Some sectors hold
the former, and grant VI full human rights, forbidding
their makers from implanting behavioral imperatives.
Most sectors believe the latter, using VIs as a labor
force programmed to deeply enjoy their utilitarian
function. VIs in such sectors can be bought, sold, and
mistreated much as any other piece of property.
While VIs have or can mimic human-level intelligence, they can also be programmed with behavioral
imperatives or curbs, giving them a deep urge to perform a certain kind of work or an unbreakable inability
to carry out certain kinds of acts. Most service VIs are
programmed with imperatives to love their work and
be thoroughly happy in carrying it out, as well as with
curbs against harming human beings or allowing themselves to be damaged. These impulses are overwhelming, but not especially nuanced; the more specific and
complex the programmed psychological limit, the more
prone it is to failure or misguidance.
VIs are not True AIs. They do not have a quantum
identity core and they are inexorably tied into the specific hardware and chassis they were created to operate.
While mods and adjustments can be made to this “birth
body”, the VI cannot be transplanted into a new chassis,
nor can they survive the destruction of their body.
VIs are much more difficult to produce than
non-sentient expert systems. The quantum growth
process is much more reliable and tractable than that

used to create a True AI, but it still fails annoyingly
often. As a consequence, even sectors where the environment allows the creation of VIs often prefer to
use simple, cheap, reliably-replicable “dumb” expert
systems for mundane tasks.

Expert System Bots

The robots listed in the adjacent table are standard-issue expert system bots, each one equipped with a level
1 expert system. Each expert system is programmed to
handle a particular role: security, tour guidance, industrial labor, household cleaning, personal companionship, child care, or some other general field. The most
basic programming and cognitive hardware counts as
a “level 1” system. More sophisticated work allows for
level 2 programming, up to level 4 as the maximum for
most TL4 sectors.
Each level of expert system beyond the first comes
with upgrades to the robot’s durability, danger management, and exception handling skills. They also add to
the robot’s base cost; a level 2 expert system doubles a
robot’s base cost, for example. The table below gives
the various expert system levels, the hit die and saving
throw bonus granted by each, the attack bonus a given
level adds, and the skill check modifier to be applied to
checks related to the bot’s intended function.

Whenever the bot is put in a position not covered by its programming, it needs to make a confusion
check. The GM rolls 2d6, adding its skill bonus, against
a difficulty based on the strangeness of the situation.
A situation partly within its usual compass might be
difficulty 7, while a completely uncovered event would
be difficulty 9, and a situation that is both completely
uncovered and clearly dangerous would be 11. On a
success, the expert system does something reasonable
and in line with its function. On a failure, the expert
system does what it’s normally meant to do in an inappropriate way or direction.
Damaged bots can be repaired by someone with at
least Fix-0 skill and a postech toolkit. One unit of spare
parts and fifteen minutes of work can repair a number
of lost hit points equal to the bot’s expert system level.
Expert system bots reduced to zero hit points are destroyed and cannot be salvaged.
Expert system bots do have “morale” of a kind;
when destruction seems imminent, most are programmed to retreat. This can be overridden by owners.

In sectors where VIs can still be manufactured, the
price is equivalent to ten times the cost of an equivalent expert system bot. Thus, a stock companion bot
upgraded with VI programming would cost 25,000
credits. To give a top-of-the-line heavy warbot with
a level 4 expert system VI wiring would leave the bot
costing a tremendous four million credits.
VI wiring does not integrate well with conventional expert system programming. The same static
procedures and protocols that can make a level 4 expert system so good at its specific task are difficult for
a human-like VI intellect to process, and it requires
intensive and expensive cognitive reinforcement to
allow the VI to take advantage of these resources. As a
consequence, it is very rare for VIs to be implanted in
high-end expert system bots.
Most VIs do not develop additional skills or competencies, nor do they exhibit personal growth or
changes in personality. They are the way they have
been programmed, even if inhibitor curbs and behavioral imperatives are absent.
Some VIs, however, are different. For whatever
inexplicable reason, these VIs are capable of learning
and growing as human beings are. They lack the potential for godlike intelligence possessed by True AIs
and they cannot make effective use of supplementary
cognitive resources as True AIs can, but over time and
with experience, these VIs can become as skilled and
capable as any human.
Such “clever” VIs are an annoyance in sectors
where VI bots are common. Buyers don’t want their
receptionist bots to suddenly decide they’d rather be
poets, and while behavioral imperatives and inhibitor
curbs still have an effect on clever VIs, some of these
bots can “out-think” their limits and sidestep these
blocks. Some worlds allow clever VIs to exist as free
citizens, while others consider them public nuisances
to be scrapped if they wander off from their owners.
VI bots are more durable than their ordinary cousins. If reduced to zero hit points by trauma less than a
hit with a Heavy weapon or similar complete ruin, they
can be repaired with 24 hours of work by one tech with
Fix-0. Jury-rigging a downed VI back into operation is
much faster, allowing them to “heal” with spare parts
as if they were an ordinary bot. If reduced to zero HP
again before a 24-hour overhaul, however, they perish.

While a wide range of bots are available on the market
in most sectors, the selection given here cover most of
the robots likely to be encountered by PCs. Most civilian bots are programmed to avoid harming humans,
but such programming can be overridden by sufficiently determined owners.
Janitor bots are ubiquitous, cheap and reliable
droids that can clean up detritus and keep an office,
street, or private home tidy. Their small size and limited array of tools make them useless in a fight save as
targets or convenient explosives carriers.
Civilian security bots are sometimes found guarding locations. They’re not smart enough to handle
complex human interactions, but their tireless determination is convenient when guarding a place that few
humans are expected to enter. Most models use a stunning touch that non-lethally disables targets, while less
gentle bots are equipped with guns or melee weapons.
Repair bots and industrial work bots are found at
work sites and in starships or other complex technical
edifices. Expert system repair bots are extremely efficient about dealing with standard failures and damage,
but they can “panic” when faced with crises beyond
their usual operating parameters. Industrial work bots
are slow, tough, heavy machines most often used for
lifting and manipulating heavy objects in need of laser
welding or other shaping.
Companion bots range from nannybots and petbots
to specially-designed “companions” for other purposes.
The latter are strictly regulated on many worlds, either
to encourage reproduction, to quash their use for reprehensible urges, or out of perceived fears of societal
decay and decadence.
Soldier bots are designed on humanoid lines so as
to easily use standard human vehicles and equipment.
The chaotic and confusing nature of warfare leaves
most soldier bots of somewhat limited utility without
a human bot wrangler to direct them, but when a wave
attack is needed, a simple self-preservation toggle can
be flipped off and the iron horde can be aimed at a foe.
Heavy warbots are ogreish engines of war with integral plasma guns and the ability to attack twice with
each Main Action. In addition, most are capable of
mounting a Heavy weapon which may be fired in lieu
of the plasma guns. They’re most often used as mobile
heavy weapons platforms for squads in the field.

198• ROBOTS AND VIS

Robots In Your Campaign

A GM is not obligated to include VIs or ubiquitous robotics in her campaign. Adding these elements can have
a significant effect on a setting, and sometimes they
can prove to be a distraction from the sort of play that
the group wants to have. A GM is always well within
her rights to simply decide that the sector lacks the
necessary metadimensional environment for VI production and is short on many of the critical minerals
for producing expert system bots. Outside of industrial
assembly lines and mindless extraction work, labor is
performed by humans.
Sometimes, however, a GM will want to include
VIs in her sector, either because she’s emulating a genre
where intelligent robots are a commonplace, or because
a particular player wants to play a PC VI, or because
she simply likes them.
If a GM does decide to add VIs to her setting, she’ll
need to decide how common they are and how most
of the worlds in the sector treat them. The simplest
way to do this is to gently gloss over the economic and
social impact of VIs. The world operates much as it
does today, with humans doing most of the work and
VIs serving only occasional functions as showpieces
of the wealthy or off-stage laborers in industry. They
are programmed to love their work, they’re “happy” in
a robotic sense, and the various worlds of the sector
give little consideration to wider issues of VI rights or
the morality of programmed VI behavioral imperatives.

Other GMs will want to increase the impact of VIs
on particular worlds. Perhaps some of them have largely replaced their low-skilled members with VI laborers,
and the replaced humans are either frustrated and angry or kept pacified by robotic dole payments. Other
worlds might dispute the lack of rights that most VIs
have, insisting that a VI ought not to be programmed
with behavioral imperatives at “birth”, but be allowed
to choose its own functionality. Of course, it might be
that almost no one would bother to build them in that
case, but such crusaders might believe it better that a
VI never be “born” than that it be created in servitude.
In brief, the GM can pick some aspect of VI existence
and use the conflicts inherent in it to spice up the sector.
Expert system bots are less disruptive to a campaign because they come with less moral baggage that
a society has to deal with. It’s easy for a GM to simply
decide that most expert system bots are only smart
enough for simple industrial tasks or menial labor, and
that the impact they have on the local economy doesn’t
necessarily force it into some strange futuristic pattern.
There are still poor janitors, grouchy middle-aged security guards, and cynical street-corner prostitutes in
an age of robotic labor.
Some PC groups will be very keen to buy robots
of their own, the better to help in their adventures. So
long as you keep an expert system’s limitations in mind,
this shouldn’t be disruptive, and it would make an excellent sink for a party’s excess money.

VI PLAYER CHARACTERS •199

VI PLAYER CHARACTERS
In campaigns where the GM allows it, a player can
choose to make a VI as a player character. They do this
by spending their free focus pick on one of the origins
listed below. These origin foci have only one level, and
normally can only be taken during character creation.
In exceptional cases, a human PC transformed into a
full-conversion cyborg might be allowed to take it later.

Special VI Rules

All VI PCs have the same attributes, hit points, abilities,
and character classes as humans do, but normal VIs
cannot be Psychics nor take the Partial Psychic class
option for Adventurers. They are created the same
way as any other human PC and start out at first level.
While they may have been built to be a particular type
of bot, they use their own statistics, and not those for
their type on page 197. VIs that are not wearing armor
normally have Armor Class 10, just as humans do.
VIs need neither sleep, eat, nor drink, requiring
one Type B cell per week of operation away from readily-available current. They are immune to vacuum but
suffer degradation from radiation as humans do. They
cannot be poisoned or diseased by normal forms of
toxin. They can be reprogrammed, altering or erasing
their personality and behavioral limits, but such mental remodeling takes at least an undisturbed month to
execute by someone with at least Program-1 skill. Most
VIs will fight to their destruction to avoid such a fate.
VIs can be healed with spare parts and the work of
someone with Fix-0 skill. VIs can always repair themselves, even without the requisite skill. Each unit of
spare parts heals lost hit points equal to the VI’s character level and takes fifteen minutes to apply. VIs cannot
normally be affected by biopsionic healing effects.
VIs reduced to zero hit points but not entirely
smashed are incapacitated and Badly Damaged. Removing this quality requires 24 hours of work by a
technician and at least one unit of spare parts, after
which damage can be repaired as normal. As a field
expedient, a tech can jury-rig a Badly Damaged VI in
the field, healing it with spare parts at the normal rate
and speed. If such a bot is reduced to zero hit points
again while Badly Damaged, however, it must make a
Physical save or be permanently destroyed.
VIs are intimately connected to their specific hardware, and cannot be transplanted into new forms. Cosmetic alterations can be made, however, and equipment
can be grafted into the VI’s chassis. Such built-in equipment costs twice as much as a stand-alone component
and takes a week to properly integrate into the VI’s
system. A VI can have a total number of encumbrance
points worth of additional gear grafted onto it equal to
half its Constitution score, rounded down. Such gear
may require its own separate power source or ammunition supply. VIs cannot make use of cyberware.

Android

You were built as an android, a robot indistinguishable from a human without a medical-grade inspection.
Most androids are “companion” bots, though other VIs
with roles that involve significant human interaction
may also be built as androids. Minor scuffs and cuts
don’t reveal your robotic nature, but if reduced to zero
hit points, your unnatural innards are obvious.
Level 1: Gain a bonus skill related to your intended function. You have all the usual traits and abilities of
a VI robot.

VI Worker Bot

You were built for industrial or technical labor, where
a human face was an unnecessary luxury. Most such
VI bots are humanoid, if only to more conveniently
manipulate human-scale devices, but their inhuman
nature is obvious.
Level 1: Gain a bonus skill related to your intended
function. Choose an attribute associated with your
work and gain a +1 bonus to its modifier, up to a
maximum of +2. You have all the usual traits and
abilities of a VI robot.

VI Vehicle Bot

Some VIs were instantiated in actual vehicles rather
than conventional humanoid bodies. Most were purely
synthetic in origins, but some sectors retain the techniques for brain transplants into non-human bodies.
Some polities have been known to conduct full-body
cyberneticization of soldiers into tanks, warships, attack helicopters, and other military vehicles. As a vehicle, you are usually equipped with manipulator arms
that can be used on adjacent objects. You may operate the individual elements of your vehicle as if they
were your own limbs, attacking once per round with a
mounted weapon of your choice.
Level 1: Gain Pilot as a bonus skill. Pick a vehicle acceptable to the GM, usually a drone, hoverbike
or gravcar. You become that vehicle. You retain
your usual attributes but gain the vehicle’s Armor
score. You are Armor Class 10, modified by your
Dexterity score. A tech can improve your Armor
Class by aftermarket modifications, adding up to
three times their Fix skill to your Armor Class at
a cost of 1,000 credits per point of improvement.
You use the vehicle’s hit points until your
own normally-rolled hit point score exceeds that
number. Many VI vehicles purchase a drone or
humanoid robot body to carry on board and employ for remote operation in areas unsuitable for
a vehicle; you can pilot a single surrogate body in
lieu of your own Main Action, provided there’s no
ECM to jam the control transmissions.

200• BEASTS

BEASTS
Most alien beasts are simply flavor for a world, odd
creatures to decorate the background and provide some
light interest for the players. Sometimes, however, a
GM needs a genuinely dangerous beast, either to occupy some perilous wilderness or to threaten the PCs
and their allies.
When creating a beast, work from your needs.
Build the creature with the statistics and role that you
need for your adventure, and then decorate those basic
statistics with the creature’s appearance, special hazards,
and behavior.

Creating Beasts

To build an alien beast, it’s easiest to start with some
Terran referent. A completely alien and exotic creature
with no relation to any earthly life form tends to be
very difficult to explain to players and it can be awkward for the GM to guess its normal behavior.
The tables on the opposite page provide some basic suggestions for styling the essential animal features
of the beast. Start with the “Basic Animal Features” to
get the creature’s general theme, and then move on to
identify its body plan. You might then add on some
novelty to its limbs or skin, decide the main weapon it
uses to hunt prey or defend itself, and choose a general
size for the animal.
The basic animal features serve only as a starting
point for your creativity. The creature might have a
mammalian general plan, but you could then decide
that its “fur” is a stiff, glassy mineral exudate that slashes
anything that bites or strikes it. It can be helpful to stick
to one basic animal type for a given alien world, with all
the creatures the PCs encounter sharing similar broad
features or common traits.
While a fully-developed ecosphere might include
countless different evolutionary strategies, sticking to
just one or two in play helps characterize a world and
give a sense of consistency to its fauna. If all the dangerous creatures of Scutum have thick moss-colored
armor plating, then the PCs will be able to guess that a
strange creature with thick moss-colored armor plating
is probably an import from Scutum.

Swarms

Sometimes a beast is only meaningfully dangerous in
vast packs, like a swarm of ants or a squealing tide of
ravenous rats. Other times beasts are found most often
in huge herds rather than as lone individuals.
To create such a swarm, take the basic animal type
and quadruple its hit dice. For tiny creatures that have
only 1 hit point, give the swarm 4 hit dice. The swarm
gets its usual attack against anyone in contact with it,
but on a miss, it still does the minimum possible damage to the target unless the victim is immune to its
attacks. Thus, a rat swarm that has a +1 attack bonus
and does 1d2 damage on a hit would roll that attack
against every PC caught in the swarm. On a hit, they
would do 1d2 damage, and a miss would still do 1 point.
Any attack against the swarm automatically hits,
assuming the weapon is useful. Firing a pistol into a
creeping carpet of ants is singularly useless, but waving
a flaming torch in front of rats or throwing a grenade
into the swarm might help dispatch the pack.

Beast Behavior

Many alien creatures will have no inherited aversion
to humans, and will not fear them. Predators will hunt
them if they look like food and prey will ignore them
if they don’t look like predators.
In combat, predators will only fight to the death if
maddened or cornered. Sane predators cannot afford to
get hurt while hunting. In addition to the usual times
for Morale checks, beasts must make an additional
check the first time their “prey” harms the predator.

Importing Creatures

Aside from the beasts you can create with these charts,
an endless supply of fantasy monsters and exotic creatures await lifting from other old-school games. Almost
any of the “monsters” found in traditional old-school
role-playing games can be imported almost unchanged
into Stars Without Number, requiring little more than
an attack bonus and Armor Class conversion. Reskin
them to fit your needs, and voila; you have your beast.

effects incapacitate a victim, though blindness or ongoing damage may not wholly disable a PC.
PCs can usually attempt a Physical save to resist a
poison. Toxins can be treated with a medkit or antidote
stim. If the medic lacks the specific antidote to a poison,
they can make an Int/Heal skill check to try to halt it.
The difficulty is usually 9, with one check allowed.

202• ALIENS

ALIENS
Exotic alien races are a staple of science fiction, and
most GMs running Stars Without Number are going
to want a few types of sapients to round out a sector.
Some GMs might prefer to run a strictly human game,
leaving humanity alone in this particular corner of the
cosmos, but other GMs will want to have the details
of a few alien races in hand, if only to help envision
the kind of artifacts and ruins that they might have left
behind. This section will discuss the role of aliens in a
game and a process for creating your own alien races.

The Use of Aliens in the Game

When adding an alien race to your sector, it’s necessary to keep in mind the ultimate purpose you have for
including them. A given species might be fascinating
to you, but if they don’t actually help to accomplish
something for your game it’s likely that the players will
simply gloss over their existence. By having a concrete
purpose in mind for a race you can ensure that the
players have a useful reason to interact with them.
Aliens are useful as antagonists. The classic “bugeyed monster” trope has survived for a reason; unthinkingly hostile and uncommunicative beings make great
fodder for brute physical struggle. Making these monsters part of a sapient, tool-using species allows them to
scale upward in threat the way no beast can, and continue to imperil even an experienced, well-equipped
band of adventurers.
Antagonism can take more forms than simple
combativeness. Aliens can want things, and want them
for reasons that would make no sense at all to a human.
Biological imperatives, exotic religions, alien philosophies, and customs born on completely un-Earth-like
worlds can all justify goals and purposes that would be
entirely irrational for a human being. Humans might
find themselves at cross purposes with these aliens
without ever fully understanding why the beings are
pursuing a given goal.
From a GM’s perspective, this is a wonderful trait
for building adventures. If you need aliens to pursue
some goal, however bizarre, you can simply add a trait
to them that makes that goal important. For example,
if you need aliens to be obsessed with wiping out the
humans on a given planet, you can simply decide that
the planet is their ancestral homeworld, to which they
must return every thousand years in order to perform a
great spawning rite. The presence of the humans there
defiles the world, and the aliens grow increasingly frantic as the time for the rite approaches.
Aliens also make excellent patrons for many of the
same reasons that they make good antagonists. You can
give them a good reason to want almost anything, and
players are unlikely to balk at it as unlikely or implausible. If you need to give the players a reason to go
somewhere, do something, or find something, you can

use aliens to drive the process. The matter might be
so important to the aliens that they find themselves
willing to employ human agents to accomplish their
ends, or it may be that only humans have the numbers
and strength to help them.
Aliens are occasions for exploration and discovery. While this may not have the immediate adventure
utility of an antagonist or a patron, one of the things
about sandbox gaming that appeals to many players
is the opportunity to go out and discover new things.
The universe is full of bizarre and exotic beings, and
there can be a lot of enjoyment in learning about their
cultures and traits. Most players aren’t interested in a
full-dress anthropological study of an alien race, but
there is an excitement in visiting uncharted worlds and
meeting strange and wondrous beings.
In some cases, this exploration doesn’t even need
live aliens. The universe is laden with numerous ancient alien ruins, and players can get a good conception
of a long-lost race simply from examining what they’ve
left behind. A GM with a firm grasp on a species’ psychology and physiology has much of what he needs to
create their abandoned cities and outposts and to stock
them with art, artifacts, and remnants for the enticement of exploring PCs.
Humanoid species make the most widely useful
aliens, and most of the species you create should probably be of that variety. Aliens that are too hard to understand tend to be more animate plot devices, operating
by utterly incomprehensible rules and motivations.
Human-like races allow more scope for diplomacy and
response to an alien culture, because their societies are
fundamentally comprehensible by humans.

The Like and the Others

Most alien races in the universe of Stars Without Number can be divided up into two different classes – the
Like and the Others. The Like are those species with intellects and societies that are at least somewhat comprehensible to humankind. They may have exotic biologies
and strange customs, but humans can understand their
motivations and deal with them within a more-or-less
comprehensible framework.
The Others are those species that are simply too
alien for human communication. Entities of sentient
lithic structures, congeries of crystal, even intelligent
waveform interactions created by the interplay of energies through alien rock formations… the Others are
simply too different for humans to understand. Their
goals are incomprehensible, their technology is often
hard to even recognize, let alone use, and it’s possible
that they don’t even realize that humanity is a sentient
species. The Others are generally avoided if at all possible, though at times “wars” break out when an Other
species vents anger on humanity for reasons unknown.

ALIENS •203
Other races are rare, but some xenologists have
suggested that they may be much more common than
humanity imagines. Places that would never support
Like life might be teeming with the bizarre offspring
of Other organisms, unnoticed because human scouts
haven’t bothered to look in such unpromising places.
Many Other species might not even be recognized as
life by humanity.

Alien Biology

As a rule of thumb, it’s easiest to make Like aliens some
flavor of humanoid. They may have a few extra limbs
or somewhat different body geometry, but humanoid
aliens tend to be easier to build and run than those
with drastically different body types. There’s less need
to adjust human assumptions about architecture, technology, and clothing than there would be for a species
of six-legged centauroid mothmen. Of course, if you
enjoy the prospect of working out the ramifications of
having four gripping hands and organic wheels, you
shouldn’t feel shackled to the humanoid shape.
Aliens of the Other type can come in any shape or
size, largely because they aren’t intended to be comprehensible. Their technology and architecture doesn’t
need to have any link with human conceptions of such;
some Others may not even use technology as humans
understand it, but instead manipulate their environment with inborn abilities or subtype-creatures of their
own species. Most Other species function as plot devices in a game, and it’s not necessary to put the same
effort into detailing their “biology” if the species aren’t
intended to make human sense in the first place.
Humanlike aliens are just that; extremely close
to humans in outward appearance. They might have
unusual skin or hair coloration, different hair growth
distributions, an odd number of fingers, cranial ridges,
a novel skin texture, variant ear shapes, or different
average body builds or sizes, but they largely appear
like humans. Xenobiologists postulate that the human
shape is simply a very successful evolutionary route on
Earth-like planets, and other worlds with similar conditions are likely to produce similar sapients. Crank scientists tend to favor theories of pan-galactic Creators
that spread humanlike shapes throughout space; these
theories conspicuously fail to take into account the dramatically different DNA and internal organ makeup of
many humanlike aliens.
In general, it’s easiest to pick a particular real-world
type of organism as a basic template for an alien race.
The reality of their biology might be totally different,
but using a terrestrial animal as a basic pattern can help
you fill in details of structure and appearance that can
otherwise be difficult to extemporize.
Avian aliens favor birdlike features. Feathered
tails, wings, beaks, drastic coloring differences between
males and females, skin either partially or fully covered
in feathers, hollow bones, and clawed feet and hands
are all traits that might be present in an avian-flavored

alien. Such avians might have remarkably good vision
or show unusual talent as pilots thanks to an evolutionary predilection for thinking in three dimensions.
Reptilian aliens can range from the classic “lizard man” look to a more subtle combination of
pebble-scaled skin, membrane frills, broad bodies,
cold-bloodedness, nictitating membranes, an exceptional sense of smell, thick claws, powerful builds,
sharp teeth, and fine scales. Bodies may be broad and
thick like that of a lizard, or perhaps sinuous like that
of a snake. Reptilian aliens might be found especially
on damp, watery worlds, and might be outright amphibious over all or part of their life spans.
Insectile aliens are usually possessed of chitinous
“skin” and one or more pairs of compound eyes. Membranous wings aren’t unknown, but are probably vestigial and useless on all but the smallest or lightest aliens.
Insectile aliens might have sucking mouthparts if their
primary food source is plant sap- or blood- or might
use chewing mandibles instead for a more solid diet.
Insectile aliens that function as a hive collective are
something of a classic trope, but there’s no reason that
a species can’t instead take after more solitary hunting
insects such as beetles or spiders.
Mammalian aliens might have very human-like
appearances, or they might have fur, muzzles, claws, or
quadrupedal modes of locomotion. Mammalian aliens
are easy to conceptualize and describe, but if you want
to play up the alienness of them, you’ll likely need to
make sure they have some dramatic social or cultural
difference, or some unique element of physiognomy.
Exotic aliens are built out of parts and materials
that aren’t normally found in Terran life forms. A humanoid might be composed out of a kind of organic plastic that makes up much of their home planet’s
biochemistry, or be composed of an intricate array of
interlocking crystals and woody organic elements. You
should pick one or more materials that aren’t normally
part of an animal’s body and have them play a major
role in the alien’s biology. As a consequence, this kind
of alien is probably highly dependent upon their home
world for food and other biological necessities. If not,
they likely spend a lot of effort synthesizing vital materials out of local supplies.
Hybrid aliens combine aspects of two or more of
the types described here, and you can mix and match
their components to create some blend that suits your
purposes. Such hybrids might exist in multiple environments, or be in a transitional evolutionary state.

204• ALIENS

Alien Psychology and Lenses

There are many different ways to fabricate a useful and
interesting alien race, ranging from careful development based on unique biologies or environments to
more abstract methods of defining interesting traits.
The method this section offers is intended to provide
a GM with a few tools for producing alien races that
feel sufficiently strange in play without leaving the GM
groping to figure out how a given alien would react to
a situation.
The first step is to understand that a Like alien race
is fundamentally human. They may be shaped differently, they may dwell in a radically different environment, but they think, feel, and desire largely as humans
do. Human vices and virtues almost certainly exist in
their society and they are susceptible to the same sort
of temptations and provocations that move humans. If
you want to know what an alien is like, the first thing
to do is to think of what a human is like.
The difference for aliens, however, is that they are
very strongly influenced by one or two emotional or
social traits, called Lenses. Everything about them, from
the way their society is structured to the way they deal
with strangers to the dreams they have for their own
future revolves around these Lenses. The result is an
alien culture that may not be deeply nuanced, but it is
a culture that is very easily remembered by players and
easily played by GMs. If you know that the two Lenses
for the alien race of Churq are Collectivity and Fear,
you know that a given Churq is going to be cowardly
and intensely social. Courageous individuality will be
noxious or incomprehensible to it and its social roles
will revolve around the safety of the collective against
the dreadful perils of the outside world.
Lenses should not be taken as the last word about
a species. GMs who want to spend more time on the
species’ psychology can elaborate as they wish, and all
of the guidelines given for a Lens can be easily adjusted
to whatever flavor the GM wishes to use. GMs can pick
or roll one or more Lenses from among the following
list, or generate their own as desired.

Collectivity
These aliens might be hive-like in their social structure,
natural communists, or simply very closely attached
to the customs and interests of their social group. The
importance of the individual is thought to be minimal,
and members will cheerfully and readily sacrifice themselves for the good of the group. To willfully refuse to
accept the consensus of the whole is an unspeakable
sin, and to be separated permanently from one’s social
group is a fate worse than death.
Curiosity
This species is insatiably curious, constantly prying into
the affairs of those around them. Spying for this race
carries no opprobrium whatsoever, and while they may
attempt to maintain privacy for certain doings, all assume it a given that matters will be discovered in the
end. They love to explore new places and meet new
sapients, and while they may be brutally indifferent to
the fates or treatment of these beings, they’re always
eager to observe them. Their societies tend to operate
in a profoundly transparent manner, and some view
the keeping of secrets as an automatic indication of
malicious intent.
Despair
These aliens have fallen prey to a pervasive sense of
failure and loss. Perhaps they are the remnants of a
once-glorious empire or the survivors of some cataclysmic disaster for their people. What they once loved
has been destroyed, and their sources of comfort and
courage have failed them. Superficially, they might resemble those species that crave pleasure and indulgence,
but their disports only serve to numb them to the existential gloom that taints the species. Their leadership
is desultory at best, and sophisticated social structures
tend to degrade into loose, diffident associations as
their members no longer have the hope necessary to
perpetuate them.
Domination
These aliens are consumed by a desire to conquer and
rule, both each other and any other species unfortunate
enough to share the stellar neighborhood. Some among
them can be fair and thoughtful rulers, but others are
nothing more than vainglorious tyrants. Among themselves, society tends to be organized in intricate and
clearly-marked hierarchies, with advancement progressing along both official and illicit routes. These
aliens constantly test their leaders, forcing them to
maintain their position through strength and cunning.
Faith
Such a species is driven by religious concerns, organizing their society around their faith and its clergy. Most
such species have a single faith. Others make do with a
number of different religions, all followed with a fierce
devotion. Challenges to this faith are not met with

ALIENS •205
outrage so much as blank incomprehension; for these
beings, the truth of their religions is so self-evident
that it seems irrational to ever question it. Those who
most perfectly embody the teachings of their creeds
tend to become rulers, their lives and will taken as an
example for others.
Fear
These aliens live in constant fear. They may be natives
of some lethal death-world, survivors of a species-annihilating cataclysm, or simply evolved from weak and
easily-devoured prey animals. The world is terrifying
to them, and their societies are based around hiding
or protecting themselves from these dreads. The most
revered members are those who are best hidden or
best protected, and who can give protection and concealment to their fellows. Most of these races are quite
cowardly by human measure, but occasionally they can
be driven into a frenzy of terror in which they fight
with the courage of the doomed.
Gluttony
These aliens devour. They are rapacious consumers,
whether it is of food, living space, energy, or some other resource. They will do almost anything to increase
access to this resource and are deeply indifferent to the
needs of other species, and often of their own fellows
as well. To consume greatly is glorious for this species,
with the greatest and most respected members being
those who have the greatest stockpiles of the resource
to consume, or who provide the most to their followers.
The purpose of existence is to eat, and all good things
are understood as different modes of devouring.
Greed
These aliens are enormously greedy. Status depends almost entirely upon personal wealth, and their lives are
spent in accumulating the greatest stores of value possible. Some focus on production, creating the wealth for
their own benefit, while others seek to make a profit on
trade. Some such greedy species have intricate property
laws to safeguard what is accumulated, while others
are little more than bandits among their own kind, too
avaricious to let law interfere with their greed.
Hate
There is something these aliens hate, and it defines
their culture completely by their opposition to it. It
may be these aliens are rampant xenophobes, loathing all who are not of their own kind. There may be
acrid religious or political divisions among them, with
individuals identifying completely with their sect and
despising all the others. It could be an ancient enemy
among the stars, a rival race that has wounded them
so greatly as to be unforgivable. These aliens may spar
and maneuver for power among their own kind, but all
goals and individuals are to some degree subordinated
to the needs of their immortal hate.

Honor
Whatever sort of society the race has, it is one obsessed
with honorable behavior. Members will obey the social
mores and expectations of their roles at all costs. Personal sacrifice for the sake of upholding these principles
earns a member glory and esteem. Gaining advantage
by means of inappropriate behavior or failing in one’s
duty is shameful, and an entity that has compromised
its honor too greatly may prefer death to continued
existence.
Journeying
This species has an incurable wanderlust. Perhaps they
roam the stars in fleets of massive spike drive ships, or
they may make steady circuits of the nearby stars to
connect their worlds and exchange people among them.
More technologically primitive species might sail the
waves of alien seas or make nomadic journeys across
the continents of their world. Few of these aliens can
ever be happy in remaining in one place for long, and
they are forever scouting new worlds and new lands
simply for the pleasure of being there a little while.
Joy
These aliens are relentless bon vivants, constantly in
pursuit of pleasure and enjoyable excitement. Beauty,
grace, and the inspiration of passion are their highest virtues. Those who produce the most exquisite art
or inspire the most extravagant delight have effective
rule over their fellows, though such species tend to be
loosely-organized at best. The brute necessities of life
are acknowledged as a necessity, but their societies are
willing to sacrifice a great deal of efficiency and practicality for the sake of immediate satisfaction.
Pacifism
The race is remarkably peaceful and nonviolent in
nature. Few species survive while being totally averse
to violent self-defense, but this race will never choose
violence against living creatures as a means of gaining
advantage or retaliating to wrongs. Among their own
kind, violence is abhorrent and unnatural, and it is
probable that the species is either herbivorous or subsists by photosynthesis. A pacifist race may be peaceful, but there are more ways to do injury than through
personal violence; the cession of trade, the destruction
of property, and the incitement of divisions and confusion among their enemies are all tools this race knows
well. Pacifist species can also be quite oppressive at
times, with an underclass constitutionally incapable
of defending their possessions or privileges with force.
Pride
These aliens are suffused with an enormous pride in
their own culture and species, and instinctively consider themselves to be superior to the lesser beings they
may encounter. A prideful species is not necessarily a
hostile one; some such races have a certain sense of

206• ALIENS
noblesse oblige toward their “lessers”, and some species’
pride shows in a resolute refusal to lower themselves
to deceit, cruelty, or avarice. More often, however, this
pride manifests in a casual contempt for the interests of
their inferiors, and a single-minded focus on personal
advancement and glory among their own kind.
Sagacity
These aliens love intellectual pursuits above all others.
Logic, wisdom, and erudition are all prized as the best
and most glorious expressions of their nature, and their
rulers are invariably sage-kings of remarkable depth
and breadth of understanding. Such understanding
does not necessarily stand in well for good judgment,
and sagacious alien civilizations are notorious for overreaching in their ambitions. Stupidity and ignorance
are moral failings to this race, and some of them treat
very harshly those species that they do not feel to be
their intellectual peers.
Subtlety
Such a species is enormously cunning and patient in
character, willing to endure years of suffering calmly
in order to bring about some intricate plan. They shun
open display of emotions or opinions, masking such
things behind protocols of bland correctness. To reveal
one’s true opinion about some contentious matter is
a mark either of profound trust or a sign of obvious
incipient treachery. The true ruler of such a species is
almost never who it seems to be.
Tradition
This species devoutly reveres the past and the ways of
their ancestors. Social interactions are stiffly ritualized,
and society is ornate with the customs, traditions, and
habits of their forebears. Innovations of any kind are
viewed with deep suspicion, and the most favored solutions to problems are those which have been employed
before. Members of this species are intensely uncomfortable when forced to exercise their own judgment,

and doing so in contravention to the past is almost impossible for them. Only when faced with a completely
novel situation is any degree of personal initiative likely
to be shown, and even in that case, the alien will try to
reconcile it to some existing tradition.
Treachery
This species is uniformly treacherous and untrustworthy. Bargains and agreements are kept only so long
as they are useful to both participants, and truthfulness
is simply a tool to be placed next to deceit. There is
no sense of acrimony or anger among these aliens at
the inevitable betrayals that make up their societies;
they consider it good and laudable that an individual should seek its own best interests, and those who
can most perfectly manipulate each other are naturally
those most worthy to rule, for the health of the society
directly influences the power of its head.
Tribalism
The aliens are fiercely tribal, divided up into myriad
small groups that are as often at war with each other
as they are cooperating. Such tribes tend to be built
along familial lines, though some tribes are volitional in
nature, representing different political or philosophical
groups. A given alien’s loyalty is to its tribe before its
species, and it is not uncommon for their enemies to
use one group against another.
Wrath
The race is hot-tempered, prone to fits of personal violence. Disputes are settled by force, though rarely to
the point of death among their own kind. Outsiders
can expect swift and bloody retaliation for any insult
or slight, and the prospect of death rarely intimidates
these beings. Their chief mode of emotional expression
is anger; wrath at obstacles, fury at enemies, and a slow
smoldering burn when neither are available.

Alien Social Structure

Once the Lenses for a species are chosen, you’ll need
to establish a few important facts about the aliens. You
need to make some decisions about their social structure, the goals of their leadership, their relationship
with humanity, and the sort of examples that the PCs
are likely to encounter.
Determining the social structure for the aliens can
be done by answering a few basic questions and elaborating outward from the answers to whatever degree of
detail you find useful or enjoyable. In most cases, whatever social structure you hit on will apply only to those
aliens in a specific sector. Far-flung races might have
wildly different modes of rule among their different
fragments, assuming that biological necessity doesn’t
push them to certain kinds of societies.
First, decide how the species is ruled. You can roll
randomly on the table below, or simply pick something
that seems appropriate.
d8

Social Structure

1

Democratic

2

Monarchic

3

Tribal

4

Oligarchic

5-6

Multipolar Competitive

7-8

Multipolar Cooperative

Democratic: The species has a broadly democratic organization, with individual members having a
formal say in the choice of leadership. This voting need not necessarily be based on numbers; it
might be a vote with money, military power, religious influence, possession of certain biological
traits, or any other metric that makes sense to the
aliens. Whatever the specific currency, politics
for this race tends to revolve around persuasion
and diplomacy rather than use of military force to
determine species-wide policies.
Monarchic: The species is ruled by a single being, with
such rule justified by custom, biological imperative, divine mandate, personal influence, or familial ties. Such monarchic societies almost invariably
have a “noble” caste of some kind to act as administrators and officials for the monarch, and they usually make up the pool from which new monarchs
are chosen. The specific title for a monarch will
usually depend on the justification for their rule:
Chieftain, Emperor, Broodmother, High Priest,
Dictator, Chief Elder, or so forth.
Tribal: The species is organized into multiple tribes
based on lineage, philosophy, or geographical location. Tribes set their own laws and policies, and
are prone to intense internal struggles over resources and status. There may exist a “paramount
tribe” that inflicts its will upon the others through

brute strength or traditional esteem. Tribal leaders tend to be personally distinguished, and usually have earned their position through personal
accomplishments and the broad support of their
tribemates.
Oligarchic: The species is led by a number of powerful
or revered figures who work in nominal harmony.
Individual oligarchs might have their own goals,
but no single member has the strength to enforce
its will upon the whole. These oligarchs might be
the product of hereditary inheritance, or individual members of the species might one day aspire
to join their numbers.
Multipolar: The species has more than one leadership
organization. Roll 1d6; on a 1-2 it has two, 3-4
indicates three, and 5-6 indicates four. Roll on
this table the requisite number of times to determine the nature of these organizations. Some such
multipolar institutions operate in parallel; a tribal
organization headed by one gender, for example,
that determines the division of goods while a
monarchic head of a different gender makes decisions about the race’s relations with other species.
Others are directly in conflict, such as a monarchy
struggling against a democratic neighbor.
Once you’ve determined the type of leadership
the species favors, you can sort out any important
details about their social structures. By default, you
should assume that the aliens have some sort of analog for any job or role that humans find necessary.
The Churq might be cowardly collectivists, but even
they need plumbers, soldiers, and tax collectors. You
can take whatever human society suits you as the base
template and then interpret the relevant roles through
the Lenses you’ve picked for the species.
For example, if the Churq have the Lenses of Fear
and Collectivism, their tax collectors might be honored exemplars of communal redistribution, judiciously
taking from those who have excess in order to give to
those who have less. The Churq gladly offer resources
to the tax collector, because the offering proves that
they producing excess resources, which proves to them
that they are secure and safe in their plenty. A Churq
who fails to produce for the collective suffers gnawing
terror at the idea of dangerous scarcity and will redouble its effort to contribute to the group.
Conversely, Churq soldiers might invariably be
found in small groups, as an individual Churq is incapable of fighting effectively without the encouragement
and safety of their brethren around them. They might
specialize in terror attacks against enemy civilians, their
intimate acquaintance with fear encouraging them to
use it as a weapon against their enemies… their unarmed, noncombatant enemies, preferably. A war between Churq collectives might never have a single open
battle, but instead a sequence of ambushes and terror
attacks until one collective loses its nerve and submits.

208• ALIENS

Alien Technology

Alien races tend to come in two different technological
flavors. Some are quite technologically primitive, either
through being too new to sapience to have had time
to develop scientific arts, or because they are unfortunate enough to inhabit a very resource-poor world.
Such aliens might demonstrate remarkable ingenuity
in making the most of their surroundings, but some
worlds make advancement prohibitively difficult for
a species.
Other aliens possess spike drives, advanced weaponry, fusion power, and all the other ornaments of a
sophisticated star-faring civilization. These aliens are
usually the remnants of a more expansionistic period,
colonies and outposts that have evolved into homeworlds for the survivors of the civilization. This golden age is normally terminated by some kind of species-wide disaster, whether natural in nature or the
result of savage internal warfare. These worlds are
usually too absorbed in their own affairs or ennui to
have much interest in expansion.
Most advanced aliens have tech roughly equivalent
to human TL4, though they’re often slightly superior
in some areas while being somewhat worse in others.
A few old, sophisticated races have the equivalent of
TL5, though these species often produce devices and
artifacts that are difficult for humans to use effectively.
A handful of alien worlds show technology that is simply impossible for humanity to replicate at any known
tech level, with artifices and creations that seem more
magic than mundane science.

Aliens in the Sector

What role do these aliens play in the sector? Do they
have their own sector homeworld, dominated by them
and their kind, or do they instead live in enclaves on
a human-ruled world? Do they live in orbital habitats,
or convoys of massive spike drive ships? You should
place the species according to your needs, preferably in
a location that the players can be expected to eventually
experience.
You should also make a few quick decisions about
how these aliens are generally treated by humans, and

how they treat humans in turn. Some dangerous or
obnoxious species might be unable to function in human societies, while others might be normal citizens
on a sophisticated pan-racial planet. Some beings might
be horrific or repellent to humans through no fault of
their own, and subject to persecution by those who
live around their “alien ghettos”. Such aliens are likely to respond to the misuse much as humans might,
albeit in ways strongly influenced by their Lenses. A
Wrathful species might respond with brutal violence
toward persecutors, while Joyful ones might try to win
their tormentors over by demonstrating the beauty and
delight they can bring to their friends.

Alien Motivation

Individual aliens are likely to have as wide and varying a set of motivations as any human. Alien governments and ruling institutions, however, are liable to
have more specific goals. Acquiring a new homeworld,
ensuring the suppression of would-be pogromchiks,
vengeance against a hated world or species, or any other such long-term goal would be suitable for an alien
government.
The broad goals of an alien government are usually
obvious, but the subtle plans and maneuvers they use to
accomplish these purposes can be less clear. PC groups
can be commissioned by alien officials to perform acts
or retrieve objects that have no immediate relevance,
only to discover later that they played a crucial role in
some enigmatic gambit. By the same token, they might
stumble across some alien operation that has no obvious purpose, earning bitter enmity for their disruption
of plans they never knew existed.
In either case, there should usually be some way
for the PCs to discover alien motivations, in the case
that they actually care. It can be prohibitively difficult
to negotiate with such beings without understanding
their desires, and parties with little appetite for combat
may be frustrated if they find their would-be counter-parties acting in an impenetrably obscure way. Some
adventures might revolve heavily around the challenge
of understanding an alien power’s true goals and the
steps they’re willing to take to achieve them.

ALIEN PLAYER CHARACTERS •209

ALIEN PLAYER CHARACTERS
If a GM decides to allow players to play members of an
alien race, she’s going to need to do a little extra work.
Each alien race is represented by a focus; to become
a member of that race, the player spends their initial
focus pick on choosing that origin. They then get the
natural benefits of belonging to that alien species.
As a general rule, the GM should pick two of the
following benefits to make up an alien’s origin focus, or
three if a couple of them are relatively minor perks. If
the Vree-Tak are a Proud Warrior Race of aliens, they
might have both an Aptitude for Violence, for example,
and an Origin Skill related to combat.
It’s also possible to apply particular weaknesses to
an alien species as compared to a human baseline. Such
weaknesses are rarely a significant game-balance consideration for PCs, however, as it’s common for players
to choose such alien races and then select classes and
roles that are unhindered by the species’ flaws. If you
want to use a flaw as a game-balance tool in a species,
make sure it’s broad enough to hinder a wide range of
concepts, and not just disqualify a few roles.
Aptitude for Violence
All members of this species are good at hurting things.
They gain a +1 bonus to their normal attack bonus.
Thus, a 1st level alien Expert would have an attack bonus of +1 instead of +0, and a 1st level Warrior would
begin with a +2 bonus.
Environmental Native
As a minor perk, the alien is able to survive in a relatively common hostile environment, such as underwater,
in hard vacuum, amid lethal radiation, or so forth. If the
alien requires this environment, it’s no net benefit at all.
Innate Ability
All members of this species have one or more natural
abilities beyond those possessed by humans. Perfect vision in the dark, tracking by scent, wireless tech interfacing, a lack of need for food and water, or some other
talent might apply. As a quick inspiration, you can look
at the equipment or cyberware list and give them the
natural use of 2-3 items. Optionally, you might give
them an ability equivalent to a single psionic technique,
plus one point of Effort to fuel it if needed.
Natural Defenses
The creature has a hard shell or sharp talons. The alien
has a base Armor Class of 15 plus half their character
level, rounded up. If you give them body weaponry
such as claws or fangs, have it equivalent to a medium advanced weapon. Weaponry alone is a very small
advantage, since it’s so easy to acquire otherwise, so
you might not count this as a benefit if all you give a
creature is a sharp set of teeth.

Origin Skill
All members of the species are particularly good at
something. They might all be capable warriors, have
unique technical aptitude, be persuasive speakers, or
otherwise have a shared knack. Receive an appropriate
skill as a bonus. Warrior-type races might be allowed
to pick from either Punch, Shoot, or Stab.
Psychic Aptitude
These aliens are all psychically gifted. The PC must
either be a Psychic or take the Partial Psychic class option from the Adventurer class. Their maximum Effort
score is increased by one point.
Shapeshifting
The alien is either an amoeboid blob that can manipulate objects with extruded pseudopods and flow
through small spaces, or it can actually mimic other
species or objects. The former trait is a minor benefit
at best, but the latter one might be sufficient to mimic
biopsionic shapeshifting, or might have a more restricted range of possible shapes.
Strong Attribute
All members of the species are strong, fast, tough, clever, perceptive, or charming by human standards. Pick
an attribute appropriate to the alien; that attribute
gains a +1 bonus to its modifier, up to a maximum of
+3. Thus, an alien from an exceptionally strong species
with a Strength score of 10 would have a Strength modifier of +1 instead of +0.
Tough
The alien is big, or hardy, or made of unusually durable
biological components. Whenever they roll their hit
dice to determine their maximum hit points, the first
die they roll always counts as the maximum. Thus, a
first level Warrior alien would always start with 8 hit
points. When rolling hit points at second level, they’d
count their first die as 8 and roll on from there. Further
hit dice that roll a 1 are rerolled.
Unusual Movement Mode
The alien can fly under normal gravity conditions, or
make short-range teleportation hops, or can climb
sheer walls as if they were flat. Whatever the details,
they can use their Move action to travel unusually.
Useful Immunity
The alien is impervious to some threat that’s relatively
common. A significant or common immunity, such as
against bullets, lasers, edged melee weapons or the like
would be a major benefit, while immunity to minor
threats such as toxins, diseases, radiation, or falling
damage might only qualify as a minor perk.
