FACTIONS
Interstellar merchant combines, tyrannical planetary
empires, sinister cults of eugenic perfection… groups
such as these all have a role to play in Stars Without
Number. Such organized, motivated groups are known
as factions, and this chapter describes ways in which a
GM can use them to further events in a sector. Player
characters that attain sufficient power and fame might
even establish their own factions, and the rules below
give ways to handle inter-faction fighting and the advancement of each group’s goals.

Using Factions in Your Game

The faction system in Stars Without Number is intended
to provide a GM with a constant stream of background
activity, adventure hooks, and visible setting reactions
to PC actions. It is an optional system, one that a GM
can take or leave as their own campaign suggests, but
it can provide an interested GM with tools to simplify
the business of running the campaign’s background.
The faction system is not meant to be a standalone game that doesn’t require GM involvement. It’s
not balanced for equivalence between sides, isn’t designed to incentivize optimal play choices, and some
situations will certainly require a GM to referee them.
The system is, however, built to produce the kind of
output that a working GM is likely to find most useful.
Some GMs will have no use for a formalized faction system. These people feel most comfortable simply dictating the outcome of conflicts and ambitions
among the assorted groups and organizations in their
campaign. When two groups clash, the results will be
determined by what the GM thinks is most reasonable.
This is a perfectly valid way of doing things, and
indeed, when a GM decides how some off-stage organization interacts with a fully-statted faction they’re
going to have to make calls like that anyway. Yet the
disadvantages of such a method are twofold.
First, it lacks surprise for the GM. By definition,
the reasonable thing always happens, and even the
occasional randomizer tossed in produces results that
are to some degree predictable to the GM. History and
current affairs are full of wildly unlikely-seeming outcomes, however, and sometimes the GM can benefit
by seeing a genuinely shocking result percolate out of
some conflict. Even in the absence of the adventure
hooks such surprises create, not knowing exactly how
her campaign is going to shake out helps keep a GM
interested in events.
Second, an unstructured system has few prompts
to goad a GM into thinking of unexpected interactions
between factions. A GM simply provided with a list of
NPC groups to write events for will tend to reach for
the interactions and outcomes that are foremost in their
mind, implicitly going along with assumptions about
how things should play out. If instead they’re handed a

slow-burn struggle between a militant terrorist group
with fanatical zealots for an asset and a eugenics-loving
religion with a crack team of lawyers, they’re going to
think somewhat harder about how these two factions
might play out their conflict, and will get results that
don’t automatically feed their assumptions.
One of the easiest ways to use the faction system
is as a news chyron for your campaign. After each faction turn, you can boil down events to a few sentences
apiece and hand them to your players at the start of the
next gaming session, letting them know what’s on the
news channels and underground gossip boards of your
campaign. If your players get excited about one of the
events, you can dedicate the next downtime between
sessions to brewing up an adventure related to their
efforts at involvement.
Another use of the system is as a way to formalize
the setting reaction to PC actions. If the last adventure involved the PCs utterly discrediting the leader
of a political party you’re using as a faction, you might
scratch off the Demagogue asset that the party had that
represented that leader. A quick scribble gives you the
news crawl next session telling the PCs that the leader
had decided to step down to spend more time with
her family.
The factions you write up are not the only organizations and groups in your world, but they are the ones
the PCs are most likely to care about or the ones most
pertinent to their current activities. You don’t need to
keep the same factions active all the time; if the campaign shifts focus halfway across the sector, you can
simply freeze the local factions until the PCs get back in
their zone of relevance. If you have the spare time and
effort, you might even keep them running, letting the
PCs discover how things shook out when and if they
ever get back to that region of space.
In time, the PCs themselves can start creating their
own factions to contend with rivals and seek influence
on a scale impractical for a lone wanderer. While PC
factions use all the same rules and faction turn actions
as NPC ones, they have the tremendous advantage of
being the focus of a veteran adventuring party’s helpful
interest. Almost anything that can be accomplished by
faction turn actions can be done more quickly by the
appropriate PC adventures.
This, of course, is an easy way for a GM to let the
players write their own adventure content. So long as
the PCs care about their pet factions or allied groups,
their own ambitions and desire to help will practically
create whole sessions worth of adventure outlines for
you. Important NPCs in rival groups will become hated
nemeses, hostile assets will become the targets of their
bad intent, and the players will constantly be on the
lookout for ways to augment their allies. For the sake
of your own time and effort, you should let them.

212• FACTIONS, ASSETS, AND TURNS

FACTIONS, ASSETS, AND TURNS
A faction is any group that you intend to use as an important actor in the sector. In theory, any organization
could qualify as a faction; every planetary government,
business, religion, or club could be described with the
rules given here. Still, that kind of exhaustive cataloging is neither practical nor profitable. Faction status
should be reserved for those organizations that will do
things important to the PCs or the background world.
You should not bother creating more factions for your
game than you are actually using at that moment. Save
your effort for the groups that count.
It may be necessary to turn an organization into a
faction in the course of play. If the PCs suddenly take a
deep interest in a eugenic cult they recently faced on the
jungle moon of Perihelion, it might be useful for the
GM to turn the group into a formal faction, the better
to understand how the PCs might injure it and what
resources the cult might have to fight back. Or it might
be that the PC group’s interstellar trading cartel faction
tries to topple a world’s tyrannical government, thus
making it worthwhile to define the tyrant’s resources.
As a general rule, you shouldn’t have more than
five or six factions at the start of your campaign, and
fewer is quite possible. Fewer than three tend to make
for too much stability, however, and might not generate enough activity to make for interesting news
reports and adventure hooks. Possible factions in a
campaign might include criminal groups, local religions, planetary governments, political movements,
terrorist organizations, noble houses, or any other
band that might conceivably be someone the players
care about or some group that might possibly hire or
oppose the PCs.

Defining a Faction

Factions have attributes consisting of six statistics, a
homeworld, and one or more tags.
Hit points measure a faction’s cohesion, morale,
and group unity. The higher a faction’s hit points, the
harder it is to break it up. A faction that loses hit points
has lost cohesion somehow, either through the death
of leadership, the demoralization of members, or the
rise of fractious power blocs inside its structure. A faction needs time to recover from hit point damage. A
faction’s maximum hit points are based on its Force,
Cunning, and Wealth, as given later in the chapter.
Force rating is the faction’s general aptitude at applying physical violence, measured on a scale ranging
from 1 to 8. A rating of 1 implies an organization with
little or no aptitude for physical coercion, while a rating
of 8 might be appropriate for a regional hegemon with
a powerful, expansionist military. A high Force rating
doesn’t necessarily mean that the faction has much in
the way of a standing army, but it does mean that the
faction can think clearly about the use of force and is

accustomed to military reasoning. Governments tend
to have high Force ratings to represent police forces
and military structures. Terrorist groups, mercenary
bands, and other organizations that rely on brute violence also tend to have high Force ratings.
Cunning rating reflects the faction’s skills at espionage, infiltration, internal security, and covert
manipulation of other groups. A rating of 1 implies a
completely visible faction with no resources for resisting infiltration, while a rating of 8 implies a faction of
Illuminati unknown to all but a handful of paranoid
conspiracy-mongers with tendrils of influence reaching to the farthest star in the sector. Eugenics cults, terrorist groups, spy agencies, and some religious groups
tend to favor a good Cunning score.
Wealth rating indicates the faction’s commercial,
scientific, and industrial resources. A Wealth score of
1 means that the faction has little in the way of income
or investments, no dedicated manufacturing facilities,
and no laboratories or researchers available. A Wealth
score of 8 is appropriate for some system-spanning
merchant empire or the combine that runs the pretech
manufactories of an untouched factory world.
FacCreds are a measure of the faction’s general
wealth and resources, spent to purchase and maintain assets or carry out faction operations. A FacCred
doesn’t necessarily represent a certain sum of credits so
much as it represents logistics capability, available resources, and managerial focus. A faction on a primitive
world may not have a single credit to its name, but its
command of a legion of laborers and the food supplies
necessary to feed them are a vast store of FacCreds all
the same. All the credits in a sector do no good if they
can’t be effectively translated into a useful asset.
Factions also accumulate experience points. They
gain these points from accomplishing goals, with the
larger goals earning them correspondingly more experience points. Once enough experience is accumulated
the faction can spend it to improve a rating. The higher
the rating, the more experience is necessary to raise it.
It’s vastly more difficult to go from Force 7 to 8 than
from Force 1 to 2.
The faction’s homeworld represents the location
of its core leadership and support. Factions can always
purchase assets and take actions on their homeworld,
even if they lack any other assets there. By the same
token, an enemy can always launch attacks against the
faction on their homeworld if the enemy is able to
move in its own assets.
Tags are special traits that relate to the faction’s
nature or special aptitudes. A cabal of rebel conspirators might have the Secretive tag, which gives a bonus
to resisting certain attacks, or Deep Roots, which gives
them a bonus to operations on their homeworld. Most
factions have one or two tags.

FACTIONS, ASSETS, AND TURNS •213

Faction Assets

Aside from the six statistics, faction also possess assets.
Assets are facilities, contacts, trained units of specialists,
or other specific objects, places, or groups of value. A
regiment of postech infantry is an asset, as is a pretech
manufactory, a master assassin, or an interstellar shipping company.
Assets require certain ratings to support. A fleet
of capital warships isn’t going to be useful to a faction
with Force 3 no matter how much wealth the faction
has. It just doesn’t have the infrastructure and institutional mindset to use such an asset effectively.
Assets have hit points much like factions do. An asset reduced to zero hit points by an attack is destroyed;
either physically ruined, hopelessly scattered, totally
demoralized, or lost to a rival buyer. Asset hit points
can be regained with time for repair, reorganization, or
culling members suborned by other powers.
Assets have a purchase cost and sometimes a maintenance cost, paid in FacCreds. The first turn that a
faction fails to pay the maintenance cost of an asset, it
becomes unavailable for use. If the maintenance cost
isn’t paid the next turn, the asset is lost.
Assets often have an Attack. When an asset is used
to strike at another faction, the attack entry is used to
determine what rating is attacked and the amount of
hit point damage that is done by a successful hit. An
asset without an Attack entry can’t be used to initiate
a strike at an enemy faction.
A Counterattack line indicates the damage an asset
does to an unsuccessful attacker. If an attacking asset
misses its strike against the target, the target’s Counterattack entry damage is done. An asset without a Counterattack entry does no damage to a failed attacker. It’s
quite possible to have an asset with no Attack but a
powerful Counterattack, making it useless at offense
but very dangerous to assault.
Assets have a type, such as “Special Forces”, “Military Unit”, “Facility”, “Starship” or the like. This type
is mostly relevant when factions wish to upgrade an
asset, or some special tag applies only to assets of a
certain type.
Assets have a location, usually the planet on which
they were purchased, though it might also be a deepspace habitat, a particular moon, or some other general
geographical location. Assets cannot be used against
different locations unless they are first transported
there, usually by means of a logistical asset.
Most assets also require a particular tech level to
purchase. They can be transported to worlds with lower tech levels, but they must be purchased on a planet
with a sufficient level of technology.
A faction may own no more assets of a particular
type than they have points in the relevant rating. Thus,
a faction with Force 3 can own three Force assets. In a
pinch, a faction can exceed this total, but each asset over
the maximum costs an additional FacCred in maintenance each turn.

The Faction Turn

Faction actions are divided up by turns. As a rule of
thumb, a faction turn happens once per month, or once
after each adventure. Turns might happen more or less
often depending on the GM’s preferred pace of events.
Each faction can usually take one action per turn.
At the beginning of each turn, roll a die that’s no
smaller than the number of factions you have. Thus, if
you’ve got six factions in the sector, roll a d6. If you’ve
got nine, roll a d10, and so forth. Whatever number
comes up is the faction that acts first; thus, if you roll
a 4, the fourth faction on your list acts first. Then the
one after it, and the one after that, and so forth, rolling
over the top of the list when necessary.
At the beginning of each turn, a faction gains FacCreds equal to half their Wealth rating rounded up plus
one-quarter of their total Force and Cunning ratings,
rounded down. Any maintenance costs must be paid
at the beginning of each turn. Assets that cannot be
maintained are unusable; an asset that goes without
maintenance for two consecutive rounds is lost. A faction cannot voluntarily choose not to pay maintenance.
If a faction has no goal at the start of a turn, they
may pick a new one. If they wish to abandon a prior
goal, they may do so, but the demoralization and confusion costs them that turn’s FacCred income and they
may perform no other action that turn.
At the end of each faction turn, the GM should
translate the turn’s events into a few lines of rumor or
news that can be related to the PCs. A successful attack
by the Lawyers of the Bright Dawn Guild on the Perihelion government’s Union Toughs might be reported
as “Neohuman rights activists on Perihelion applaud
the election of Parminder Smith to the leadership of the
government-sponsored Transit Workers Union. Miss
Smith is a strong supporter of neohuman research and
legal emancipation.”

Acting During A Turn

Factions can take several different types of actions,
though generally only one action per turn. The list
provided consists of the usual actions a faction might
find useful; you should feel free to allow variations on
the list depending on the particular situation. PC adventures always exist outside of the faction turn economy. If you run an adventure involving the PC group’s
destruction of the Sorority of the Golden Flame’s secret
laboratories on a volcanic planetoid, then the faction’s
asset is simply destroyed, with no chance of resisting.
A faction can only take one type of action per round,
but they can perform that action on as many worlds as
they wish. A faction that selects the Attack action, for
example, can launch attacks on multiple worlds, while
one that selects the Use Asset Ability action can use the
special abilities of any or all assets they possess. This
limit on the type of action allowed in a round tends
to slow down events, allowing for the more gradual
development of situations in play.

214• FACTION ACTIONS

FACTION ACTIONS
The following list of actions includes the most common activities a faction might choose to perform. The
GM should feel free to add new action types, or allow
alternate choices if a faction wishes to do something
that doesn’t quite fit the list below. As a rule, a faction
should only be able to do one thing per turn, but should
be able to do that same thing with any or all assets.
Attack: Attacking is the chief way by which a faction
assaults a rival’s assets and organizational structure. A successful attack can damage or destroy an
enemy asset, or even damage the leadership and
cohesion of an enemy faction. It’s up to the GM
or players to describe an attack and its methods.
Attacks can only be launched against known
assets. If a rival has stealthed assets on a world,
they cannot be targeted for an attack until they’ve
been discovered by a faction’s intelligence agents.
Attacks can only be launched against assets on the
same world as the attacker.
To launch an attack, the attacker selects one
or more of their own assets and targets a rival faction with assets on the same world. One at a time,
each attacking asset is matched against a defending
asset chosen by the defender. Each attacking asset
can attack only once per turn, though a defending
asset can defend as many times as the defender
wishes, assuming it can survive multiple conflicts.
Once matched, the attacker rolls 1d10 and
adds the relevant attribute for the asset. For example, a military unit’s Attack might add the faction’s
Force rating to the attack roll, while a cyberninja
unit might add the faction’s Cunning to the attack
roll. The defender then rolls 1d10 and adds the
attribute that the attack targets. In the instance of
the military unit, this might be an attack against
Force, causing the defender to add their Force
rating to the roll, while defending against the
cyberninjas might require adding the defender’s
Cunning rating. The Attack line of the attacking
asset indicates which attribute to add to the attack
roll and which to add to the defense roll.
If the attacker’s roll exceeds the defender’s roll,
the attack is a success. The defending asset suffers
damage as given on the Attack line of the attacking
asset. If the defender has a Base of Influence on the
world, the defender may opt to let the damage bypass the asset and hit the Base of Influence instead,
causing damage to it and the faction hit points. If
the asset or Base of Influence is reduced to zero
hit points, it is lost.
If the attacker’s roll is less than the defender’s
roll, the attack fails. The defending asset can apply
whatever damage their Counterattack line indicates to the attacking asset. If the defending asset

has no Counterattack line, the attacker suffers no
consequences for the failed attack.
A tie on the roll results in both Attack and
Counterattack succeeding. Both attacker and defender take damage as indicated.
Buy Asset: The faction buys one asset on their homeworld or another planet on which they have a
Base of Influence. These assets take time to assemble, and can neither attack, defend, nor grant
their special benefits until the beginning of the
faction’s next turn. The faction must have a sufficient rating to buy an asset, and the planet must
have a tech level sufficient to support the asset’s
creation. Only one asset can be purchased by a
faction per turn.
Change Homeworld: A faction can move to a different
homeworld, if they have a Base of Influence on
the destination planet. This action takes one turn,
plus one more for each hex of distance between
the old homeworld and the new. During this time
the faction can initiate no actions.
Expand Influence: The faction buys a Base of Influence
asset on a planet on which they have at least one
other asset. The faction then rolls 1d10+Cunning
rating against similar rolls by every other faction
on the planet. Any of the others that equal or
beat the faction’s roll may make a free immediate Attack action against the Base of Influence if
they wish. Other assets present on the planet may
defend against the attack as normal. The Base of
Influence cannot be used until the beginning of
the faction’s next turn.
To buy a Base of Influence, the purchaser pays
one FacCred for every hit point the base has, up
to a maximum equal to the faction’s maximum
hit points. Bases with few hit points are relatively
peripheral outposts, easy to dislodge but cheap to
erect. Bases with many hit points are significant
strongholds that would hurt the faction badly to
lose but are much harder to eliminate.
Factions may use this action to buy additional
hit points for a Base of Influence, paying one additional FacCred up to the maximum HP allowed. It
is possible to decrease a base’s hit points with the
action as well, albeit without refunds. The base on
a faction’s homeworld cannot be shrunk this way.
Refit Asset: Change one asset to any other asset of the
same type. If the new asset is of a more expensive
type, pay the difference. The asset must be on a
planet that allows the purchase of the new asset.
Turning a militia squad into elite skirmishers
requires a tech level 4 world and governmental
permission, for example. A refitted asset is unable to attack or defend until the beginning of the
faction’s next turn.

FACTION ACTIONS •215
Repair Asset/Faction: Heal damage to an asset or faction.
For one FacCred, an asset heals points of damage
equal to the faction’s score in its ruling attribute.
More damage can be healed in this single action,
but the cost of repair increases by one FacCred
for each further amount repaired- two FacCreds
for the second amount healed, three FacCreds for
the third amount healed, et cetera. If used to heal
a faction, the faction regains hit points equal to
the rounded average of its highest and lowest attribute ratings. This healing cannot be hurried by
additional spending. Use of this action allows the
faction to heal as many different assets as it wishes.
Sell Asset: Gain half the FacCred cost of the asset,
rounded down.
Seize Planet: The faction seeks to become the ruling
body of a world. The faction must destroy all
unstealthed assets on the planet belonging to factions who oppose their attempt before they can
successfully take control. If all the assets cannot be
destroyed in one turn, the faction must continue
the attempt next turn until either successful or all
of their own assets on that planet have been destroyed or have left the planet. No other actions
can be taken in the meanwhile. Once all resistance
has been crushed, the attacker must maintain at
least one unstealthed asset on the world for three
turns. If successful, they gain the Planetary Government tag for the world.
Use Asset Ability: Use the special abilities of one or
more assets, such as the transport ability of logistics assets, or the intelligence-gathering abilities
of spy assets.

Handling Special Cases

When in doubt, a GM should simply make a judgment
based on their own best sense of the situation. Despite
this general case, there are a few more particular situations that come up often enough to bear some specific
guidance in handling them.
Sometimes, a ground unit will choose to attack
a starship unit, or some other unit that seems to be
beyond their reach. As a general rule, you should allow
this, and simply decide how it was that the ground unit
was able to cause problems for the starships. Maybe
they subverted officers, or sabotaged support facilities,
or drove logistical suppliers out of business.
Some assets require the permission of the planetary government to raise them on a particular world or
move them into that world’s system. The necessity of
this will depend on how advanced the planetary government is and how direct the contact. A TL2 planetary
government probably wouldn’t even notice the arrival
of a capital fleet in their star system, let alone be able
to do anything to prevent it. Even so, native lawyers,
bribed offworlder officials, and hired mercenaries
might still be able to harass a force the locals couldn’t
bar from entering their territory.

Locations are considered general to a specific star
system rather than a particular world. The faction’s
marketers might be operating out of the planetary capital, but for purposes of location, they’re as much in the
system as a Scavenger Fleet floating around the rim.
Getting shuttles to and from wherever they need to go
inside the system is not a problem for most factions.
Sometimes two factions will want to merge for
some reason. The efficiency of this will depend on how
much the factions like each other and how close they
are in function; give this propinquity a rating from 1,
for two factions that hate each other and don’t do similar things at all, to 9, for two factions that are in perfect
synchrony. Use 6 for two factions of average similarity.
Whenever you need to see how well the merger went,
roll a compatibility check; 1d10 versus this number. If
the roll is equal or less, it worked, and if it’s higher, the
merger didn’t work so well in that regard.
Now determine the Force, Wealth, and Cunning
ratings for the new faction. For each one, roll a compatibility check; on a success, use the higher of the two
factions’ scores, while on a failure, use the lower one.
For each asset, roll a compatibility check; on a success, the asset belongs to the new faction, on a failure,
it’s forcibly sold. FacCreds are totaled between the two
factions, and the merged faction gets all the Bases of
Influence each originally had. Pick a new goal as well.
If the faction has assets its new ratings can’t support, it
keeps them, but can’t use Repair Asset on them.
PC adventures always overrule faction die rolls.
If the PCs undertake an adventure which results in
the crippling or destruction of a hostile faction’s asset,
that asset is destroyed without any need for dice. In
the same vein, if they swoop in to rescue some asset
that the dice declared was ruined and undertake an adventure that plausibly salvages the situation, that asset
comes back into existence. The faction system is built
to help create adventure hooks, not shut them down.
By the same token, if a PC adventure seems to
plausibly create an asset for a faction, then that should
be credited to the group. It is entirely in your interest
as a GM to let the players plot out adventure goals and
find motivation in helping a faction. Every adventure
they spend helping or harming a faction is one more
hook of engagement with the campaign world and one
less adventure idea you need to come up with.
If your factions are too quiet with a lack of interesting conflict among them, don’t hesitate to create that
conflict. A sector full of turtling factions that hide out
and painstakingly build their resources doesn’t make
for much engagement, so insert a personal grudge or
add a gold-rush opportunity.
When a faction buys an asset, they are not necessarily creating something ex nihilo. They might have
always had that particular resource, but are only now
mobilizing it effectively. A planetary government with
no military assets doesn’t necessarily lack an army, it
just lacks an army that is useful to its current goals.

216• BUYING AND USING ASSETS

BUYING AND USING ASSETS
Assets can be normally purchased on any world that has
a Base of Influence and sufficient tech level to support
their creation. In a few cases, however, acquiring an
asset requires more than just FacCreds and a planet.
Starship-type assets cannot be purchased on a
world with less than several hundred thousand inhabitants unless they can explain how the ships are being
provided or supported by another power. Planets with
very small populations lack such major infrastructure.
Some assets require the permission of a planetary
government in order to purchase them or move them
onto the planet. This is not a formality; the standing
government’s forces can physically disrupt any attempt
to recruit the asset on their world, or shoot it down in
its vulnerable entry phase. Whether or not this permission will be extended will usually depend on the faction’s relationship with a planet’s government, though
bribes of 1d4 FacCreds can occasionally suffice. Under
no conditions will a government willingly permit the
entry of assets powerful enough to overthrow them.
Planetary governments cannot prevent the landing of assets without the permission-needed quality.
Such assets are too unthreatening and nondescript to
alert them until after they’ve already been formed or
have landed. Of course, there is nothing stopping them
from attacking these assets either directly or indirectly
should they feel threatened.
Only one asset can be purchased per turn by a
given faction, and assembling it takes time. The asset
can neither attack, defend, nor give any special benefits
until the beginning of the buyer’s next turn.

Using Faction Assets

As its action for the turn, a faction can choose to use the
special actions of one or more assets. They can trigger
these special abilities in any order, but each form of asset must be used all at the same time; you cannot trigger
Heavy Drop Assets to move a Monopoly asset onto a
world, activate the Monopoly ability to siphon cash,
and then use another Heavy Drop Asset to move the
Monopoly back offworld. All Heavy Drop Assets must
be finished before Monopolies can be triggered, and
so forth. Unless specified otherwise, all asset targets
must be in the same stellar system with the acting assets.
In some cases, assets are called to make a test
against another faction, such as a Cunning vs. Wealth
test. For these tests, the acting asset’s faction rolls 1d10
and adds their score in the acting attribute, while the
target faction rolls 1d10 and adds their score in the defending attribute. If the actor rolls higher than the defender, the action is successful. Certain tags may grant
a faction extra dice for these rolls, in which case the
highest d10 out of those rolled is used. These tests do
not count as attacks, and no damage or counterattacks
are triggered.

Bases of Influence

Bases of Influence are special assets, and use certain
special rules. A faction cannot buy assets on a world
without a Base of Influence, though it can move assets
purchased elsewhere onto the planet, and it can always
buy assets on its homeworld even if its Base of Influence there is destroyed. Of course, that assumes it still
has a Base of Influence somewhere else.
First, a faction can only ever have one Base of Influence on a world at a time. Bases of Influence cannot
be moved once in place. Bases of Influence cannot be
purchased with a Buy Asset action. They can only be
put in place with an Expand Influence action. Bases of
Influence have a sale value of zero FacCreds.
The cost of a Base of Influence is equal to its maximum hit points, which can be up to the owning faction’s maximum hit points. Bases of Influence do not
count against a faction’s maximum assets.
Damage done to a Base of Influence is also done
directly to a faction’s hit points. If a Base of Influence
is brought below zero hit points, the overflow damage
is not counted against the owning faction’s hit points.
As a consequence, a faction must decide how heavily to invest in a particular Base of Influence. A minor
foothold on a world consisting of a base with few hit
points is cheap and risks limited harm to the faction
should it be destroyed, but it’s also more vulnerable to
being wiped out by a rival group.
It’s quite possible for a faction to be effectively
destroyed by smashing enough heavily-invested Bases
of Influence on other worlds. While the homeworld’s
Base might be in perfect condition, the faction has so
badly overextended itself in failed expansion that it
can no longer sustain itself as a going concern. The
resources and personnel that the homeworld needed
to import are no longer available, and the credits and
effort spent on the now-destroyed Bases are wasted.
The backlash from this can be ruinous to any faction.
Every faction also has a homeworld. A homeworld
is always automatically equipped with a Base of Influence with maximum hit points. If a faction moves its
homeworld to a planet that already has a Base of Influence, the base on the new homeworld has its hit points
set to the maximum possible and the homeworld’s Base
of Influence swaps in the hit point value that the destination world’s base originally had.

FACTION GOALS •217

FACTION GOALS
Factions usually have motivations and goals beyond
simple existence. To grow, a faction needs to accomplish goals that are in line with their leadership’s purposes. Successful achievement of these goals helps the
faction grow in strength and influence.
A faction can pursue one goal at a time. Once a goal
is successfully attained, the faction may select a new
one at the beginning of their next turn or delay until a
good opportunity arises. If a faction chooses to abandon a goal, the demoralizing effect of it and the waste
of preparations costs them that turn’s FacCred income,
and they cannot perform any other action that turn.
A faction that successfully accomplishes a goal
gains experience points equal to the goal’s difficulty.
This experience may be saved, or spent at the beginning
of any turn to increase the Force, Cunning, or Wealth
ratings of a faction. Optionally, the GM might allow a
faction to buy a new tag if their deeds justify it.
It’s the GM’s choice as to what might constitute
an appropriate goal for a faction, but below are some
potential goals and the difficulties attached to each.
Military Conquest: Destroy a number of Force assets of
rival factions equal to your faction’s Force rating.
Difficulty is 1/2 number of assets destroyed.
Commercial Expansion: Destroy a number of Wealth
assets of rival factions equal to your faction’s
Wealth rating. Difficulty is 1/2 number of assets
destroyed.
Intelligence Coup: Destroy a number of Cunning assets
of rival factions equal to your faction’s Cunning
rating. Difficulty is 1/2 number of assets destroyed.
Planetary Seizure: Take control of a planet, becoming
the legitimate planetary government. Difficulty
equal to half the average of the current ruling
faction’s Force, Cunning, and Wealth ratings. If
the planet somehow lacks any opposing faction to
resist the seizure, it counts as Difficulty 1.
Expand Influence: Plant a Base of Influence on a new
planet. Difficulty 1, +1 if the attempt is contested
by a rival faction.
Blood the Enemy: Inflict a number of hit points of damage on enemy faction assets or bases equal to your
faction’s total Force, Cunning, and Wealth ratings.
Difficulty 2.
Peaceable Kingdom: Don’t take an Attack action for four
turns. Difficulty 1.
Destroy the Foe: Destroy a rival faction. Difficulty equal
to 1 plus the average of the faction’s Force, Cunning, and Wealth ratings.
Inside Enemy Territory: Have a number of stealthed
assets on worlds with other planetary governments equal to your Cunning score. Units that
are already stealthed on worlds when this goal is
adopted don’t count. Difficulty 2.

Invincible Valor: Destroy a Force asset with a minimum purchase rating higher than your faction’s
Force rating. Thus, if your Force is 3, you need to
destroy a unit that requires Force 4 or higher to
purchase. Difficulty 2.
Wealth of Worlds: Spend FacCreds equal to four times
your faction’s Wealth rating on bribes and influence. This money is effectively lost, but the goal
is then considered accomplished. The faction’s
Wealth rating must increase before this goal can
be selected again. Difficulty 2.

Raising Faction Stats

Faction attributes can be raised at the beginning of
each turn, if enough experience points are available.
The cost of raising a faction attribute rises as the rating
rises. As a faction’s ratings improve, it becomes harder
to destroy, and gains additional maximum hit points.
The maximum hit points of a faction are equal to 4
plus the experience point cost of the highest attributes
in Force, Cunning, and Wealth they have attained.
For example, a faction with Force 3, Cunning 2, and
Wealth 2 has a maximum hit point total of 4 + 4 + 2
+ 2 = 12 hit points. A brand-new faction with Force 1,
Cunning 2, and Wealth 1 has a maximum hit point total
of 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 8 hit points.
Experience points spent by factions differ from
those gained by PCs in that they are lost when they increase an attribute. Once a faction spends 4 XP to raise
Force from 2 to 3, for example, those points are lost,
and 6 more must be spent to raise Force from 3 to 4.

218• CUNNING ASSETS

CUNNING ASSETS
Base of Influence: This asset is special, and is required
for purchasing or upgrading units on a particular
world. Any damage done to a Base of Influence is
also done to a faction’s hit points. The cost of a
Base of Influence equals its maximum hit points,
which can be any number up to the total maximum hit points of its owning faction. A faction’s
bases of influence don’t count against their maximum assets. A Base of Influence can only be purchased with the Expand Influence action.
Blackmail: Selectively degrade the effectiveness of an
asset. Any attempt to attack or defend against
Blackmail loses any bonus dice earned by tags.
Boltholes: Equipped with a number of postech innovations to make cleaning them out a costly and
dangerous pursuit. If a faction Special Forces
or Military Unit asset on the same planet as the
Boltholes suffers damage sufficient to destroy it,
it is instead set at 0 HP and rendered untouchable
and unusable until it is repaired to full strength.
If the Boltholes are destroyed before this happens,
the asset is destroyed with them.
Book of Secrets: Exhaustively cataloged psychometric
records on important and influential local figures,
allowing uncanny accuracy in predicting their actions. Once per turn, a Book of Secrets allows the
faction to reroll one die for an action taken on
that world or force an enemy faction to reroll one
die. This reroll can only be forced once per turn,
no matter how many Books of Secrets are owned.
Covert Shipping: Quiet interstellar asset transport. Any
one Special Forces unit can be moved between any
worlds within three hexes of the Covert Shipping
at the cost of one FacCred.
Covert Transit Net: Facilities web an area of space with
a network of smugglers and gray-market freighter
captains. As an action, any Special Forces assets
can be moved between any worlds within three
hexes of the Covert Transit Net.
Cracked Comms: A cryptographic asset for the interception and deciphering of enemy communications. Friendly fire can be induced with the right
interference. If the Cracked Comms succeeds in
defending against an attack, it can immediately
cause the attacking asset to make an attack against
itself for normal damage or counterattack results.
Cyberninjas: Outfitted with the latest in personal
stealth cyberware, cyberninjas are designed to
avoid all but the most careful scans.
Demagogues: Popular leaders of a particular faith or
ideology that can be relied upon to point their
followers in the direction of maximum utility.
False Front: This asset allows a faction to preserve more
valuable resources. If another asset on the planet
suffers enough damage to destroy it, the faction

can sacrifice the false front instead to nullify the
killing blow.
Informers: Minions that lace a planet’s underworld,
watchful for intruders. They can choose to Attack
a faction without specifying a target asset. On a
successful Cunning vs. Cunning attack, all Stealthed assets on the planet belonging to that faction
are revealed. Informers can target a faction even if
none of their assets are visible on a world; at worst,
they simply learn that there are no stealthed assets.
Lobbyists: Usable to block the governmental permission that is sometimes required to buy an asset or
transport it into a system. When a rival faction
gains permission to do so, the Lobbyists can make
an immediate Cunning vs. Cunning test against
the faction; if successful, the permission is withdrawn and cannot be re-attempted until next turn.
Organization Moles : These can subvert and confuse
enemy assets, striking to damage their cohesion.
Panopticon Matrix: These facilities weave braked-AI
intelligence analysts into a web of observation
capable of detecting the slightest evidence of intruders on a world. Every rival Stealthed asset on
the planet must succeed in a Cunning vs. Cunning
test at the beginning of every turn or lose their
Stealth. The owner also gains an additional die
on all Cunning attacks and defenses on that planet.
Party Machines: Political blocks control particular cities
or regions… blocks that are firmly in control of
the faction. Each turn, a Party Machine provides
1 FacCred to its owning faction.
Popular Movements: A planet-wide surge of enthusiasm
for a cause controlled by the faction. This support pervades all levels of government, and the
government always grants any asset purchase or
movement requests made by the faction.
Saboteurs: Minions rained in launching strikes against
enemy operations. An asset attacked by saboteurs
cannot apply any Use Asset Ability action until the
start of the attacking faction’s next turn. This applies whether or not the attack was successful.
Seditionists: These asset sap a target’s loyalty and will to
obey. For a cost of 1d4 FacCreds, the Seditionists
can attach themselves to an enemy asset. Until
they attach to a different asset or no longer share
the same planet, the affected asset cannot attack.
If the asset is destroyed, the Seditionists survive.
Seductresses: They and their male equivalents subvert
the leadership of enemy assets. As an action, a Seductress can travel to any world within one hex.
As an attack, a Seductress does no damage, but an
asset that has been successfully attacked immediately reveals any other Stealthed assets of that
faction on the planet. Only Special Forces units
can attack a Seductress.

A “P” special code indicates a need for planetary governmental permission to raise or transport in the asset. “A” means
that the asset can perform a special action, and “S” indicates that the asset has a special feature or cost.
Smugglers: Men and women skilled in extracting personnel. For one FacCred, the smugglers asset can
transport itself and/or any one Special Forces unit
to a planet up to two hexes away.
Stealth: Not an asset, per se, but a special quality that
can be purchased for another Special Forces asset
on the planet. An asset that has been Stealthed
cannot be detected or attacked by other factions.
If the unit normally requires the permission of a
planetary government to be moved onto a planet,
that permission may be foregone. An asset loses
its Stealth if it is used to attack or defend.
Transport Lockdown: These techniques involve selective pressure on local routing and shipping companies. On a successful Cunning vs. Cunning attack against a rival faction, the rival faction cannot

transport assets onto that planet without spending
1d4 FacCreds and waiting one turn.
Treachery: Traitors can attack an enemy asset. On a
successful attack, the Treachery asset is lost, 5 FacCreds are gained, and the targeted asset switches
sides to join the traitor’s faction, even if the faction
does not otherwise have the attributes necessary.
Tripwire Cells: These observers are alert to the arrival of stealthed units. Whenever a stealthed asset
lands or is purchased on a planet with tripwire
cells, the Cells make an immediate Cunning vs.
Cunning attack against the owning faction. If successful, the asset loses its stealth.
Vanguard Cadres: Followers of the movement are inspired sufficiently to take up arms and fight on
behalf of their leadership.

220• FORCE ASSETS

FORCE ASSETS
Base of Influence: This asset is special, and is required
for purchasing or upgrading units on a particular
world. Any damage done to a Base of Influence is
also done to a faction’s hit points. The cost of a
Base of Influence equals its maximum hit points,
which can be any number up to the total maximum hit points of its owning faction. A faction’s
bases of influence don’t count against their maximum assets. A Base of Influence can only be purchased with the Expand Influence action.
Beachhead Landers: A collection of short-range,
high-capacity spike drive ships capable of moving
large numbers of troops. As an action, the asset
may move any number of assets on the planet, including itself, to any world within one hex at a cost
of one FacCred per asset moved.
Blockade Fleets: A ragtag lot of corsairs, pirates, privateers, and other deniable assets. When they successfully Attack an enemy faction asset, they steal
1d4 FacCreds from the target faction as well. This
theft can occur to a faction only once per turn,
no matter how many blockade fleets attack. As an
action, this asset may also move itself to a world
within one hex.
Capital Fleets: The pride of an empire, this is a collection of massive capital warships without peer in
most sectors. Capital fleets are expensive to keep
flying, and cost an additional 2 FacCreds of maintenance each turn. As an action, they may move
to any world within three hexes of their current
location. Planetary government permission is required to raise a capital fleet, but not to move one
into a system.
Counterintel Units: These security units specialize in
code breaking, internal security, and monitoring
duties. They can crack open enemy plots long before they have time to come to fruition.
Cunning Traps: This asset covers all the myriad stratagems of war, from induced landslides to spreading
local diseases.
Deep Strike Landers: These advanced transport ships
are capable of moving an asset long distances. As
an action, any one non-Starship asset, including
itself, can be moved between any two worlds
within three hexes of the deep strike landers, at a
cost of 2 FacCreds. This movement can be done
even if the local planetary government objects, albeit doing so is usually an act of open war.
Elite Skirmishers: These lightly-equipped troops are
trained for guerrilla warfare and quick raids.
Extended Theater: These facilities allow for transporting assets long distances. As an action, any one
non-Starship asset, including itself, can be moved
between any two worlds within two hexes of the
extended theater, at a cost of 1 FacCred.

Gravtank Formations: These tank formations are composed of advanced postech gravtank units that are
capable of covering almost any terrain and cracking even the toughest defensive positions.
Guerrilla Populace: Such assets reflect popular support
among the locals and a cadre of men and women
willing to fight as partisans.
Hardened Personnel: These are the employees and support staff of the faction that have been trained in
defensive fighting and equipped with supply caches and hardened fallback positions.
Heavy Drop Assets: These craft allow for the transport
of resources from one world to another. As an
action, any one non-Starship asset, including this
one, may be moved to any world within one hex
for one FacCred.
Hitmen: Crudely-equipped thugs and assassins with
minimal training that have been aimed at a rival
faction’s leadership.
Integral Protocols: A complex web of braked-AI supported sensors and redundant security checks used
to defeat attempts to infiltrate an area. They can
defend only against attacks versus Cunning, but
they add an additional die to the defender’s roll.
Militia Units: Groups of lightly-equipped irregular
troops with rudimentary military training but no
heavy support.
Planetary Defenses: Massive mag cannons and gravitic braker gun arrays designed to defend against
starship bombardments and repel unauthorized
landing. Planetary defenses can only defend
against attacks by Starship-type assets.
Postech Infantry: The backbone of most planetary
armies, these well-trained soldiers are usually
equipped with mag weaponry and combat field
uniforms, and have heavy support units attached.
Pretech Infantry: The cream of the stellar ground
forces, elite troops kitted out in the best pretech
weaponry and armor available, with sophisticated
heavy support weaponry integral to the unit.
Pretech Logistics: These assets represent caches, smugglers, or internal research and salvage programs.
As an action, a pretech logistics asset allows the
owner to buy one Force asset on that world that
requires up to tech level 5 to purchase. This asset
costs half again as many FacCreds as usual, rounded up. Only one asset can be purchased per turn.
Psychic Assassins: Combat-trained psychics equipped
with advanced pretech stealth gear and psitech
weaponry. Psychic assassins automatically start
Stealthed when purchased.
Security Personnel: Standard civilian guards or policemen, usually equipped with nonlethal weaponry
or personal sidearms.

A “P” special code indicates a need for planetary governmental permission to raise or transport in the asset. “A” means
that the asset can perform a special action, and “S” indicates that the asset has a special feature or cost.
Space Marines: Heavily-armored specialist troops
trained for ship boarding actions and opposed
landings. As an action, they can move to any world
within one hex of their current location, whether
or not the planetary government permits it.
Strike Fleets: Forces composed of frigate or cruiser-class
vessels equipped with space-to-ground weaponry
and sophisticated defenses against light planetary
weaponry. As an action, they can move to any
world within one hex of their current location.
Zealots: Members of the faction so utterly dedicated
that they are willing to launch suicide attacks or
hold positions to the death. Zealots take 1d4 damage every time they launch a successful attack or
perform a counterattack.

Eliminating Force Assets
It’s important to remember that a disabled or damaged Force asset hasn’t necessarily been blown to
pieces on a battlefield. When thinking of ways that
a conflict might have harmed such an asset, remember that demoralization, confusion, subversion, and simple lack of upkeep might all cripple
the effectiveness of an asset, or even destroy it as
an effective force without rebuilding as expensive
as buying a fresh asset. A navy with spacemanship
skills so neglected as to constantly run ships into
each other is just as worthless to its owning faction
as a fleet of smoking wrecks, and the only damage
done there was to the organization’s focus.

222• WEALTH ASSETS

WEALTH ASSETS
Bank Assets: Once per turn, the faction can ignore one
cost or FacCred loss imposed by another faction.
This does not require an action. Multiple bank assets allow multiple losses to be ignored.
Base of Influence: These follow the standard rules for
Bases of Influence.
Blockade Runners: These starship captains excel at
transporting goods through unfriendly lines. As
an action, a blockade runner can transfer itself or
any one Military Unit or Special Forces to a world
within three hexes for a cost of two FacCreds.
They can even move units that would otherwise
require planetary government permission to enter.
Commodities Brokers: They substantially lessen the
cost of large-scale investments by timing materials purchases properly. As an action, the owner
of a commodities broker can roll 1d8; that many
FacCreds are subtracted from the cost of their next
asset purchase, down to a minimum of half normal price, rounded down.
Franchise: This asset reflects a deniable connection
with a local licensee for the faction’s goods and
services. When a Franchise successfully attacks a
enemy asset, the enemy faction loses one FacCred
(if available), which is gained by the Franchise’s
owner. This loss can happen only once a turn, no
matter how many Franchises attack.
Freighter Contract: A special link with heavy shipping
spacers. As an action, the faction may move any
one non-Force asset, including this one, to any
world within two hexes at a cost of one FacCred.
Harvesters: These gather the natural resources of a
world, whether ore, biologicals, or other unprocessed goods. As an action, the Harvesters’ owning
faction may roll 1d6. On 3+, gain one FacCred.
Hostile Takeover: This asset can seize control of damaged and poorly-controlled assets. If a Hostile
Takeover does enough damage to destroy an asset, the target is instead reduced to 1 hit point and
acquired by the Hostile Takeover’s owning faction.
Laboratory: The lab allows a world to make hesitant
progress in tech. The presence of a Laboratory
allows assets to be purchased on that world as if it
had Tech Level 4.
Lawyers: Sophists in immaculate suits or charismatic
tribal skalds, lawyers have the ability to tie an enemy up in the coils of their own internal rules, damaging assets with confusion and red tape. Lawyers
cannot attack or counterattack Force assets.
Local Investments: These give the faction substantial influence over the commerce on a world. Any other
faction that tries to buy an asset on that planet
must pay one extra FacCred. This money is not
given to the investments’ owner, but is lost. This
penalty is only applied once.

Marketers: Deployed to confuse enemy factions into
untimely investments. As an action, the marketers
may test Cunning vs. Wealth against a rival faction’s asset. If successful, the target faction must
immediately pay half the asset’s purchase cost,
rounded down, or have it become disabled and
useless until this price is paid.
Medical Center: Salvage and repair damaged assets.
Once between turns, if a Special Forces or Military Unit asset on the world is destroyed, the faction may immediately pay half its purchase cost
to restore it with one hit point. Any Repair Asset
action taken on that world costs one less FacCred
for Special Forces and Military Units.
Mercenaries: Groups of well-equipped, highly-trained
soldiers willing to serve the highest bidder. Mercenaries have a maintenance cost of one FacCred
per turn. As an action, Mercenaries can move to
any world within one hex of their current location.
To purchase or move a Mercenary asset to a planet
requires government permission.
Monopoly: An open or tacit stranglehold on certain vital
businesses or resources on a world. As an action,
owners of a monopoly may force one other faction
with unstealthed assets on that world to pay them
one FacCred. If the target faction can’t pay, they
lose one asset of their choice on the world.
Postech Industry: As an action, the owning faction can
roll 1d6 for a Postech Industry asset. On a 1, one
FacCred is lost, on a 2-4 one FacCred is earned,
and a 5-6 returns two FacCreds. If money is lost
and no resources are available to pay it, the Postech Industry is destroyed.
Pretech Manufactories: Rare, precious examples of
functioning pretech industrial facilities, retrofitted to work without the benefit of specialized psychic disciplines. As an action, the owning faction
can roll 1d8 for a Pretech Manufactory, and gain
half that many FacCreds, rounded up.
Pretech Researchers: A highly versatile team of research
and design specialists capable of supporting limited pretech… as long as they’re adequately funded. Any world with Pretech Researchers on it is
treated as tech level 5 for the purpose of buying
Cunning and Wealth assets. Pretech researchers
have a maintenance cost of 1 FacCred per turn.
R&D Departments: These allow the smooth extension
of wealth-creation and industrial principles to the
farthest reaches of the faction’s operations. A faction with an R&D department may treat all planets as having tech level 4 for purposes of buying
Wealth assets.
Scavenger Fleets: These rag-tag armadas bring enormous technical and mercantile resources to their
patrons, along with a facility with heavy guns. As

an action, a Scavenger Fleet can be moved to any
world within three hexes. Scavenger Fleets cost 2
FacCreds a turn in maintenance.
Shipping Combine: Transport large amounts of equipment and personnel between worlds. As an action,
the combine may move any number of non-Force
assets, including itself, to any world within two
hexes at a cost of one FacCred per asset.
Surveyors: Explore potential resource and investment
options on worlds. The presence of a Surveyor
crew allows one additional die to be rolled on
Expand Influence actions. As an action, a surveyor
crew can be moved to any world within two hexes.
Transit Web: These facilities allow almost effortless relocation of all assets. For one FacCred, any number of non-starship Cunning or Wealth assets may

be moved between any two worlds within three
hexes of the Transit Web. This may be done freely
on the owner’s turn so long as the fee can be paid,
and using the ability doesn’t require an action.
Union Toughs: These bruisers don’t much like scabs and
management, and they’re willing to take the faction’s word on which people are which. They’re
lightly armed and poorly trained, but they can infiltrate to perform sabotage.
Venture Capital: This asset grows resources out of
seemingly nowhere, harvesting the best of entrepreneurship for the faction’s benefit. As an action,
venture capital can be tapped. 1d8 is rolled; on a 1,
the asset is destroyed, while on a 2-3 one FacCred
is gained, 4-7 yields two FacCreds and 8 grants
three FacCreds.

224• FACTION TAGS

FACTION TAGS
Most factions have some unique quality about them,
some trait that distinguishes them from other factions
of similar resources. Whether a particularly fanatical
band of ideological crusaders or an ancient order of
pacifistic scientists, faction tags allow a GM to give a
group a few special tricks of their own.
A faction should generally be given one tag, or two
at the most for particularly versatile organizations. The
exception is the Planetary Government tag, which can
be acquired– and lost– multiple times to reflect the
faction’s seizure of new worlds. Factions tags do not
normally change without some drastic and organization-shaping event.
Colonists
This faction is a fresh colony on an otherwise largely
untouched planet. It is this brave band of pioneers that
will tame the world’s wild forces and bring forth a better life for those who come after.
Effect: This faction has all the benefits of the Planetary
Government tag for its homeworld, as no other
government exists on a fresh colony. The faction’s
homeworld is also treated as if it had at least tech
level 4. Colonies with fewer than 100,000 citizens lack the necessary industrial infrastructure
to build Spaceship-type assets.
Deep Rooted
This faction has been part of a world’s life for time out
of mind. Most natives can hardly imagine the world
without this faction’s presence, and the traditional prerogatives and dignities of the group are instinctively
respected.
Effect: This faction can roll one additional d10 when
defending against attacks on assets on their homeworld. If the faction ever changes homeworlds,
this tag is lost.
Eugenics Cult
The forbidden maltech secrets of advanced human genetic manipulation are known to this faction, and they
use them with gusto. Slave-engineered humanoids and
“deathless” leadership are just two of the more common
alterations these unstable scientists undertake.
Effect: Eugenics Cultists can buy the Gengineered
Slaves asset; it’s an asset requiring Force 1 with
the statistics of 6 HP, 2 FacCred cost, tech level 4
required, with an Attack of Force vs. Force/1d6
damage and a Counterattack of 1d4 damage. Once
per turn, the Eugenics Cult can roll an extra d10
on an attack or defense by a Gengineered Slaves
asset, regardless of the stat being used. Gengineered Slaves can count as either a Military Unit
or Special Forces, determined when the cult first
creates a specific asset.

Exchange Consulate
This faction is either led through an Exchange Consulate or has close ties with that pacifistic society of
bankers and diplomats. The sophisticated economic
services they provide strengthen the faction.
Effect: When the faction successfully completes a
“Peaceable Kingdom” Goal, they may roll 1d6; on
a 4+, they gain a bonus experience point. Once
per turn, the faction may roll an extra d10 when
defending against a Wealth attack.
Fanatical
The members of this faction just don’t know when to
quit. No matter how overmatched, the members will
keep fighting to the bitter end- and occasionally past it.
Effect: The faction always rerolls any dice that come up
as 1. This zealousness leaves them open at times,
however; they always lose ties during attacks.
Imperialists
This faction nurses wild dreams of controlling the sector, whether out of an impulse to bring their local culture and technology to less fortunate worlds or simple
lust for dominion. They excel at defeating planetary
defenses and standing armies.
Effect: This faction may roll an extra d10 for attacks
made as part of a Seize Planet action.
Machiavellian
This faction’s meat and drink is intrigue, its members
delighting in every opportunity to scheme. It may be
a secret cabal of hidden masters or the decadent court
of a fallen stellar empire, but its membership has forgotten more of treachery than most others ever learn.
Effect: Once per turn, this faction can roll an additional
d10 when making a Cunning attack.
Mercenary Group
The faction sells its services to the highest bidder, and
is an extremely mobile organization. Vast amounts of
men and material can be moved interstellar distances
in just a few months.
Effect: All faction assets gain the following special ability: As an action, the asset may move itself to any
world within one hex.
Perimeter Agency
This faction is or is closely tied to an Agency of the
enigmatic Perimeter organization. Originally organized by the Terran Mandate to detect and contain
maltech outbreaks until Mandate fleet resources could
be dispatched, the Perimeter retains numerous ancient
override codes for pretech security protocols.
Effect: Once per turn, the faction may roll an additional d10 when making an attack against an asset

FACTION TAGS •225
that requires tech level 5 to purchase. The faction
may roll an extra die when making a test to detect
Stealthed assets.
Pirates
This faction is a scourge of the spacelanes, driving up
the cost of shipping and terrorizing merchant captains
without pity. They steal and refit ships with vicious
ingenuity, cobbling together space armadas out of the
leavings of their prey.
Effect: Any movement of an asset onto a world that has
a Base of Influence for this faction costs one extra
FacCred, paid to this faction.
Planetary Government
This faction is the legitimate government of a planet.
Rebel groups and rival factions may have assets on the
planet, but control over the instruments of the state
is firmly in this faction’s hands. The faction may rule
openly, or it may simply have an inexorable grasp on
the existing authorities.
Effect: The faction’s permission is required to buy or
import those assets marked as needing government permission. This tag can be acquired multiple times, once for each planet the faction controls.
Plutocratic
This faction prizes wealth, and its membership strives
constantly to expand and maintain personal fortunes.
Perhaps it is a ruling council of oligarchs or a star-spanning trade cartel.
Effect: Once per turn, this faction can roll an additional
d10 when making a Wealth attack.
Preceptor Archive
This faction is or has close ties to a Preceptor Archive
a place of learning operated by the learned Preceptors
of the Great Archive. These Archives are peaceful institutions dedicated to the spread of practical knowledge and useful engineering to the wider cosmos. Their
large numbers of educated personnel make advanced
equipment more practical for deployment.
Effect: Purchasing an asset that requires tech level 4 or
more costs one fewer FacCred than normal. The
Preceptor Archive may also take the special action
“Teach Planetary Population”, costing 2 FacCreds
and allowing them to roll 1d12 for one world. On
a 12, the world’s tech level permanently becomes
4 for the purposes and purchases of this faction.
Psychic Academy
Most significant factions are capable of employing psychics, but this faction can actually train their own. They
excel at precise and focused application of the psionic
disciplines, and can get far more out of their available
psychic resources than other factions.
Effect: This faction can provide psionic mentor training to qualified psychics. Once per turn, this fac-

tion can also force a rival faction to reroll any one
d10, whether or not they’re involved in the roll.
Savage
Whether a proud tribe of neoprimitives struggling
against the material limits of their world or a pack of
degenerate tomb world cannibals, this faction is accustomed to surviving without the benefits of advanced
technology and maximizing local resources.
Effect: Once per turn, this faction can roll an extra die
when defending with an asset that requires tech
level 0 to purchase.
Scavengers
This faction might live within the wreckage of a tomb
world, salvage the castoffs of some decadent pleasure-world or ply the ruins of an orbital scrapyard.
Whatever their territory, this faction knows how to
find worth amid seemingly useless trash.
Effect: Whenever the faction destroys an asset or has
one of their assets destroyed, they gain 1 FacCred.
Secretive
This faction is marked by elaborate protocols of secrecy and misdirection. It may be split up into numerous
semi-autonomous cells, or consist largely of trained espionage professionals. Finding the assets of such a faction can often be more difficult than destroying them.
Effect: All assets purchased by this faction automatically begin Stealthed. See the list of Cunning assets
for details on Stealth.
Technical Expertise
The faction is staffed by large numbers of expert engineers and scientists. They can turn even the most
unpromising labor pool into superb technicians.
Effect: This faction treats all planets on which they
have a Base of Influence as if they were at least
tech level 4. They can build Starship-type assets
on any world with at least ten thousand occupants.
Theocratic
The faction is fueled by the fierce certainty that God
is with them- and with no one else. The tight and
occasionally irrational obedience that pervades the
organization makes it difficult to infiltrate or subvert
effectively.
Effect: Once per turn, this faction can roll an extra d10
when defending against a Cunning attack.
Warlike
There are factions with a military orientation, and then
there are factions that just really love killing things.
Whether or not this faction has developed sophisticated military resources and techniques, the membership
is zealous in battle and has a positive taste for fighting.
Effect: Once per turn, this faction can roll an additional
d10 when making a Force attack.

226• FACTIONS IN YOUR CAMPAIGN

FACTIONS IN YOUR CAMPAIGN
To create a faction, first decide on the scale of the organization. Many factions are restricted to a single world,
and even the most impressive sector empire rarely
exerts direct control over more than a dozen worlds.
Place the faction’s homeworld and locate any Bases of
Influence it might have on other worlds. A few words
beside each Base describing the form it takes can be
handy in later planning out adventures with the faction.
Next, prioritize the faction’s attributes, deciding
the order in which they focus on Force, Cunning, and
Wealth. Minor factions should have a 4 in their most
important attribute, established planetary governments should have a 6, and regional hegemons should
have an 8. Their second-most important attribute is
one less than their primary, and their tertiary attribute
is three less. You can calculate the faction’s hit points
from that, but normally minor powers will have 15 HP,
major powers will have 29 HP, and sector hegemons
will have 49 HP. Their off-world Bases of Influence
normally have a maximum HP equal to half that.
Give minor powers one asset in their primary attribute and one asset in a different attribute. Give major
powers two assets in their primary attribute, and two
assets in different attributes, and give regional hegemons four assets in their primary and four in others.
Place these assets on the worlds occupied by the faction.
Select an appropriate faction tag for the organization, one fitting their special focus and origins. If the
faction has direct governmental control over one or
more worlds, add Planetary Government tags to them.
Finally, select a Goal for the faction. For your initial three or four sector factions, try to pick goals that
will put them in conflict with each other. If the factions
you make are content to hide from the world and get
along in peace and quiet, they’re unlikely to be terribly
useful as patrons or enemies for the PC group, unless
you intend to enlist the PCs as defenders of some beleaguered group of innocents.

Creating PC Factions

Eventually, it’s likely that a PC is going to accumulate
the necessary power and influence to start their own
faction. Often around 9th level, a PC has gained enough
renown and competence that others will want to serve
them, and they can choose to parlay that into a faction
of their own. This may happen at earlier levels, depending on whether or not the PC has made it a significant
priority to develop their own faction.
Newly-founded factions are fragile, vulnerable
things. They start with a score of 2 in their primary
attribute and 1 in the others, 8 hit points, and one asset
in their primary attribute. The GM may select one faction tag appropriate to the new organization’s nature.
The exact details of a PC’s new faction will depend largely on what the character did to form it. A PC

who organizes a colonial expedition to an uninhabited
world will end up with a faction very different from
that of a PC that starts her own psychic academy. In
general, PCs have to actively work to create their faction. It does not simply arrive as their natural birthright.

Adventures and Factions

The actions of adventurers fall outside the faction turn,
but the consequences of their escapades can translate
into the loss or acquisition of FacCreds, assets, or faction hit points. If the players come up with a scheme to
strike at the leadership of the Brotherhood of the New
Man, success or failure isn’t determined according to
Force attacks or Cunning defenses. Success is determined by the outcome of the adventure itself, and the
group’s ability to overcome the security and obfuscation that surrounds these mad gengineers.
The amount of damage done or benefit given to a
faction by a group’s adventures should be substantial, at
least as much as could be accomplished with a faction
turn. It may not be possible to bring down an interstellar empire by precision strikes and subversion, but the
players should be able to see concrete effects from their
successes. At the very least, the newslines at the end of
each faction turn should include public commentary on
the visible consequences of their actions.
Some players will want to take advantage of the
resources of their factions in the course of their adventures, either bringing along troops or specialists, or
utilizing faction assets on a personal level. This should
be permitted as a general matter; there’s not much fun
in being a colonial governor if you can’t even get a
corporal’s guard of bodyguards to look after you. Faction equipment should also be available in reasonable
amounts. Subordinates are not adventurers, however,
and while they will perform their duties diligently and
well, they won’t willingly take the kind of risks that
adventurers often relish. Faction assets should be an
advantage and a tool for the PCs rather than a crutch.
It may come up that a character wants to withdraw credits from his faction, or donate loot won in the
course of their adventuring. FacCreds translate poorly
into normal credits, as they often represent resources
that don’t liquidate easily into cash. The GM should feel
free to prohibit directly withdrawing cash from a faction if a PC comes to rely on it too heavily. Otherwise,
one FacCred will usually translate into about 100,000
credits worth of cash, with substantially larger returns
if used to make investments, or build things.
Characters can give up to 1d4 x 100,000 credits
to a faction in any one turn, with each 100,000 credits
becoming 1 FacCred. Any more than this in one turn is
wasted due to accounting inefficiency, and the faction
will need to spend a full turn processing the donation
before it becomes FacCreds.

EXAMPLE FACTIONS •227

EXAMPLE FACTIONS
A GM doesn’t always have time to sort out the details
of every faction that might be needed. A group might
decide to attack the planetary government of a world
that wasn’t important or interesting enough to merit
the effort to define its governmental faction during
sector creation, for example. The following sample
factions can be pulled and used for such places as necessary. Where appropriate, you can add the Planetary
Government tag for legitimate world governments.
Colony World
Thinly-populated worlds with limited infrastructure
tend to have weak colonial governments concerned
chiefly with issues of basic survival rather than expansion or intrigue.
Attributes: Force 4, Cunning 3, Wealth 1
Hit Points: 15
Assets: Guerrilla Populace/Force 2 and Saboteurs/Cunning 2
Tags: Colonists
Lost World
Primitive and barbaric by the standards of the space going worlds, a lost world lacks the technical resources of
their neighbors, but may well have substantial advantages in population and cultural cohesion depending on
the world’s habitability.
Attributes: Force 4, Cunning 1, Wealth 3
Hit Points: 15
Assets: Zealots/Force 3, Harvesters/Wealth 1
Tags: Savage
Backwater Planet
Perhaps this world was important once, but disaster,
ennui, or the Scream has left it a sleepy planet disinterested in the wider galaxy. Most worlds with ordinary
levels of technology in a sector will fit this template.
Attributes: Force 6, Cunning 3, Wealth 5
Hit Points: 29
Assets: Postech Infantry/Force 4, Planetary Defenses/
Force 6, Informers/Cunning 1, Bank/Wealth 4
Tags: Deep Rooted
Zealous Faith
This religious organization is a powerful force in the
sector, likely with major congregations on several
worlds.
Attributes: Force 3, Cunning 6, Wealth 5
Hit Points: 29
Assets: Demagogue/Cunning 6, Organization Moles/
Cunning 5, Zealots/Force 3, Marketers/Wealth 5
Tags: Theocratic

Regional Hegemon
This world is the mightiest military power in the sector
and leads a half-dozen neighboring worlds in a “voluntary confederation” that it ever seeks to expand.
Attributes: Force 8, Cunning 5, Wealth 7
Hit Points: 49
Assets: Space Marines/Force 7, Planetary Defenses/
Force 6, Blockade Fleet/Force 5, Extended Theater/Force 4, Pretech Manufactory/Wealth 7,
Shipping Combine/Wealth 4, Tripwire Cells/
Cunning 4, Cyberninjas/Cunning 3
Tags: Imperialists
Mercantile Combine
A star-spanning consortium of merchants might operate out of one particular world, but their final loyalty
is always to their credit balance.
Attributes: Force 3, Cunning 5, Wealth 6
Hit Points: 29
Assets: Venture Capital/Wealth 6, Shipping Combine/
Wealth 4, Hardened Personnel/Forces 2, Blackmail/Cunning 2
Tags: Plutocratic
Eugenics Cult
Some people are born to rule- literally. These eugenics
cults believe that superior breeds of humanity can be
successfully engineered, and that good genetic background legitimizes rule over less “advanced” humans.
Such cults are widely loathed, but the experimental
medical treatment they offer to those who can find
them makes unwilling converts of some.
Attributes: Force 3, Cunning 6, Wealth 5
Hit Points: 29
Assets: Boltholes/Cunning 5, Demagogue/Cunning 6,
Laboratory/Wealth 3, Gengineered Slaves/Force
1
Tags: Eugenics Cult
Rebel Freedom Fighters
Even in the most tyrannical corners of the galaxy, the
human heart yearns for freedom. These factions spring
up in the shadow of oppressive governments. For each
one that is crushed, a new one rises in time.
Attributes: Force 3, Cunning 4, Wealth 1
Hit Points: 15
Assets: Seditionists/Cunning 4, Zealots/Force 3
Tags: Secretive

228• EXAMPLE OF FACTION PLAY

AN EXAMPLE OF FACTION PLAY
The GM has just finished brewing up her initial sector.
She has a rough sketch of the worlds, she’s fleshed out
the planet where the initial play session will occur, and
she’s ready to run the game. She thinks it’d be nice to
have some background activity going on, so she plans
to create three factions to decorate her world.
She picks out three groups that are likely to be
significant players in this corner of her sector: the harsh
planetary government of Typhon, the initial starting
point for the game, the Rathskeller Combine, a multistellar megacorp based off the world of Danube in
the neighboring solar system, and the Way of Voth, a
pretech-worshiping cult with a hidden base on Singularity, a gas giant moon in a system neighboring both.
These aren’t the only possible factions in the system, of course, but they’re the ones most likely to be
pertinent to PC interests. If the PCs move on, she might
retire some of these factions to bring in new ones. She
knows she shouldn’t have more than a half-dozen factions active at once unless she’s ready to do a lot of
tracking during each faction turn.
She knows the Typhon government is a fairly
powerful faction, having effective control of its home
planet save for some plucky rebels against its autocratic
monarchy. Force is its strongest tool, so she gives it a
rating of 6 in that, followed by Wealth of 5 and Cunning of 3. Its maximum hit points are 29. As a major
power, it has two Force assets and two more assets of
any kind. Typhon would love to have Pretech Infantry
and has the Force score to support it, but its tech level
is 4, too low for such advanced troops. It settles for a
Strike Fleet and some Postech Infantry. Aside from that,
it has a government Monopoly on spike drive components and a Postech Industry that helps make them.
It also has a Base of Influence on its home world of
Typhon that automatically has 29 hit points, the same
as the faction itself. Finally, it has the faction tag of
Planetary Government, because it’s the legitimate ruler
of Typhon.
For the Rathskeller Combine, the GM decides that
it’s about as powerful as the Typhon government due
to its far-flung mercantile connections. On reflection,
she thinks its main money comes from its control of
the ship-building industry outside the Typhon system,
which makes it an economic competitor with the staterun Typhon shipyards. She gives it a Wealth rating of
6, Force of 5, and Cunning of 3, with a maximum HP
of 29. Since it’s starship-centric, she gives it Shipping
Combine and Blockade Runner assets for Wealth, and
other assets of Elite Skirmishers and Saboteurs. The
Plutocratic tag fits its mercantile origins.
For the final faction, the GM decides to make
them a relatively weak group, one that tries to use its
limited supplies of pretech artifacts to manipulate “less
developed” societies. She gives it a Cunning score of

4, a Wealth of 3, and a Force of 1. Its maximum hit
points are 15. It gets only two assets as a minor power,
so goes with Cyberninjas and Covert Shipping to get
those ninjas where they need to go. The GM mulls over
the faction tags, but none seem to be quite right. She
decides to give it her own tag of “Pretech Stores”, letting it treat Singularity as a tech level 5 world for purposes of buying high-tech assets there. While there’s no
other meaningful authority on the gas giant moon, the
GM doesn’t think it’s proper to give them the Planetary
Government tag because there really isn’t anything else
on Singularity except the Vothite base. They don’t have
the implicit military power to prevent hostile military
assets from landing on the world, so they don’t really
fit the mold of the Planetary Government tag.
The last step in creating the factions is to give each
of them an initial goal. She decides that the Rathskeller
Combine is really interested in breaking into Typhon’s
closed market. She gives it the Expand Influence goal,
which rewards it when it can found a Base of Influence
on another planet. Typhon is a violent, expansionistic
power that goes in for Blood the Enemy, so it seeks to
inflict hit point damage on rival assets equal to the sum
of its attributes, or 14 points. The Vothites know they
can’t survive a direct confrontation with either important power, so they want to get ready to make a move
when they’re stronger; they choose Peaceable Kingdom,
needing to spend four consecutive turns without taking
an Attack action.
With this established, the GM is ready to run the
first faction turn.

Turn One

The GM randomly selects the Rathskeller Combine to
go first, followed by Typhon, and then the Vothites.
First, the Combine earns its income for the turn;
half its Wealth plus a quarter of its total Force and Cunning, rounded down. That means 5 FacCreds.
Next, it pays maintenance. It has no assets that
require maintenance and hasn’t got more assets of any
one type than its corresponding attribute, so it has no
maintenance cost. If it were to accumulate four Cunning assets, however, while only having a Cunning of
3, it would have to pay one FacCred for each over the
limit. Bases of Influence don’t count for this purpose.
Now the Combine has to decide what action to
take. It knows that Typhon is itching for a fight. The
Combine is nervous about their rival’s Strike Fleet,
but that seems to be the only force that immediately
threatens them. The Postech Infantry that Typhon has
doesn’t have any practical way to cross into Danubian
space unless Typhon buys some sort of transport asset.
Right now there seems no way for the Typhonians
to do that, so the Combine decides to go for a long
economic game, taking the Buy Asset action to spend 2

EXAMPLE OF FACTION PLAY •229
FacCreds on Harvesters. The GM decides that this represents a new flotilla of asteroid mining tugs. A faction
can buy only one asset per turn and can take only one
action, so the Combine’s turn is over.
Typhon isn’t wasting any time. It gets its FacCred
income for the turn of 4 FacCreds and uses its action to
Use Asset Ability to let its Strike Fleet enter the Danube
system. Some assets require governmental permission
to move them into a system with an existing government, but not Strike Fleets. They tend to make their
own permission. Typhon would like to start attacking
Combine assets, but it can only take one action per turn,
so it will have to wait until the next one to open fire.
The Vothites are keeping their head down, accruing their 2 FacCreds. As poor as they are, they need
to do something about it, so they invest in a Buy Asset action to get a Harvester. The GM decides that it
represents scavenger teams dispatched to loot vital
resources from the dangerous pretech caches hidden
on Singularity.
As the final step, the GM translates these faction
actions into newsfeed stories to share with the PCs.
She scribbles up short news blasts about “Typhon First
Fleet Dispatched to Suppress Piracy in the Danube System”, “Rathskeller Combine Commissions New Wing
of Asteroid Miners”, and “Unusual Ship Traffic In Singularity System”. These stories may not have the whole
truth about affairs, but they’re what the PCs would find
out from the local news organizations.

Turn Two

The PCs completed their first adventure and are busy
swanning around in the Danube system. Nothing
they’ve done directly impinges on the local factions,
so the GM simply runs the next faction turn after the
session is over. Random rolls give Voth the first action,
then Typhon, and then the Combine.
Voth gets another 2 FacCreds and dutifully uses
Buy Asset to get another Harvester, scaling up their salvage efforts. This makes two Wealth assets that Voth
has; it can get one more Wealth asset before it starts to
have to pay maintenance on any additional ones. They
would’ve liked to have used Use An Asset to see if their
existing Harvester made them any money, but they
can’t take two different actions during the same turn,
so they must wait for now.
Typhon now collects its 4 FacCreds, for a total of
8, and uses the Attack action. If it had multiple assets in
position, it could attack with all of them; as it stands,
only the Strike Fleet is in the same location as a rival
power. It aims at the Base of Influence, but the Combine gets to decide which asset the Strike Fleet engages.
It chooses to defend with its Blockade Runners. The
Strike Fleet’s Attack is Force versus Force, so Typhon
rolls 1d10 and adds its Force rating for a score of 11.
Against this, the Combine rolls 1d10 and adds its own
Force rating for a score of 12. The Strike Fleet’s attack
has failed, and it takes the Counterattack damage of the

Blockade Runners, for 2d4 damage, for 7 points. The
Strike Fleet is now down to 1 hit point.
The Rathskeller Combine now senses an opportunity. They collect their income of 5 FacCreds for a total
of 8 and take an Attack action of their own, ordering
the Saboteurs to press the attack. The Strike Fleet is the
only viable target in the sector, so Typhon is forced to
defend with it. The Saboteurs’ attack is Cunning versus
Cunning. The Combine rolls an 8, a tepid result, while
the Strike Fleet gets lucky and rolls a 9. The Saboteurs
are forced to take the Strike Fleet’s counterattack damage of 1d8, and roll a 6; they are wiped out. Stung, the
Combine throws the Elite Skirmishers into the fray,
the only other asset they have that even has an attack.
They roll a Force vs. Force attack, Typhon rolls badly,
and the Strike Fleet is destroyed.
The GM then writes up the news blasts for the
session, describing how “pirate” boarding parties destroyed the Typhonian strike fleet by taking advantage
of security breaches caused by recently-discovered saboteurs. She decides that both Danube and Typhon want
to avoid outright war, and that Danube’s planetary government won’t get involved so long as Typhon is only
cutting down Combine holdings.

Turn Three

As it turns out, the PCs took notice of that news item
about Singularity’s ship activity and decided to investigate. In the course of their adventure they killed a
Vothite salvage crew and snatched away a precious haul
of pretech artifacts that the crew had been recovering.
The GM decides that this costs the Vothites one of their
two Harvester assets. There is no die roll or faction action related to this; the PCs did it, so it simply happens.
They also left plenty of evidence, so the GM makes a
note to have a Vothite cyberninja come after them and
their stolen artifacts. Such small-scale actions related to
PC adventures don’t require a full faction action, so the
Vothites don’t need to use an Attack action to go after
the troublesome PCs.
The Vothites go first this round and are not
amused. They collect their 2 FacCreds and Use An
Ability to see if their remaining Harvester makes them
any money; they roll a 4 on its ability and gain an extra
FacCred, for a total of 3 in its coffers this turn.
Typhon goes next, collecting 4 FacCreds for a total
of 12. It’s licking its wounds, but at least it managed to
inflict 6 of the necessary 14 points of damage on a foe
to succeed at its Blood the Enemy goal. It uses Buy Asset
to buy a new Strike Fleet, reconstituting it from the
survivors and spending all 12 FacCreds on it.
The Combine goes last, and is at a crossroads. Their
income this turn gives them 13 FacCreds and they’ve
successfully destroyed a Typhionian Strike Fleet, but
it cost them their Saboteurs, and they have only one
asset left that can even attack at all. What should they
do to address the Typhonian menace? Maybe some PC
mercenaries might tip the scales for them…
