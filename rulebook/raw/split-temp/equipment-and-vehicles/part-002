fix its location within one meter, the distortion cannon
can ignore up to one meter of solid cover between the
gun and its target.

68• MELEE WEAPONS

MELEE WEAPONS
Despite the relentless march of science, melee weapons
are still useful adjuncts on the field of battle. They are
silent, cheap, often easily concealed, and much more reliably murderous than firearms or laser weaponry. It’s
easy to miss a moving target in the adrenaline-fueled
chaos of a firefight. It’s much harder to go astray with
a monoblade knife in your fist.

Types of Common Weapons

Rather than enumerate every possible type of sharp
object and blunt implement that has been used for
death-dealing amid the scattered stars, melee weapons
are divided into three classes.
Small weapons are small one-handed implements
no larger than a baton or knife. These weapons are
easily concealed in normal clothing, and can even be
kept Readied up sleeves or in tailored pockets. Many
can be thrown at a range up to 10 meters.
Medium weapons are one-handed swords, axes,
spears, or other obvious implements of war. While
they can’t be effectively concealed in anything smaller than an enveloping cloak or coat, they’re also more
damaging to an unfortunate victim struck by them, albeit they’re somewhat less nimble when the wielder
needs to strike at unprotected flesh. Spears and similar
aerodynamic weapons can be thrown up to 30 meters.
Large weapons are two-handed implements of
bodily ruin such as claymores, halberds, tetsubos, or
other such weapons. Unlike smaller weapons, they
rely largely on Strength for their employ, and can bash
through lighter forms of armor. Large weapons count
as two encumbrance items.
Aside from their type, weapons are counted as
primitive or advanced. A primitive weapon is simply
one of ordinary metal or wood, with no high-tech
augmentations. An advanced one has been given a
monoblade edge, kinetic sheathing, thermal wires, a
chainsaw blade, or some other TL4 touch. Primitive
weapons are often unable to harm targets in powered
armor, while advanced weapons can ignore primitive
plate and hide protections.

Other Melee Weapons

Stun batons are common law enforcement tools. The
damage they do can drop a target to zero hit points, but
will not kill them, the victim awakening in ten minutes
with one hit point. Stun batons trickle-charge from
normal movement and will not run out of electrical
energy under normal use conditions.
Suit rippers are rods with fractal cutting surfaces
designed to cripple vacc suit auto-repair routines. Every hit with a suit ripper counts as a suit tear on a vacc
suit-wearing enemy. Unsurprisingly, these weapons
are strictly illegal in space environments.
Unarmed attacks reflect ordinary kicks and punches. Unarmed attacks always add the attacker’s Punch
skill to damage rolls, unlike other weapons. Kinesis
wraps, spiked knuckles, and other small fist weapons
may be treated as small advanced or primitive weapons
that use the Punch skill and add the skill level to their
rolled damage, but not to Shock. Such weapons do not
augment a hero with the Unarmed Combatant focus.

Shock

Many melee weapons have a Shock trait representing the danger they pose to an ill-armored opponent.
Shock damage represents the inevitable cuts, bruises,
exhaustion, and terror of close combat.
Shock damage is only inflicted on a melee target if
the hit roll fails, and it only applies if the target has an
AC equal or less than that listed for the Shock.
Shock damage always includes the wielder’s attribute modifier and any bonus damage granted by weapon mods, foci, advanced tech, or other damage bonuses.
An actual hit with a weapon never does less damage
than Shock would otherwise inflict; if the user somehow rolls less damage, use the Shock damage instead.
Thus, if you had a Strength score of 14 and were
swinging an oversized alien battle axe at a target with
AC 13, you would inflict 3 points of damage on a miss;
2 from the weapon’s Shock, plus 1 from your Strength
modifier. If you hit, you’d do at least 3 points.

HEAVY WEAPONS •69

HEAVY WEAPONS
Some weapons are simply too big to be comfortably
used without a tripod, fixed support, or vehicle mounting. Others require specialized training in the use of
heavy munitions. The weapons listed here all use the
Shoot skill to determine hit bonuses, and unless otherwise noted, all require some sort of support for firing.
Energy weapons use Type B power cells. Rocket
launchers and hydra arrays use missiles as given on the
gear tables, while heavy machine guns and wheatcutter
belts consume large amounts of standard ammunition.
Some heavy guns can be fired to suppress. Double
the usual ammunition is fired in one round, and every
target in front of the weapon that is not under hard
cover is automatically hit for half normal damage. A
successful Evasion saving throw eliminates this damage.
When firing at TL4 military vehicles such as
gravtanks, mechs, or starship armor, most TL3 Heavy
weapons don’t count as Heavy for armor-penetrating
purposes. Demo charges and explosives do, however.

Heavy Weapons

Heavy machine guns represent a large family of air- or
water-cooled projectile weapons that are usually fed
with belts of linked ammunition. HMGs require a vehicle mounting or emplaced firing position for effective
results. An HMG magazine contains enough ammunition for 10 rounds of firing, but each round of firing
eats 25 credits worth of projectile ammunition.
Rocket launchers cover a wide variety of man-portable missile launchers of varying degrees of sophistication. The weapons are usually equipped with basic
tracking sensors, but are of limited accuracy against human-sized targets. Rocket launchers take a -4 hit penalty against targets of human size or smaller. Unlike most
Heavy weapons, rocket launchers can be shoulder-fired
without a prepared emplacement to support them.
Demo Charges are the general run of placed explosives beloved of terrorists and adventurers the world
over. The usual variety can be detonated by radio
signals, timers, or electrical charges, and inflict their
damage on any objects within twenty meters, with an

Demo Charge

Anti-Vehicle Laser

Vortex Cannon

Evasion saving throw for half damage. Victims within
forty meters take half damage, with an Evasion save
for none. The charge is sufficient to blow a four-meter
wide hole in anything short of a reinforced wall. PCs
with a background in demolitions or Fix-0 skill can
shape the charge so it directs the blast in only one direction, sparing all but two meters of the rest.
Railguns are simply scaled-up versions of personal
mag rifles. They accelerate large metallic slugs along
the weapon’s barrel, creating a steady spray of hypervelocity rounds. Ammunition sufficient for one round
of firing costs 50 credits.
Anti-vehicle lasers are less useful against soft targets,
but excel at penetrating vehicle armor. Against vehicles
and other hard-skinned targets, damage is rolled twice
and the better result is used.
Hydra arrays sequence a number of missile
launchers to fire at once. The gunner designates up to
three targets and can then make three rolls to hit divided among them. Each successful hit on a target allows
the gunner to roll damage once, but only the highest
damage roll is applied to the target. Thus, if all three
volleys were aimed at a single target and two of them
hit, the gunner would roll damage twice and apply the
best result. A volley from the array costs 150 credits.
Wheatcutter belts are one of several different antipersonnel measures often installed on gravtanks and
other fighting vehicles. When triggered, a belt of explosives fires off a scything blast of shrapnel on any side
of the vehicle. All creatures within 10 meters of that
side of the vehicle must make an Evasion save for half
damage. Those within 20 meters take half damage, and
can make an Evasion save to take none at all. Wheatcutter belts do not ignore a vehicle’s Armor like other
Heavy weapons do. Reloading a wheatcutter belt costs
200 credits per round.
Vortex cannons use controlled gravitic shear planes
to cause a target to simply fall apart into component
fragments. The cannons are silent in operation, but so
heavy and complex that they can only be mounted on
gravtanks and other similar dedicated fighting vehicles.

70• GENERAL EQUIPMENT

GENERAL EQUIPMENT
Most of the equipment listed here is available on any
TL4 world. Even the TL5 items are among the simpler
and more ubiquitous pretech relics and could likely
be acquired on a sufficiently prosperous world with a
good market in Mandate tech. Buying any TL5 equipment on the open market is subject to GM approval,
however, and many worlds are flatly ban private ownership of ancient Mandate technology.
Some encumbrance entries are marked with an
asterisk. Such items have no significant encumbrance
and dozens can be carried without hindrance.
Other entries are marked with a hashmark. These
objects can be conveniently packed together in a smaller, more portable package. Three such objects can be
packed together as a single encumbrance item. For
ammunition, one loaded magazine counts as one item.
Breaking open such a package to get at the contents
takes a Main Action, however, before they can be
Readied with another Main Action.
