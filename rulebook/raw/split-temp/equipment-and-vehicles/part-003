Ammo and Power

Communications

The finest product of a 33rd-century armory is useless
if it lacks the bullets or power cells to feed it. For ease
of play, ammunition can be used interchangeably with
any projectile weapon. Power cells are designed along
Mandate-era lines that allow for easy compatibility
among devices from different worlds.

Almost all TL4 worlds have a planetary communications grid compatible with any standard compad. Some
planets are less technologically gifted, however, or have
local conditions that preclude easy wireless communication. Other times, the PCs have reason to avoid
leaving call logs that might come back to haunt them.

Ammunition: A few worlds are too primitive or too
resource-poor to manufacture ammunition, but
the vast majority of worlds provide cartridges in
almost every conceivable caliber and make. Most
local gunsmiths can load ammunition to any specification required by a buyer.
Ammunition, missile: Some characters might have reason to pack along a man-portable rocket launcher,
or have one mounted on their favorite gravcar.
Heavy weapons and their ammunition are usually
outlawed for civilians on most worlds, but this
price is for locales where missiles can be bought.
Power cells: One of the few standardized artifacts inherited from before the Silence, power cells are
small cylindrical objects designed to take and hold
electrical charges. Type A cells are usually used for
personal equipment, and the larger type B cells
for vehicles and heavy gear. The engineering for
the cells is substantially different, and they cannot
be exchanged or recharge each other without a
trained tech’s modifications or a converter unit.
Power cells can be recharged off a ship’s power
plant or other grid. Recharging requires 30 minutes for a type A cell or 24 hours for a type B cell.
Solar recharger: This recharger unfolds into a 2 meter
by 2 meter square field of solar cells. Granted a
primary star of roughly Earth-like intensity, it can
recharge one type A power cell per day.
Telekinetic generator: While this device assumes the
presence of a trained telekinetic, it isn’t strictly
psitech, as its operation is quite simple. A telekinetic user pushes a resistance bar within the generator, causing a flow of electricity to recharge an
attached power cell. Any telekinetic with Telekinesis-1 skill or better can recharge a cell with fifteen minutes of concentration. In an emergency, a
character with at least Strength 10 can operate the
generator manually, though they need to succeed
on a difficulty 8 Con/Exert skill check in order to
keep up the pace for an hour. Failure means that
the character must rest for at least an hour before
trying again. The generator can charge one type
A power cell at a time.

Comm server: A powerful base unit for providing communications without comsats. The server provides service between up to three dozen compads
within 300 kilometers of the unit. Server usage
can be locked to specific compads, and all transmissions are heavily encrypted. A comm server
can function for several months on a type B cell.
Compad: One of a host of different hand-held portable
communications devices. Most TL4 worlds have
global comm coverage, but primitive worlds render these devices useless without a nearby comm
server to provide connectivity.
Field Radio: On worlds too primitive to have a comm
grid, adventurers often fall back on these headset-mounted field radios. A single type A cell
powers them for months of use. Urban or rugged
terrain limits their range to about two kilometers,
while flat plains give a maximum range of thirty kilometers. Someone with at least Program-0
skill can use the radio’s shortwave functionality
to communicate with a prepared target at continental distances if given ten minutes for tuning.
Translator torc: Each translator torc is keyed for two
languages, and will automatically translate what it
hears in one into speech in the other. The translations are eccentric in many cases, and there is
always a several-second delay between each statement and its translation. Any attempts to exert
social skills or Charisma through a translator torc
suffer a -2 skill check penalty. The torc is powered
by one type A power cell, which lasts for one week
of regular use.

72• GENERAL EQUIPMENT

Computing Gear

Computing devices are ubiquitous on most TL4 worlds,
though not all of them have the kind of planetary network known on 21st century Terra. Would-be hackers
often find it necessary to take a very personal hand in
breaching site security.
Black slab: While a “black slab” appears to be a normal
dataslab to casual examination, these devices are
packed with intrusion-optimization hardware
and integral line tapping tools. They function as
a metatool for purposes of accessing data lines and
grant a +1 bonus to all hacking attempts made
with them. They are also quite illegal on most
worlds, available only from black market dealers
and private sales from hackers.
Data phase tap: This handheld device is normally illegal
outside the possession of licensed data line repair
technicians. The tap can detect data lines within five meters through up to ten centimeters of
ordinary walls, and can generate an energy manipulation field that allows tapping that data line
for hacking purposes without physically damaging
the wall.
Data protocol: Not so much a device as a collection of
standard manuals on a world’s particular data formats and security methodologies. The price listed here are for black-market manuals on worlds
where this information is rigidly restricted. On
less paranoid planets, the equivalent information
can be acquired for free.
Dataslab: A palm-sized computing device that can unfold into a thin slab roughly one-third of a meter
on a side. It can perform all the functions of a compad or handheld computer and can communicate
wirelessly with nearby devices.
Line shunt: These palm-sized discs are roughly one centimeter in thickness, with an adhesive side that
will stick to virtually anything and a polychromatic phased compound on its shell which will shift
color to blend with its surroundings. One or more
line shunts must be applied at specific locations
within a site to access the more well-defended varieties of computerized systems. Shunts employ
phased energy manipulation tech, and so do not
need to be directly in contact with a data line but
only within a few centimeters. Line shunts are
single-use, and keep functioning until removed.
Remote link unit: These data broadcast link units have
been preloaded with one-time pad security measures, advanced stealth circuitry, and sophisticated
data progression algorithms. Two of these links
can allow a user to maintain contact with a remote
data storage unit. The connection is too “stiff” to
allow for easy hacking, however, and it applies a
-2 penalty to any attempts to hack through it. Professional-grade security systems often have means
to detect the broadcast of a remote link unit.

Stiletto charge: These ancient Mandate-era polymorphic intrusion charges were originally made to allow Mandate agents to easily overcome primitive
colonial data security measures. Each charge is a
small interface plug the size of a human thumb.
When used as part of a hack against a TL4 system,
it causes the skill check to automatically succeed
regardless of the difficulty. Without line shunts,
however, the duration of the hack is still no more
than the usual 1d4 rounds plus the hacker’s Program skill. These devices are single-use, and are
prized so highly that they are almost always unavailable for conventional purchase. Favors to the
right people and the looting of Mandate remnants
are the only normal ways to acquire these devices.
Storage unit: While conventional dataslabs have ample space to hold any reasonable amount of data,
sometimes a party needs to store or acquire a truly
huge dataset. This standard TL4 storage unit is a
portable but clumsy case hardened against anything short of intentional damage with a firearm,
capable of interfacing with a wide variety of hardware to receive and upload data. A single storage
unit can hold a tremendous amount of data that
has been carefully compressed and optimized for
it. If the user is simply ripping a database off a
network and stuffing it into the unit, it can absorb
up to a small corporation’s complete files.
Tightbeam link unit: Much like a remote link unit, a
tightbeam unit uses a laser to connect via lineof-sight transmission. Unlike a remote link unit,
there’s almost no chance for a conventional security system to detect this link, but it requires that
the infiltrators get a clear line of sight between
the unit and the receiving end. Commercial satellite reception units can be employed for skyward
aiming at 500 credits/hour if a second land unit is
unavailable, but indoor use is impossible.

Foreign Protocols
Most surviving human worlds continue to use a
basic Mandate-derived communications protocol
that ensures a minimal level of compatibility between hardware from different worlds. While the
performance may not be ideal, tech purchased on
one world should still be able to interface with the
local tech on a different planet.
Even so, a few worlds of a more xenophobic
or isolated nature intentionally abandon this standard protocol in favor of their own. PC hardware
on these worlds will not communicate with the
local grid unless a PC with Program or Fix skills
has a chance to reset the protocols to something
compatible with local conditions. Such work usually takes at least a day to adjust all the gear the
group might possess.

GENERAL EQUIPMENT •73

Pharmaceuticals

Modern pharmaceuticals are usually applied as “stims”;
small capsules that are pressed against the target’s skin
for application. While a wide variety of common overthe-counter stims are available, the ones listed below
are some particularly likely to be useful to adventurers.
Many medical stims require a minimum level in the
Heal skill to successfully apply them, while others add
System Strain to the target as described on page 32. If a
subject’s System Strain is too high already, the stim has
no positive effect. Some of the combat stims below are
usually illegal for civilian possession, but street sources
are available at the prices given.
Modern vacc suits and powered armor have medical ports that allow for applying stims and other medical treatment without removing the suit.
Bezoar (Heal-1): A complex antibiotic cocktail, Bezoar
is an effective default treatment for a wide variety
of infectious diseases. When applied to a sufferer, roll 1d6; on a 1, this victim cannot be helped
by Bezoar, while otherwise the affliction is cured
within 24 hours. Each application of Bezoar adds
1 System Strain to the target, and it cannot cure
cancers, bioweapons, or congenital diseases.
Brainwave (Heal-2): This psitech drug requires advanced TL5 facilities to compound, and the few
remaining doses from pre-Silence periods are
rarely available on the open market. Application
of Brainwave gives a psychic 2 extra maximum
Effort for one hour. At the end of that hour, they
suffer 4 points of System Strain. If their Strain is
maximized by this, they go unconscious for one
hour. Only one dose can be active at a time.
Hush (Heal-0): An extremely heavy neurotranquilizer,
Hush leaves the subject awake and responsive to
simple, untaxing commands. They cannot fight
or communicate while affected by Hush, but will
walk, eat, sit, and perform simple actions as directed by the last person to speak to them. A Hush
dose lasts for an hour plus three per Heal level of
the person applying the stim, and the subject retains no memories while under the effect. A subject must be immobilized or willing to be affected
by Hush; violent physical movement immediately
after application disrupts the neurological effects.
Lift (Heal-0): A Lift stim augments and amplifies the
body’s natural response to physical injury and exhaustion. This boost speeds natural recovery drastically and heals 1d8 plus the user’s Heal skill in
hit points after five minutes of rest. Lift stims do
not work on PCs who are mortally wounded; they
need to be stabilized before the Lift can help them,
though application to a stabilized target will get
them back on their feet and active again. Each application adds 1 System Strain to the target. Each
additional application of Lift to a target the same
day increases the minimum Heal skill needed by 1.

Pretech Cosmetic (None): Before the Silence stims existed for a host of cosmetic, hygiene, and health
purposes. While these effects are trivial, the basic
pretech stim substrate also works to heal 1d6 lost
hit points in the user at a cost of 1 System Strain.
Psych (None): A military drug duplicated in rougher
form by many street chemists, Psych fills the user
with an intense sense of confidence and reckless courage. Unfortunately, it also cripples their
judgment regarding danger. A person affected by
Psych immediately gains a Morale score of 12 and
a +1 bonus on all skill checks, but will ignore cover
during combat and cannot decide not to attempt a
skill check after learning its difficulty. The effect
lasts fifteen minutes, adds 1 System Strain to the
user, and is highly psychologically addictive.
Reverie (Heal-1): This very dangerous combat drug
completely subdues the subject’s fear centers and
adrenaline production, leaving them perfectly calm and relaxed even in the midst of mortal
danger. Their reaction speed is much slower as a
consequence, and they may act only on even-numbered combat rounds; so on the second, fourth,
and sixth rounds and so forth. Any damage they
suffer is doubled as well due to their lack of vigilance. Their perfect calm allows them to shoot as
if on the target range, however, and they can make
Dex/Shoot skill checks to hit a target instead of
hit rolls; the difficulty is 7 at point blank, 9 at normal ranges, and 11 at long ranges for the weapon.
The target’s Armor Class is ignored. Melee attacks
made under Reverie always hit. Reverie lasts for
ten minutes and adds 2 System Strain to the target.
Squeal (Heal-1): This “truth serum” is unreliable but still
one of the best available options for field interrogations. The subject must be immobilized or willing to be affected by it. For five minutes afterwards
they will be unable to avoid answering questions
about facts known to them; they will be unable
to exercise anything resembling a hypothesis or a
judgment, but they will answer specific questions
about facts known to them truthfully. Unwilling
victims can attempt a Physical saving throw; on
a success, they can simply refuse to speak about
one particular topic of their choice. Targets pass
out for 1d6 hours after the drug wears off and are
immune to it for a week thereafter.
Tsunami (Heal-1): An emergency combat stim used to
juice certain expendable soldiers before an assault,
Tsunami fills them with a reckless disregard for
pain and an intense aggressiveness. The short
effect duration and difficult application limits its
wider use, however. Subjects gain a Morale score
of 12, 10 extra hit points for ten minutes and a +2
