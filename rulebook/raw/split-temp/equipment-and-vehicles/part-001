A combat field uniform is sophisticated battle dress
fabricated from TL4 ablative coatings, rigid plates, and
shock-activated soft components. The CFU is the standard uniform for well-equipped TL4 front-line soldiers.
The Icarus harness is a CFU upgrade for paratroopers, and replaces a conventional parachute with
a crude gravity damper that allows the wearer to fall
an unlimited distance without harm. Each fall over 3
meters drains a type A power cell. The suit also functions as a vacc suit for up to 30 minutes per vacc refresh.
A “vestimentum” is a catch-all term for one of the
many ancient Mandate ceremonial armors meant
chiefly for parade guards, ritual officiants, cultural
reenactors, or other roles that put elaborate style at a
premium. While these outfits often look wildly unmilitary, their hyper-advanced components and micronized force fields give them the same protection against
primitive weapons as any other powered armor.
An assault suit represents the most sophisticated
armor in common use among TL4 worlds. An assault
suit requires a type B power cell for 24 hours of operation, and provides integral encrypted military comms,
low-light and infrared vision, and a built-in energy
feed interface. The latter allows the wearer to connect
the suit to any one weapon or device that uses a type
A power cell as a Main Action. So long as the device
remains connected to the suit, it is treated as having
unlimited ammunition or operation time. The suit also

functions as a vacc suit so long as it remains powered,
one that cannot be torn by edged weapons.
Storm armor is a more advanced form of assault
suit, one that can be fabricated only by those worlds
that have retained some degree of Mandate-grade
technical infrastructure. Aside from functioning as an
assault suit, the storm armor’s exo-augments allow the
wearer to treat their Strength as 4 points higher for
encumbrance purposes. Integral gravitic boosters allow
the wearer to leap up to 20 meters as a Move action,
either horizontally or vertically, and allow the wearer
to fall up to 40 meters without suffering harm. An onboard medical computer can attempt last-ditch stabilization of the wearer if all other efforts fail; when the
wearer would normally die from an untreated mortal
wound, they can make a Physical save to self-stabilize.
Storm armor requires the same type B power cell as an
assault suit, and each cell powers it for 24 hours.
A field emitter panoply is a heavy-duty pretech
defensive system composed of a half-dozen worn
emitter nodes that sheath the wearer in a nimbus of
close-fitting damper fields. The FEP’s pale glow is obvious, but it provides all the benefits of storm armor
with no power source required. The FEP is particularly
effective at filtering radiation, and renders the wearer
immune to any dose that wouldn’t kill them in seconds.
Many FEPs project intimidating holographic skins over
the wearer when in operation.

RANGED WEAPONS
Ranged weaponry makes up the majority of the lethal
implements that litter the galaxy. Whether the primitive bows of a remnant colony on some desolate lost
world or the sophisticated energy weapons of a modern interstellar freebooter, the ability to kill people at
a comfortable distance is universally prized.
One Type A power cell is sufficient to recharge an
energy weapon’s magazine. For simplicity during play,
ammunition calibers aren’t tracked; a bullet is a bullet
when it comes to feeding your favorite gun.
Weapons are listed with their normal and maximum range in meters. Attacks beyond normal range
take a -2 penalty to hit rolls.

Burst Mode

Some weaponry can fire in burst mode, allowing the
wielder to fire three rounds of ammunition for a +2 bonus to hit and damage against the target. For projectile
weapons, this means firing actual bullets, while energy
weapons spread the beam or run the circuits hot to
project additional power. Dumping more ammunition
than this at once is generally impractical; energy weapons would melt down and projectile launchers would
buck uncontrollably. True suppressive fire is usually
only possible with Heavy weapons.

Projectile Weaponry

Projectile weapons are by far the most common ranged
weapons in human use. Even comparatively primitive
worlds can fabricate and maintain such weaponry, and
the damage a flying chunk of hot lead can do is often
worse than what a clean burst of laser fire might produce. Almost any world of TL2 or higher can provide
projectile ammunition. Most sophisticated modern
ammunition works even in vacuum conditions.
Bows are uncommon weapons in the far future,
though some lostworlder barbarians have nothing better. Some sophisticated “conversion bows” use special
materials to convert the kinetic energy of the draw into
a force field “glazing” around the arrow, improving
penetration. Bows can be reloaded with a Move action,
or faster if the Gunslinger focus is applied.
Grenade users always roll to attack AC 10. On a
miss, the grenade lands 1d10 meters away from the
target in a random direction. Hit or miss, the grenade
then explodes for 2d6 damage to all targets within 5
meters. Victims are allowed an Evasion save for half
damage. Targets take 1 less point of damage for each
point of AC above 14. Grenades can be thrown with
the Exert skill instead of Shoot, if desired.
Crude pistols and muskets represent the rawest and
most primitive forms of gunpowder weaponry, usually
makeshift weapons improvised by criminals or the desperate. Reloading a crude pistol or a musket requires
two rounds instead of one.

Revolvers are quite popular on frontier worlds, as
the weapons are extremely reliable and can be repaired
and manufactured even by primitive metallurgists.
Some revolver variants are specially built to handle
atmospheres that would destroy more fragile weapons.
Rifles are the mainstays of most TL2 armies and
hunters, thanks to their superior range and power.
Shotguns are cheaper and more easily manufactured than rifles, and are popular weapons for home
defense on the frontier. The statistics given are for shot
ammunition. Slug rounds do 2d6 damage and have
ranges of 50/75 meters.
Semi-automatic pistols trade some of the reliability
of the revolver for a larger magazine size. They tend to
be the favorite sidearm for locals on planets that lack
the harsh conditions or uncertain maintenance opportunities of a frontier world.
Submachine guns take pistol ammunition but fire
it at a high rate of speed. These weapons can fire in
burst mode.
Combat rifles are favored by the militaries of tech
level 3 worlds, trading some of the often-unnecessary
range and penetration of a conventional rifle for a
larger ammunition capacity and burst fire capabilities.
On more strait-laced worlds such military weaponry is
often illegal for civilians to possess.
Combat shotguns are more complicated and temperamental versions of conventional shotguns. These
weapons have substantially larger ammunition capacity
and are capable of firing in burst mode. Combat shotguns can fire slug rounds just as normal shotguns.
Sniper rifles are designed to be exceptionally effective at dropping unsuspecting targets at long range.
Aside from the additional effective range of a sniper
rifle, any target it mortally wounds via an execution
attack will die instantly, with no chance for stabilization. The execution attack must qualify according to
the terms on page 52. If the rifle is used outside of such
conditions, it has no special qualities.
Void carbines are designed for vacuum and zero-gee use, and have essentially no recoil. Their rounds
cannot penetrate ordinary ship equipment plating.
Mag weaponry involves the magnetic acceleration
of metal flechettes, while spike throwers are the shotgun equivalents of these weapons. Mag ammunition is
packaged with integral power supplies, so no additional
power cells are necessary to fire these weapons.

Energy Weaponry

While the heavy metal slugs and flechettes thrown by
projectile weaponry tend to be more damaging, the lack
of recoil for non-Heavy energy weapons makes them
more accurate, granting them a +1 bonus to hit rolls.
Energy weapons are very popular on more advanced worlds, as a soldier can carry far more ammu-

nition in the form of energy cells than they can carry
bullets. Range and accuracy are often superior, though
the infrastructure necessary for maintenance and repair
of these weapons is substantially higher.
Pistol-sized energy weapons count as one item of
encumbrance, while rifles, thunder guns, plasma projectors, and distortion cannons count as two items.
Laser pistols and laser rifles are the most common
type of energy weapon, though pistols are considerably
less energy-efficient. Depending on the tech used in the
sector, they might produce silent, invisible beams of
death or noisy, brightly-colored streaks of lethal light.
The phased multifrequency beam is capable of penetrating any ordinary mist or haze, but a thick cloud of
thermally-resistant particulate matter such as ash or
sand can seriously degrade the beam, applying up to a
-4 penalty to hit and cutting ranges in half.
Thermal pistols and their larger, two-handed plasma projector cousins replace the beam of a laser with
a small sphere of magnetically-shaped plasma. The
spheres tend to dissipate at much shorter ranges than
a laser beam, but do significantly more damage to targets within range and are not affected by ambient particulates. They tend to be extremely loud in operation.

Shear rifles are the product of a relatively few
functioning pretech manufactories. These weapons
use miniaturized grav projectors to create dangerous
repulsor fields inside a target, tearing the object apart
along perfectly smooth planes. Shear rifles are completely silent in operation.
Thunder guns are named for the basso vibrations
caused by their operation, a sound that can be felt
as far as thirty meters away from an operator. This
two-handed weapon uses grav plates to create rapid,
randomized disruptions in a target that increase the
chance of complete structural collapse. If a thunder gun
hits a target with an unmodified hit roll of 16 or higher an extra 1d10 damage is rolled. This bonus damage
always applies to inanimate targets.
Distortion cannons are among the most sophisticated man-portable weapons designed before the Scream.
These two-handed energy weapons rely on the same
principle as does a spike drive, manipulating the underlying fabric of space to disrupt a target. Provided
the wielder can see a target within range or accurately
