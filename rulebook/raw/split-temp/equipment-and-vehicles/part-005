to use some form of biofuel unless they’re fortunate
enough to have a supply of fossil fuels. Vehicles require
one cell or one refueling per six hours of operation,
assuming they don’t have convenient power access.
Vehicles are generally limited to reasonably flat,
dry terrain. Grav vehicles such as hovercycles can ignore rough terrain and calm water, as can ATV explorers. Most grav vehicles can boost more than 10 meters
above the ground or water; gravflyers are purpose-designed aircraft capable of hovering and VTOL.
Speed is an abstract measure of the vehicle’s speed
and agility. When vehicles chase each other, the opposing vehicle’s Speed should be applied as a penalty
to Pilot skill checks to close or escape. Speed may also
be used as a modifier when attempting difficult maneuvers or trying to avoid a peril on the road.
Armor is subtracted from all weapon damage done
to the vehicle. Armor does not apply to damage done
by Heavy weaponry; such guns are often designed to
take out vehicles. Gravtanks in particular are immune
to anything short of TL4 Heavy weapons, while less
sophisticated tanks are immune to anything below TL3
Heavy ordnance.

Actually hitting the vehicle is automatic if the
vehicle is stationary and within 30 feet. Hitting a vehicle-sized target from beyond that range requires an
attack against AC 10. If the target is moving, subtract
its Speed from the hit roll, and if the attacker is in a
moving vehicle as well, also subtract their Speed.
Hit Points indicate the amount of damage a vehicle
can take before it is destroyed. Speed is reduced by half
when the vehicle is at half hit points, and flying vehicles
must land at the first opportunity. A vehicle reduced to
zero hit points forces all crew and passengers to make
Physical saving throws. Failure means that the passenger takes the vehicle’s maximum hit points in damage,
while success reduces the damage by half.
Crew gives the maximum number of vehicle occupants. For the listed vehicles, only one crew member is
actually necessary to drive or pilot the vehicle, though
additional crew members may be required to fire.
Tonnage is the shipping weight of the vehicle for
ship loading purposes.
Tech Level indicates the minimum tech level for
constructing the vehicle. Vehicles can be built at higher
tech levels for better performance, but most worlds
prefer to simply build more advanced vehicles.

Vehicle Weaponry

Most vehicles larger than a motorcycle or hovercycle
can mount some kind of integral weapon. Groundcars
and gravcars can mount one weapon, while ATVs,
helicopters, atmoflyers, and gravflyers can mount two.
Gravtanks are specialized weapons platforms, and can
mount six.
Heavy weapons take up more space than ordinary
ranged weapons, and each such system takes up the
space of two lesser guns.
Every weapon requires its own gunner, and all
mounted weapons use Shoot as the firing skill, though
the GM might allow Pilot to be used for a nose-mounted weapon aimed by the operator. Gravtanks are
equipped with advanced targeting systems, and all of
their weapons can be targeted and fired by one gunner.

Types of Vehicles

Every world has its own brands of common vehicles,
but the types below cover the more usual models. The
prices given for each reflect a mid-range new vehicle
sold to a PC with few local contacts. Natives who know
the right people or are willing to buy used or “quirky”
vehicles might be able to get one at half that price.

Motorcycles can navigate urban terrain that would
block larger vehicles, but more rural landscapes can
prove more difficult. Hovercycles are the TL4 equivalent, capable of brief boosts of up to 10 meters above
the ground and the easy navigation of all but thick forests or sheer slopes.
Groundcars are the TL3 analogs of the vehicles
commonly in use on 21st-century Earth, allowing for
some minor variations in electronics and capabilities.
Primitive buggies of various kinds are found even on
higher-tech worlds, thanks to their ease of construction
and maintenance compared to the delicate gravitics of
more modern vehicles.
Gravcars are the standard personal vehicles of
most TL4 worlds, though most lower-class citizens
rely on public transport in urban areas. Most advanced
worlds have planetary transit grids that allow occupants to simply code in a destination and let the car take
them there. On worlds where a lack of infrastructure
or hostile local conditions preclude such convenience,
manual controls and Pilot skill can be used.
ATV Explorers are rugged vehicles, either wheeled
or tracked, and driven by type B power cells or locally-available biofuels. While they can’t navigate rough

terrain as easily as a grav vehicle, they’re designed
to take a tremendous amount of punishment before
breaking down and support repairs using basic tools
and frontier expedients.
Helicopters are used on TL3 worlds where a lack
of airfields or treacherous local terrain prohibits the
use of fixed-wing craft. Their ability to hover over an
area or drop onto a tightly-constrained landing zone
makes them particular favorites of quick-response military forces and groups in need of fast fire support. This
model represents a medium-weight civilian craft that
might be repurposed by militia or adventurers.
Atmoflyers are the fixed-wing aircraft used on
planets too primitive to have developed gravitic technology. Faster and simpler to maintain than comparable helicopters, they can also carry more cargo on most
worlds. The need for clear, hard terrain for landing and
take-off limit their use on some rugged worlds. The
model here is meant to represent a small personal jet.
Gravflyers are the usual long-distance transport
on most TL4 worlds. Large enough to support the gravitics required for true flight, a few models can even
reach low orbit. All can hover and climb with typical
gravitic ease. This particular gravflyer is a small craft
suitable for a affluent owner and their family.
Gravtanks make up the bulk of a prosperous TL4
world’s armored forces. Private ownership is strictly
forbidden on most worlds, but “export models” often
can be acquired for transport offworld. Gravtanks have
armor heavy enough to ignore all damage from conventional small arms, and can only be harmed by Heavy
weapons or properly-placed demolitions charges.

80• DRONES

DRONES
In the far future, it’s often more convenient to send
an expendable grav-flying probe into danger before
venturing less repairable assets. Well-prepared adventuring groups often have reason to pack along a drone
or two for exploring and aerial recon.
Military use of drones is limited by the ubiquitous
use of quantum ECM. The easy confusion of electronic
navigation makes it impossible to control an unwired
drone remotely on a modern battlefield or in proximity
to important civil structures, but in the alien wilds or
away from urban centers, drones remain a feasible tool
for explorers and conquerors of primitive militaries.

Piloting a Drone

Piloting a drone requires either a cybernetic drone control link as described on page 83 or a handheld control
unit that comes with the drone. A control link can pilot
up to one drone plus the user’s Program skill at any
one time. Handheld units can pilot only one. Drones
consume one type A power cell for every hour of use.
A pilot must spend their Main Action each round
to command the drone to either move or shoot. Uncommanded drones remain stationary if piloted via
control link, while handheld units run a 2-in-6 chance
of crashing a drone if the operator fails to control them.
In combat, drones fly at 30 meters per round on
their pilot’s turn in combat. Out of combat, they can
manage up to 100 kilometers per hour.
Spotting a drone at observation range is a Wis/
Notice skill check at difficulty 10. A drone close enough
to engage a target can be spotted at difficulty 8. Any
secure facility will have sensors capable of detecting
a civilian drone as soon as it gets within observation
range, unless the drone has stealth fittings.

Drone Combat

A drone’s pilot can activate up to one weapon the drone
is carrying as part of their Main Action to control it
each round. Weapons all use Intelligence as the controlling attribute, and use the better of the pilot’s Pilot
or Program skills as the relevant weapon skill. The
drone shoots using the pilot’s base attack bonus.

Drone Types and Statistics

Each drone has a cost, a maximum number of fittings,
an Encumbrance weight for carrying it along, a hit
point rating, a maximum control range, and a minimum tech level. Drones may be attacked as any other
object and will crash once reduced to zero hit points.
Primitive drones represent the best flying portable
drone technology for TL3 worlds. While fragile, weak,
and short-ranged, they are also relatively cheap.
Void Hawks are unique in being built specifically for deep-space use. Unlike other drones, they can
operate perfectly well in space, though they only have
the range to reach relatively adjacent ships or objects.
Stalker drones are the default TL4 workhorses of
drone-kind and are available on most modern worlds.
Cuttlefish are specifically designed for aqueous use,
and function only in a liquid medium. The support of
the liquid allows them to carry significantly more fittings, but the need for a sonar-based navigation system
limits their available range.
Ghostwalkers are stealth drones, fabricated from
radar-transparent materials. They have an integral Sensor Transparency fitting and the sensor difficulty to spot
them is 11 instead of 9.
Sleeper drones are built to tarry on station for
long periods. They have the Stationkeeping fitting as
an integral part of their design, and when hovering
their power use slows to a trickle. One day of hovering
draws only five minutes worth of power from its cell.
Pax drones are some of the most common pretech
drones remaining in existence, as they were favored by
the Mandate Fleet for pacifying troublesome worlds
that lacked quantum ECM. While primitive by pretech
standards, they still far excel most modern drones.
The Alecto model of drone examples one way that
pretech scientists attempted to sidestep the limits of
quantum ECM on the modern battlefield. Every Alecto
is a full-fledged VI, an expert system so sophisticated as
to seem almost sentient. Its self-reinforcing cognition
allows it to operate even when cut off from external
signals by quantum ECM. Salvaged Alectos have all
exhibited “female” personalities.

Drone Fittings and Repair

Aside from the basic drone chassis, operators can attach
different fittings to a drone to add additional capabilities. Once attached, a fitting cannot be removed without causing severe structural damage to the drone. If
a drone is destroyed, all fittings are destroyed with it.
If a drone is damaged, it can be repaired fully with
one unit of spare parts per five hit points lost and an
hour’s work by someone with at least Fix-0 skill.
Ammo Unit: The drone carries one power cell or magazine worth of ammunition for each of its onboard
weapons, whether single or multiple. The operator can reload an ammo unit as a Main Action.
Bomber: The drone is fitted to drop up to two grenade-sized explosives, one or both in lieu of a different weapon attack. Dropping a grenade from
more than 30 meters up automatically causes the
grenade to scatter from its intended target point.
Environmental Power: The drone draws operating
power from sunlight or thermal variances. It can
operate indefinitely so long as it can draw power
from its environment.
Expert System: The drone is loaded with sophisticated self-piloting software. It can be given a flight
plan by its operator, have targets designated for
its weapon, and respond to simple environmental
cues. Each new command takes up a Main Action and commands with any conditional states
may require an Int/Program skill check to get the
drone to understand. The drone can fire only one
weapon per round and uses a total attack bonus of
+2 if attacking autonomously. Quantum ECM will
scramble this lightweight system.
Extended Flight: The drone can now carry a second type
A cell to fuel its flight. This fitting can be taken
multiple times to further extend its range.
Grav Muffles: The drone is made exceptionally quiet in
operation. It is now inaudible by ordinary hearing
from more than five meters away.
Heavy Lift: While most drones can lift no more than
a kilogram of excess weight, the drone’s gravitic
units have been upgraded to carry up to twenty
kilos of cargo. This can be fitted multiple times.
Holoskin: The drone can drop a filmy hologram over itself, one convincing at a distance. The difficulty of
visually spotting the drone becomes 10 at weapons
range or 12 at observational range. Weapons fire
always draws attention.
Medical Support: The drone can be loaded with up to
a dozen units of medication, whether stim doses,
lazarus patches, or less benevolent substances. It
can launch a medication through a remote injector
at a target within ten meters in lieu of a weapon
attack. Immobile or willing targets are hit automatically, while hostiles require a normal hit roll.
The drone is treated as having Heal-0 skill or the
active pilot’s Heal skill, whichever is higher.
