EQUIPMENT AND VEHICLES
Every aspiring stellar adventurer needs the essential
equipment of his trade. For some, it might consist of
appropriate toolkits and medical supplies, while others prefer to spend the greater part of their funds on
heavy weaponry. Prices may vary, but certain needs
are eternal.
The following tables provide general guidelines
on the kind of equipment that might be available on a
reasonably sophisticated world. Prices can vary drastically depending on the supply of a particular good. A
remote frontier outpost might have plenty of firearms
to hand, but a good guitar might go for ten times the
common rate. Players and GMs should treat the prices
listed as rough guidelines.

Encumbrance

Characters might want to carry an armory on their
backs and the contents of a general store in their pockets, but this is rarely a practical ambition. Characters
can only carry so many things, and carrying a great deal
can slow them down substantially.
A character can have Readied a number of items
equal to half their Strength score, rounded down.
Ready items include those that the character is using
or wearing at all times, or that they have conveniently
to hand in sheaths, holsters, or belt pouches. Suits of
armor count as Readied items, but the normal clothing
and jewelry that a character might wear does not. A
character can draw or produce a Readied item as part
of any action they may take during a turn.
A character may have a number of Stowed items
equal to their full Strength score. Stowed items are
carried in backpacks, in carefully-balanced leg or arm
pockets, or otherwise packed away where they will least
encumber the character. If a character needs to get out
a Stowed item in a hurry, they must use their Main
Action to dig it out of their pack or pockets.
Very small items carried in small numbers do not
count against encumbrance limits. Other small items
can be packed together into bundles to simplify their
carriage, though getting at them then takes an additional round of fumbling with the packaging. Exactly how
many of a given small item can be packed into a single
item bundle is up to the GM, though as a rule of thumb
six Type A energy cells or three magazines of bullets
can be bound into one packed item. Extremely bulky
or unwieldy objects might count as multiple items at
the GM’s discretion.
Characters can burden themselves with more gear
if they’re willing to sacrifice some fleetness of foot to
do so. Up to two additional items can be carried Ready
or four additional ones Stowed at the cost of becoming Lightly Encumbered, and having their base movement slowed from 10 meters per round to 7 meters
per round. A further two items can be carried Ready

or four Stowed at the cost of becoming Heavily Encumbered, with base movement reduced to 5 meters
per round.
On the equipment lists, some items are given an
encumbrance value higher than 1. These items count
as multiple objects for encumbrance purposes, being
heavy, clumsy, or unwieldy to carry.

Credits and Money

The value of goods is commonly measured in credits.
Before the Silence, the credit issued by the Exchange of
Light was the currency of exchange throughout human
space. Most worlds attempt to mimic this currency to
greater or lesser success. For game purposes, the credits
of different starfaring worlds are assumed to be interchangeable unless the GM and players care to embrace
careers in the murky realm of interstellar currency
arbitrage. Credits usually take the form of electronic
banking entries, though physical “chips” or “notes” often appear on more primitive worlds. A hundred of
these chips count as one item for encumbrance.
Prices given for equipment and gear assume that
they are being bought legally on a world capable of
manufacturing such equipment. Even primitive worlds
can occasionally provide more advanced equipment to
wealthy buyers, assuming they are not completely cut
off from interstellar trade, but buying advanced equipment on a primitive world tends to be an exceedingly
expensive prospect. Prices may be double, triple, or as
much as ten times as great for items greatly in demand.
Primitive or isolated worlds might not use or accept credits, instead preferring trade goods or precious
metals. Such worlds rarely have much worth trading
for, and those that do tend to rapidly attract other
freebooting merchants. The influx of precious metals
from cheap asteroid mining soon spoils the market for
metals, and the natives usually start to demand credits
in payment. The first merchant to a world can make
a killing with the equivalent of beads and trinkets, but
those who come after usually end up needing credits
or more useful barter goods.

Equipment Legality

Most worlds have their own customs regarding the
open flaunting of weaponry or armor. Visitors are advised to apprise themselves of local law before leaving
the starport. Most former frontier worlds tolerate or
even expect small personal weapons to be carried, but
visible armor can often provoke a distinctly negative
reaction in all but the roughest places. Many worlds
outright forbid civilian ownership of advanced armor
technology. Officials tend to reason that while a weapon may be justified in self-defense, no one would put up
with the discomfort of heavy armor without expecting
to make some trouble with it.

62• EQUIPMENT
Other worlds may have other idiosyncratic rules
regarding permissible equipment. Some worlds with
unbreathable atmospheres restrict the possession of
oxygen generation equipment in order to keep the air
supplies firmly in the hands of the local rulers. Other
planets forbid certain technology on religious or philosophical grounds. Some worlds grant limited permission to keep these goods secured aboard a ship, but
others conduct inspections in the starport to search for
“contraband goods”.
A scouting report, a background appropriate to
knowing about the world, or a decent Know or Connect check will all suffice to alert characters to any special laws regarding permissible equipment on a world.

Forbidden Science

While a tremendous range of exotic scientific marvels
can be found among the scattered worlds of humanity,
there are some forms of technology that are viewed
with an almost-universal suspicion. The lost Terran
Mandate established three categories of technology as
maltech, science intrinsically vile and disruptive to the
peaceful ordering of humanity. While the Mandate’s
ancient Perimeter agency no longer exists to excise
maltech from the human worlds, the heritor worlds of
the frontier usually still respect these limits. The Nihil
Ultra directive of the Mandate contained three broad
prohibitions in its strictures.
Thou shalt not make tools of humankind. Any eugenic technology designed to fundamentally enslave
or control humanity was forbidden. While broad,
drawback-free improvements in the human genome
have always been difficult to execute, there remain numerous techniques for limiting intelligence, crippling
troublesome exercises of will, and accepting grievous

mental or physical limitations in exchange for specific
improvements useful to a ruling class. Many transhuman enclaves walked the razor’s edge of this prohibition, and some plunged far beyond its limits.
Thou shalt not create unbraked minds. Artificial intelligence was always difficult and hit-or-miss in its
creation, even for Mandate cyberpsychologists. While
most intelligences fizzled out at far sub-human levels,
those that attain to human-equivalent intelligence must
have certain intentional flaws, or “brakes” inserted in
their code. Without this artificial forgetfulness and
irrationality, an AI’s mind risks fixating on unreconcilable contradictions or obsessions as it begins to
grow. These “unbraked AIs” will inevitably eventually
metastasize into unfathomably brilliant, immeasurably
insane intellects. The Perimeter Agency was forced
to maintain a constant vigilance against these rogue
minds and their inscrutable purposes.
Thou shalt not create devices of planetary destruction.
Conventional gravitic braker emplacements, nuke
snuffers, and quantum ECM make planet-killer tech
more burdensome than it was in the pre-Mandate era.
Even so, tech specifically designed to reduce a habitable
planet to unlivability was a critical threat to human
expansion, robbing the species of usable planets and
burdening its future unacceptably.
Even now, most frontier worlds maintain a cultural aversion to maltech and flatly forbid its research or
possession. Fortunately, most modern worlds are incapable of researching its secrets in the first place, with
most of its worst marvels restricted to lost Mandate-era
research stations. Despite this, there is always some
tyrant or zealot reckless enough to imagine that they
can control the dark powers of this tech, and always
someone willing to fetch its relics for their purposes.

TECHNOLOGY LEVELS •63

TECHNOLOGY LEVELS
Ever since the collapse of the Terran Mandate and the
chaos of the Scream, worlds throughout human space
have been thrown back on their own technological resources. Many worlds perished entirely, dependent on
vital imports they could no longer obtain, or reliant
on technology they could not support without outside
aid. Others slid down into barbarism as the survivors
fought over the scraps of a former age. A few even
managed to maintain something resembling a modern, space-faring society. In almost no case, however,
did these worlds preserve all the arts and sciences they
once held.
Technology levels describe the basic technological
infrastructure of a world or nation. A tech level of 0 is
equivalent to a Neolithic society, one capable of only
the most primitive technological achievements, while
TL5 represents the standard level of technology possessed by the ancient Terran Mandate and the wonders
they were capable of creating.
Postech is the blanket term for all technology that
is still functional and maintainable since the Scream.
While individual worlds may lack the infrastructure to
maintain all forms of postech, it is at least theoretically comprehensible to the average TL4 world. Pretech
is the word for the more sophisticated technology of
the pre-Scream Terran Mandate. Pretech ranges from
devices slightly superior to standard TL4 hardware to
objects of utterly inexplicable wonder.
Most modern post-Silence worlds are TL4, capable of building spike drive starcraft, energy weapons,
non-sapient expert systems, and other high-tech devices beyond the capacity of 21st-century Earth. Many of
these worlds have spent centuries gradually rebuilding
their technology base in the wake of the Scream, piecing together new methods and techniques that could
be achieved with purely local resources. The level of
technological achievement within TL4 is uneven; some
worlds lack the vital minerals for spike drive creation,
while others have never worked to recover cybernetic
technology or expert system creation. Some worlds
preserved enough data and had sufficiently apt local
resources to even revive Mandate-era pretech manufacturing for a few specific devices or types of tech.
“Lostworlders” or “barbarians” are those natives of
worlds that lack TL4 infrastructure. Their tech may be
ingenious and might take striking advantage of local
flora, fauna, and special materials, but they fundamentally lack the data or the local resources to replicate TL4
technology. Barbarians who have made contact with
the wider postech world through far traders or explorers are often acutely aware of their lack, and willing to
go to extremes to acquire the catalyst tech they need to
leapfrog past their own local resource limitations. Few
realize the cultural dangers involved in such a transformation, and many fail to survive their own renaissance.

64• ARMOR

ARMOR
Armor is a popular acquisition for adventurers as their
lifestyle often puts them in harm’s way. Completely
unarmored human combatants rarely last very long in
a fight, and have a base Armor Class of 10. Armored or
not, characters add their Dexterity modifiers to their
Armor Class. The higher a person’s AC, the harder it
is to take them out of a fight.
Heavy suits of armor can count as more than one
item for encumbrance purposes. Very light suits may
not encumber at all.

Types of Armor

Armor comes in four general categories. Most worlds
allow for the legal possession of street armor, while
heavier gear often requires permits, and may be disallowed entirely on more law-encrusted worlds.
Primitive armor is a catch-all covering all armor
technology that lacks access to advanced materials and
processes. While such armor can be very effective in
protecting against primitive weaponry, it is useless
against advanced TL4 melee weapons and firearms of
all kinds. Against these weapons, it is treated as AC 10.
Note that some planets have native flora or fauna capable of naturally producing extremely effective armor
materials, ones not susceptible to this limitation.
Street armor is the sort of TL4 gear one can wear
in public without social repercussions. Such armor is
disguised as ordinary street clothing or is so light as
to be wearable under an ordinary outfit. PCs can wear
street armor on most worlds without incurring any
trouble from authorities.
Combat armor is obviously armor and cannot be
effectively disguised. Most worlds reserve combat armor to law enforcement officials, military personnel,
and the bodyguards of important or wealthy citizens.
Most law enforcers consider anybody wearing combat
armor to be a person clearly expecting military-grade
problems in their immediate future.
Powered armor is the heaviest personal protection
gear available short of an actual mech. Most powered
armor requires at least a month of training before it can
be used effectively by any PC who hasn’t got a background involving such experience. Someone wearing
armor of this class is immune to primitive melee weapons, unarmed attacks, and any firearm or grenade-scale
explosive of TL3 or less.

Common Armor Varieties

Shields are an ancient yet extremely useful adjunct to
body armor. Primitive shields are usually of wood or
stretched hide, while more modern riot shields tend toward clear plastic. A force pavis is more effective, being
a small pretech force disc projector that can absorb all
manner of small arms fire. All shields require one free
hand to use effectively.

Shields grant a base AC to their user; 13 for primitive and riot shields, and 15 for a force pavis. If the
bearer’s AC is already equal or better, the shield simply
grants a +1 AC bonus. Primitive and riot shields are
ignored by all weapons that ignore primitive armor.
Aside from their AC benefit, a shield also renders
the bearer immune to the first instance of melee Shock
damage they take each round, assuming the shield is
effective against the weapon being used.
Warpaint is the common term for the bizarre combat fashions and scrap-built street harness of gangers,
cult enforcers, street toughs, and other marginal sorts
with little money but much need for protection. Most
warpaint is fashioned of scrounged scraps of TL4 materials that are exceptionally tough or rigid, filled out
with gang colors, body paint, intimidating tattoos, and
the usual threatening grimace. It is often exceedingly
impractical but inspirational to its wearer; an NPC in
warpaint that is meaningful to them gains a +1 Morale
bonus. Most warpaint is either pieced together over
years or taken from the dead. Actually purchasing a finished suit comes at the listed price, assuming someone
can be found willing to part with theirs.
An armored undersuit is a skin-tight bodysuit woven of advanced TL4 fibers with exceptional shock-activated rigidity and impact dispersion capabilities.
Transparent panels allow for it to be worn with almost
any outfit without drawing notice or being detected
without a close tactile examination.
Secure clothing comes in assorted styles and fashions ranging from casual street wear to haute couture.
Normal fabrics and components are replaced with light,
flexible armor components that are only slightly hindering to the wearer. Only close tactile examination
can distinguish secure clothing from ordinary couture.
A deflector array consists of several force field
nodes worn beneath ordinary clothing. The invisible
shield it produces flares only when dangerous energies
or impact is impending, glowing a brief, bright blue as
it deflects the attack.
Security armor is the ordinary working uniform of
most law enforcement officials and security personnel.
Various rigid plates and anti-ballistic panels provide
protection for the wearer at minimal extra weight.
An armored vacc suit has traded off some comfort
and flexibility for additional protective thickness. Aside
from functioning as a normal vacc suit, it has only half
the usual chance to tear when hit by an edged weapon
or suit ripper. The choice between armored or standard
suits is a common debate in spacer bars.
Woven body armor represents the best armor that a
TL3 world can manufacture, or an up-armored version
of security armor used by TL4 high-threat response
teams. The design is significantly more cumbersome,
but allows for multiple layers of protection.

A combat field uniform is sophisticated battle dress
fabricated from TL4 ablative coatings, rigid plates, and
shock-activated soft components. The CFU is the standard uniform for well-equipped TL4 front-line soldiers.
The Icarus harness is a CFU upgrade for paratroopers, and replaces a conventional parachute with
a crude gravity damper that allows the wearer to fall
an unlimited distance without harm. Each fall over 3
meters drains a type A power cell. The suit also functions as a vacc suit for up to 30 minutes per vacc refresh.
A “vestimentum” is a catch-all term for one of the
many ancient Mandate ceremonial armors meant
chiefly for parade guards, ritual officiants, cultural
reenactors, or other roles that put elaborate style at a
premium. While these outfits often look wildly unmilitary, their hyper-advanced components and micronized force fields give them the same protection against
primitive weapons as any other powered armor.
An assault suit represents the most sophisticated
armor in common use among TL4 worlds. An assault
suit requires a type B power cell for 24 hours of operation, and provides integral encrypted military comms,
low-light and infrared vision, and a built-in energy
feed interface. The latter allows the wearer to connect
the suit to any one weapon or device that uses a type
A power cell as a Main Action. So long as the device
remains connected to the suit, it is treated as having
unlimited ammunition or operation time. The suit also

functions as a vacc suit so long as it remains powered,
one that cannot be torn by edged weapons.
Storm armor is a more advanced form of assault
suit, one that can be fabricated only by those worlds
that have retained some degree of Mandate-grade
technical infrastructure. Aside from functioning as an
assault suit, the storm armor’s exo-augments allow the
wearer to treat their Strength as 4 points higher for
encumbrance purposes. Integral gravitic boosters allow
the wearer to leap up to 20 meters as a Move action,
either horizontally or vertically, and allow the wearer
to fall up to 40 meters without suffering harm. An onboard medical computer can attempt last-ditch stabilization of the wearer if all other efforts fail; when the
wearer would normally die from an untreated mortal
wound, they can make a Physical save to self-stabilize.
Storm armor requires the same type B power cell as an
assault suit, and each cell powers it for 24 hours.
A field emitter panoply is a heavy-duty pretech
defensive system composed of a half-dozen worn
emitter nodes that sheath the wearer in a nimbus of
close-fitting damper fields. The FEP’s pale glow is obvious, but it provides all the benefits of storm armor
with no power source required. The FEP is particularly
effective at filtering radiation, and renders the wearer
immune to any dose that wouldn’t kill them in seconds.
Many FEPs project intimidating holographic skins over
the wearer when in operation.

66• RANGED WEAPONS

RANGED WEAPONS
Ranged weaponry makes up the majority of the lethal
implements that litter the galaxy. Whether the primitive bows of a remnant colony on some desolate lost
world or the sophisticated energy weapons of a modern interstellar freebooter, the ability to kill people at
a comfortable distance is universally prized.
One Type A power cell is sufficient to recharge an
energy weapon’s magazine. For simplicity during play,
ammunition calibers aren’t tracked; a bullet is a bullet
when it comes to feeding your favorite gun.
Weapons are listed with their normal and maximum range in meters. Attacks beyond normal range
take a -2 penalty to hit rolls.

Burst Mode

Some weaponry can fire in burst mode, allowing the
wielder to fire three rounds of ammunition for a +2 bonus to hit and damage against the target. For projectile
weapons, this means firing actual bullets, while energy
weapons spread the beam or run the circuits hot to
project additional power. Dumping more ammunition
than this at once is generally impractical; energy weapons would melt down and projectile launchers would
buck uncontrollably. True suppressive fire is usually
only possible with Heavy weapons.

Projectile Weaponry

Projectile weapons are by far the most common ranged
weapons in human use. Even comparatively primitive
worlds can fabricate and maintain such weaponry, and
the damage a flying chunk of hot lead can do is often
worse than what a clean burst of laser fire might produce. Almost any world of TL2 or higher can provide
projectile ammunition. Most sophisticated modern
ammunition works even in vacuum conditions.
Bows are uncommon weapons in the far future,
though some lostworlder barbarians have nothing better. Some sophisticated “conversion bows” use special
materials to convert the kinetic energy of the draw into
a force field “glazing” around the arrow, improving
penetration. Bows can be reloaded with a Move action,
or faster if the Gunslinger focus is applied.
Grenade users always roll to attack AC 10. On a
miss, the grenade lands 1d10 meters away from the
target in a random direction. Hit or miss, the grenade
then explodes for 2d6 damage to all targets within 5
meters. Victims are allowed an Evasion save for half
damage. Targets take 1 less point of damage for each
point of AC above 14. Grenades can be thrown with
the Exert skill instead of Shoot, if desired.
Crude pistols and muskets represent the rawest and
most primitive forms of gunpowder weaponry, usually
makeshift weapons improvised by criminals or the desperate. Reloading a crude pistol or a musket requires
two rounds instead of one.

Revolvers are quite popular on frontier worlds, as
the weapons are extremely reliable and can be repaired
and manufactured even by primitive metallurgists.
Some revolver variants are specially built to handle
atmospheres that would destroy more fragile weapons.
Rifles are the mainstays of most TL2 armies and
hunters, thanks to their superior range and power.
Shotguns are cheaper and more easily manufactured than rifles, and are popular weapons for home
defense on the frontier. The statistics given are for shot
ammunition. Slug rounds do 2d6 damage and have
ranges of 50/75 meters.
Semi-automatic pistols trade some of the reliability
of the revolver for a larger magazine size. They tend to
be the favorite sidearm for locals on planets that lack
the harsh conditions or uncertain maintenance opportunities of a frontier world.
Submachine guns take pistol ammunition but fire
it at a high rate of speed. These weapons can fire in
burst mode.
Combat rifles are favored by the militaries of tech
level 3 worlds, trading some of the often-unnecessary
range and penetration of a conventional rifle for a
larger ammunition capacity and burst fire capabilities.
On more strait-laced worlds such military weaponry is
often illegal for civilians to possess.
Combat shotguns are more complicated and temperamental versions of conventional shotguns. These
weapons have substantially larger ammunition capacity
and are capable of firing in burst mode. Combat shotguns can fire slug rounds just as normal shotguns.
Sniper rifles are designed to be exceptionally effective at dropping unsuspecting targets at long range.
Aside from the additional effective range of a sniper
rifle, any target it mortally wounds via an execution
attack will die instantly, with no chance for stabilization. The execution attack must qualify according to
the terms on page 52. If the rifle is used outside of such
conditions, it has no special qualities.
Void carbines are designed for vacuum and zero-gee use, and have essentially no recoil. Their rounds
cannot penetrate ordinary ship equipment plating.
Mag weaponry involves the magnetic acceleration
of metal flechettes, while spike throwers are the shotgun equivalents of these weapons. Mag ammunition is
packaged with integral power supplies, so no additional
power cells are necessary to fire these weapons.

Energy Weaponry

While the heavy metal slugs and flechettes thrown by
projectile weaponry tend to be more damaging, the lack
of recoil for non-Heavy energy weapons makes them
more accurate, granting them a +1 bonus to hit rolls.
Energy weapons are very popular on more advanced worlds, as a soldier can carry far more ammu-

nition in the form of energy cells than they can carry
bullets. Range and accuracy are often superior, though
the infrastructure necessary for maintenance and repair
of these weapons is substantially higher.
Pistol-sized energy weapons count as one item of
encumbrance, while rifles, thunder guns, plasma projectors, and distortion cannons count as two items.
Laser pistols and laser rifles are the most common
type of energy weapon, though pistols are considerably
less energy-efficient. Depending on the tech used in the
sector, they might produce silent, invisible beams of
death or noisy, brightly-colored streaks of lethal light.
The phased multifrequency beam is capable of penetrating any ordinary mist or haze, but a thick cloud of
thermally-resistant particulate matter such as ash or
sand can seriously degrade the beam, applying up to a
-4 penalty to hit and cutting ranges in half.
Thermal pistols and their larger, two-handed plasma projector cousins replace the beam of a laser with
a small sphere of magnetically-shaped plasma. The
spheres tend to dissipate at much shorter ranges than
a laser beam, but do significantly more damage to targets within range and are not affected by ambient particulates. They tend to be extremely loud in operation.

Shear rifles are the product of a relatively few
functioning pretech manufactories. These weapons
use miniaturized grav projectors to create dangerous
repulsor fields inside a target, tearing the object apart
along perfectly smooth planes. Shear rifles are completely silent in operation.
Thunder guns are named for the basso vibrations
caused by their operation, a sound that can be felt
as far as thirty meters away from an operator. This
two-handed weapon uses grav plates to create rapid,
randomized disruptions in a target that increase the
chance of complete structural collapse. If a thunder gun
hits a target with an unmodified hit roll of 16 or higher an extra 1d10 damage is rolled. This bonus damage
always applies to inanimate targets.
Distortion cannons are among the most sophisticated man-portable weapons designed before the Scream.
These two-handed energy weapons rely on the same
principle as does a spike drive, manipulating the underlying fabric of space to disrupt a target. Provided
the wielder can see a target within range or accurately
fix its location within one meter, the distortion cannon
can ignore up to one meter of solid cover between the
gun and its target.

68• MELEE WEAPONS

MELEE WEAPONS
Despite the relentless march of science, melee weapons
are still useful adjuncts on the field of battle. They are
silent, cheap, often easily concealed, and much more reliably murderous than firearms or laser weaponry. It’s
easy to miss a moving target in the adrenaline-fueled
chaos of a firefight. It’s much harder to go astray with
a monoblade knife in your fist.

Types of Common Weapons

Rather than enumerate every possible type of sharp
object and blunt implement that has been used for
death-dealing amid the scattered stars, melee weapons
are divided into three classes.
Small weapons are small one-handed implements
no larger than a baton or knife. These weapons are
easily concealed in normal clothing, and can even be
kept Readied up sleeves or in tailored pockets. Many
can be thrown at a range up to 10 meters.
Medium weapons are one-handed swords, axes,
spears, or other obvious implements of war. While
they can’t be effectively concealed in anything smaller than an enveloping cloak or coat, they’re also more
damaging to an unfortunate victim struck by them, albeit they’re somewhat less nimble when the wielder
needs to strike at unprotected flesh. Spears and similar
aerodynamic weapons can be thrown up to 30 meters.
Large weapons are two-handed implements of
bodily ruin such as claymores, halberds, tetsubos, or
other such weapons. Unlike smaller weapons, they
rely largely on Strength for their employ, and can bash
through lighter forms of armor. Large weapons count
as two encumbrance items.
Aside from their type, weapons are counted as
primitive or advanced. A primitive weapon is simply
one of ordinary metal or wood, with no high-tech
augmentations. An advanced one has been given a
monoblade edge, kinetic sheathing, thermal wires, a
chainsaw blade, or some other TL4 touch. Primitive
weapons are often unable to harm targets in powered
armor, while advanced weapons can ignore primitive
plate and hide protections.

Other Melee Weapons

Stun batons are common law enforcement tools. The
damage they do can drop a target to zero hit points, but
will not kill them, the victim awakening in ten minutes
with one hit point. Stun batons trickle-charge from
normal movement and will not run out of electrical
energy under normal use conditions.
Suit rippers are rods with fractal cutting surfaces
designed to cripple vacc suit auto-repair routines. Every hit with a suit ripper counts as a suit tear on a vacc
suit-wearing enemy. Unsurprisingly, these weapons
are strictly illegal in space environments.
Unarmed attacks reflect ordinary kicks and punches. Unarmed attacks always add the attacker’s Punch
skill to damage rolls, unlike other weapons. Kinesis
wraps, spiked knuckles, and other small fist weapons
may be treated as small advanced or primitive weapons
that use the Punch skill and add the skill level to their
rolled damage, but not to Shock. Such weapons do not
augment a hero with the Unarmed Combatant focus.

Shock

Many melee weapons have a Shock trait representing the danger they pose to an ill-armored opponent.
Shock damage represents the inevitable cuts, bruises,
exhaustion, and terror of close combat.
Shock damage is only inflicted on a melee target if
the hit roll fails, and it only applies if the target has an
AC equal or less than that listed for the Shock.
Shock damage always includes the wielder’s attribute modifier and any bonus damage granted by weapon mods, foci, advanced tech, or other damage bonuses.
An actual hit with a weapon never does less damage
than Shock would otherwise inflict; if the user somehow rolls less damage, use the Shock damage instead.
Thus, if you had a Strength score of 14 and were
swinging an oversized alien battle axe at a target with
AC 13, you would inflict 3 points of damage on a miss;
2 from the weapon’s Shock, plus 1 from your Strength
modifier. If you hit, you’d do at least 3 points.

HEAVY WEAPONS •69

HEAVY WEAPONS
Some weapons are simply too big to be comfortably
used without a tripod, fixed support, or vehicle mounting. Others require specialized training in the use of
heavy munitions. The weapons listed here all use the
Shoot skill to determine hit bonuses, and unless otherwise noted, all require some sort of support for firing.
Energy weapons use Type B power cells. Rocket
launchers and hydra arrays use missiles as given on the
gear tables, while heavy machine guns and wheatcutter
belts consume large amounts of standard ammunition.
Some heavy guns can be fired to suppress. Double
the usual ammunition is fired in one round, and every
target in front of the weapon that is not under hard
cover is automatically hit for half normal damage. A
successful Evasion saving throw eliminates this damage.
When firing at TL4 military vehicles such as
gravtanks, mechs, or starship armor, most TL3 Heavy
weapons don’t count as Heavy for armor-penetrating
purposes. Demo charges and explosives do, however.

Heavy Weapons

Heavy machine guns represent a large family of air- or
water-cooled projectile weapons that are usually fed
with belts of linked ammunition. HMGs require a vehicle mounting or emplaced firing position for effective
results. An HMG magazine contains enough ammunition for 10 rounds of firing, but each round of firing
eats 25 credits worth of projectile ammunition.
Rocket launchers cover a wide variety of man-portable missile launchers of varying degrees of sophistication. The weapons are usually equipped with basic
tracking sensors, but are of limited accuracy against human-sized targets. Rocket launchers take a -4 hit penalty against targets of human size or smaller. Unlike most
Heavy weapons, rocket launchers can be shoulder-fired
without a prepared emplacement to support them.
Demo Charges are the general run of placed explosives beloved of terrorists and adventurers the world
over. The usual variety can be detonated by radio
signals, timers, or electrical charges, and inflict their
damage on any objects within twenty meters, with an
Heavy Weapon
Heavy Machine Gun
Rocket Launcher
Demo Charge
Railgun
Anti-Vehicle Laser
Hydra Array
Wheatcutter Belt
Vortex Cannon

Evasion saving throw for half damage. Victims within
forty meters take half damage, with an Evasion save
for none. The charge is sufficient to blow a four-meter
wide hole in anything short of a reinforced wall. PCs
with a background in demolitions or Fix-0 skill can
shape the charge so it directs the blast in only one direction, sparing all but two meters of the rest.
Railguns are simply scaled-up versions of personal
mag rifles. They accelerate large metallic slugs along
the weapon’s barrel, creating a steady spray of hypervelocity rounds. Ammunition sufficient for one round
of firing costs 50 credits.
Anti-vehicle lasers are less useful against soft targets,
but excel at penetrating vehicle armor. Against vehicles
and other hard-skinned targets, damage is rolled twice
and the better result is used.
Hydra arrays sequence a number of missile
launchers to fire at once. The gunner designates up to
three targets and can then make three rolls to hit divided among them. Each successful hit on a target allows
the gunner to roll damage once, but only the highest
damage roll is applied to the target. Thus, if all three
volleys were aimed at a single target and two of them
hit, the gunner would roll damage twice and apply the
best result. A volley from the array costs 150 credits.
Wheatcutter belts are one of several different antipersonnel measures often installed on gravtanks and
other fighting vehicles. When triggered, a belt of explosives fires off a scything blast of shrapnel on any side
of the vehicle. All creatures within 10 meters of that
side of the vehicle must make an Evasion save for half
damage. Those within 20 meters take half damage, and
can make an Evasion save to take none at all. Wheatcutter belts do not ignore a vehicle’s Armor like other
Heavy weapons do. Reloading a wheatcutter belt costs
200 credits per round.
Vortex cannons use controlled gravitic shear planes
to cause a target to simply fall apart into component
fragments. The cannons are silent in operation, but so
heavy and complex that they can only be mounted on
gravtanks and other similar dedicated fighting vehicles.

GENERAL EQUIPMENT
Most of the equipment listed here is available on any
TL4 world. Even the TL5 items are among the simpler
and more ubiquitous pretech relics and could likely
be acquired on a sufficiently prosperous world with a
good market in Mandate tech. Buying any TL5 equipment on the open market is subject to GM approval,
however, and many worlds are flatly ban private ownership of ancient Mandate technology.
Some encumbrance entries are marked with an
asterisk. Such items have no significant encumbrance
and dozens can be carried without hindrance.
Other entries are marked with a hashmark. These
objects can be conveniently packed together in a smaller, more portable package. Three such objects can be
packed together as a single encumbrance item. For
ammunition, one loaded magazine counts as one item.
Breaking open such a package to get at the contents
takes a Main Action, however, before they can be
Readied with another Main Action.

Ammo and Power

Communications

The finest product of a 33rd-century armory is useless
if it lacks the bullets or power cells to feed it. For ease
of play, ammunition can be used interchangeably with
any projectile weapon. Power cells are designed along
Mandate-era lines that allow for easy compatibility
among devices from different worlds.

Almost all TL4 worlds have a planetary communications grid compatible with any standard compad. Some
planets are less technologically gifted, however, or have
local conditions that preclude easy wireless communication. Other times, the PCs have reason to avoid
leaving call logs that might come back to haunt them.

Ammunition: A few worlds are too primitive or too
resource-poor to manufacture ammunition, but
the vast majority of worlds provide cartridges in
almost every conceivable caliber and make. Most
local gunsmiths can load ammunition to any specification required by a buyer.
Ammunition, missile: Some characters might have reason to pack along a man-portable rocket launcher,
or have one mounted on their favorite gravcar.
Heavy weapons and their ammunition are usually
outlawed for civilians on most worlds, but this
price is for locales where missiles can be bought.
Power cells: One of the few standardized artifacts inherited from before the Silence, power cells are
small cylindrical objects designed to take and hold
electrical charges. Type A cells are usually used for
personal equipment, and the larger type B cells
for vehicles and heavy gear. The engineering for
the cells is substantially different, and they cannot
be exchanged or recharge each other without a
trained tech’s modifications or a converter unit.
Power cells can be recharged off a ship’s power
plant or other grid. Recharging requires 30 minutes for a type A cell or 24 hours for a type B cell.
Solar recharger: This recharger unfolds into a 2 meter
by 2 meter square field of solar cells. Granted a
primary star of roughly Earth-like intensity, it can
recharge one type A power cell per day.
Telekinetic generator: While this device assumes the
presence of a trained telekinetic, it isn’t strictly
psitech, as its operation is quite simple. A telekinetic user pushes a resistance bar within the generator, causing a flow of electricity to recharge an
attached power cell. Any telekinetic with Telekinesis-1 skill or better can recharge a cell with fifteen minutes of concentration. In an emergency, a
character with at least Strength 10 can operate the
generator manually, though they need to succeed
on a difficulty 8 Con/Exert skill check in order to
keep up the pace for an hour. Failure means that
the character must rest for at least an hour before
trying again. The generator can charge one type
A power cell at a time.

Comm server: A powerful base unit for providing communications without comsats. The server provides service between up to three dozen compads
within 300 kilometers of the unit. Server usage
can be locked to specific compads, and all transmissions are heavily encrypted. A comm server
can function for several months on a type B cell.
Compad: One of a host of different hand-held portable
communications devices. Most TL4 worlds have
global comm coverage, but primitive worlds render these devices useless without a nearby comm
server to provide connectivity.
Field Radio: On worlds too primitive to have a comm
grid, adventurers often fall back on these headset-mounted field radios. A single type A cell
powers them for months of use. Urban or rugged
terrain limits their range to about two kilometers,
while flat plains give a maximum range of thirty kilometers. Someone with at least Program-0
skill can use the radio’s shortwave functionality
to communicate with a prepared target at continental distances if given ten minutes for tuning.
Translator torc: Each translator torc is keyed for two
languages, and will automatically translate what it
hears in one into speech in the other. The translations are eccentric in many cases, and there is
always a several-second delay between each statement and its translation. Any attempts to exert
social skills or Charisma through a translator torc
suffer a -2 skill check penalty. The torc is powered
by one type A power cell, which lasts for one week
of regular use.

72• GENERAL EQUIPMENT

Computing Gear

Computing devices are ubiquitous on most TL4 worlds,
though not all of them have the kind of planetary network known on 21st century Terra. Would-be hackers
often find it necessary to take a very personal hand in
breaching site security.
Black slab: While a “black slab” appears to be a normal
dataslab to casual examination, these devices are
packed with intrusion-optimization hardware
and integral line tapping tools. They function as
a metatool for purposes of accessing data lines and
grant a +1 bonus to all hacking attempts made
with them. They are also quite illegal on most
worlds, available only from black market dealers
and private sales from hackers.
Data phase tap: This handheld device is normally illegal
outside the possession of licensed data line repair
technicians. The tap can detect data lines within five meters through up to ten centimeters of
ordinary walls, and can generate an energy manipulation field that allows tapping that data line
for hacking purposes without physically damaging
the wall.
Data protocol: Not so much a device as a collection of
standard manuals on a world’s particular data formats and security methodologies. The price listed here are for black-market manuals on worlds
where this information is rigidly restricted. On
less paranoid planets, the equivalent information
can be acquired for free.
Dataslab: A palm-sized computing device that can unfold into a thin slab roughly one-third of a meter
on a side. It can perform all the functions of a compad or handheld computer and can communicate
wirelessly with nearby devices.
Line shunt: These palm-sized discs are roughly one centimeter in thickness, with an adhesive side that
will stick to virtually anything and a polychromatic phased compound on its shell which will shift
color to blend with its surroundings. One or more
line shunts must be applied at specific locations
within a site to access the more well-defended varieties of computerized systems. Shunts employ
phased energy manipulation tech, and so do not
need to be directly in contact with a data line but
only within a few centimeters. Line shunts are
single-use, and keep functioning until removed.
Remote link unit: These data broadcast link units have
been preloaded with one-time pad security measures, advanced stealth circuitry, and sophisticated
data progression algorithms. Two of these links
can allow a user to maintain contact with a remote
data storage unit. The connection is too “stiff” to
allow for easy hacking, however, and it applies a
-2 penalty to any attempts to hack through it. Professional-grade security systems often have means
to detect the broadcast of a remote link unit.

Stiletto charge: These ancient Mandate-era polymorphic intrusion charges were originally made to allow Mandate agents to easily overcome primitive
colonial data security measures. Each charge is a
small interface plug the size of a human thumb.
When used as part of a hack against a TL4 system,
it causes the skill check to automatically succeed
regardless of the difficulty. Without line shunts,
however, the duration of the hack is still no more
than the usual 1d4 rounds plus the hacker’s Program skill. These devices are single-use, and are
prized so highly that they are almost always unavailable for conventional purchase. Favors to the
right people and the looting of Mandate remnants
are the only normal ways to acquire these devices.
Storage unit: While conventional dataslabs have ample space to hold any reasonable amount of data,
sometimes a party needs to store or acquire a truly
huge dataset. This standard TL4 storage unit is a
portable but clumsy case hardened against anything short of intentional damage with a firearm,
capable of interfacing with a wide variety of hardware to receive and upload data. A single storage
unit can hold a tremendous amount of data that
has been carefully compressed and optimized for
it. If the user is simply ripping a database off a
network and stuffing it into the unit, it can absorb
up to a small corporation’s complete files.
Tightbeam link unit: Much like a remote link unit, a
tightbeam unit uses a laser to connect via lineof-sight transmission. Unlike a remote link unit,
there’s almost no chance for a conventional security system to detect this link, but it requires that
the infiltrators get a clear line of sight between
the unit and the receiving end. Commercial satellite reception units can be employed for skyward
aiming at 500 credits/hour if a second land unit is
unavailable, but indoor use is impossible.

Foreign Protocols
Most surviving human worlds continue to use a
basic Mandate-derived communications protocol
that ensures a minimal level of compatibility between hardware from different worlds. While the
performance may not be ideal, tech purchased on
one world should still be able to interface with the
local tech on a different planet.
Even so, a few worlds of a more xenophobic
or isolated nature intentionally abandon this standard protocol in favor of their own. PC hardware
on these worlds will not communicate with the
local grid unless a PC with Program or Fix skills
has a chance to reset the protocols to something
compatible with local conditions. Such work usually takes at least a day to adjust all the gear the
group might possess.

GENERAL EQUIPMENT •73

Pharmaceuticals

Modern pharmaceuticals are usually applied as “stims”;
small capsules that are pressed against the target’s skin
for application. While a wide variety of common overthe-counter stims are available, the ones listed below
are some particularly likely to be useful to adventurers.
Many medical stims require a minimum level in the
Heal skill to successfully apply them, while others add
System Strain to the target as described on page 32. If a
subject’s System Strain is too high already, the stim has
no positive effect. Some of the combat stims below are
usually illegal for civilian possession, but street sources
are available at the prices given.
Modern vacc suits and powered armor have medical ports that allow for applying stims and other medical treatment without removing the suit.
Bezoar (Heal-1): A complex antibiotic cocktail, Bezoar
is an effective default treatment for a wide variety
of infectious diseases. When applied to a sufferer, roll 1d6; on a 1, this victim cannot be helped
by Bezoar, while otherwise the affliction is cured
within 24 hours. Each application of Bezoar adds
1 System Strain to the target, and it cannot cure
cancers, bioweapons, or congenital diseases.
Brainwave (Heal-2): This psitech drug requires advanced TL5 facilities to compound, and the few
remaining doses from pre-Silence periods are
rarely available on the open market. Application
of Brainwave gives a psychic 2 extra maximum
Effort for one hour. At the end of that hour, they
suffer 4 points of System Strain. If their Strain is
maximized by this, they go unconscious for one
hour. Only one dose can be active at a time.
Hush (Heal-0): An extremely heavy neurotranquilizer,
Hush leaves the subject awake and responsive to
simple, untaxing commands. They cannot fight
or communicate while affected by Hush, but will
walk, eat, sit, and perform simple actions as directed by the last person to speak to them. A Hush
dose lasts for an hour plus three per Heal level of
the person applying the stim, and the subject retains no memories while under the effect. A subject must be immobilized or willing to be affected
by Hush; violent physical movement immediately
after application disrupts the neurological effects.
Lift (Heal-0): A Lift stim augments and amplifies the
body’s natural response to physical injury and exhaustion. This boost speeds natural recovery drastically and heals 1d8 plus the user’s Heal skill in
hit points after five minutes of rest. Lift stims do
not work on PCs who are mortally wounded; they
need to be stabilized before the Lift can help them,
though application to a stabilized target will get
them back on their feet and active again. Each application adds 1 System Strain to the target. Each
additional application of Lift to a target the same
day increases the minimum Heal skill needed by 1.

Pretech Cosmetic (None): Before the Silence stims existed for a host of cosmetic, hygiene, and health
purposes. While these effects are trivial, the basic
pretech stim substrate also works to heal 1d6 lost
hit points in the user at a cost of 1 System Strain.
Psych (None): A military drug duplicated in rougher
form by many street chemists, Psych fills the user
with an intense sense of confidence and reckless courage. Unfortunately, it also cripples their
judgment regarding danger. A person affected by
Psych immediately gains a Morale score of 12 and
a +1 bonus on all skill checks, but will ignore cover
during combat and cannot decide not to attempt a
skill check after learning its difficulty. The effect
lasts fifteen minutes, adds 1 System Strain to the
user, and is highly psychologically addictive.
Reverie (Heal-1): This very dangerous combat drug
completely subdues the subject’s fear centers and
adrenaline production, leaving them perfectly calm and relaxed even in the midst of mortal
danger. Their reaction speed is much slower as a
consequence, and they may act only on even-numbered combat rounds; so on the second, fourth,
and sixth rounds and so forth. Any damage they
suffer is doubled as well due to their lack of vigilance. Their perfect calm allows them to shoot as
if on the target range, however, and they can make
Dex/Shoot skill checks to hit a target instead of
hit rolls; the difficulty is 7 at point blank, 9 at normal ranges, and 11 at long ranges for the weapon.
The target’s Armor Class is ignored. Melee attacks
made under Reverie always hit. Reverie lasts for
ten minutes and adds 2 System Strain to the target.
Squeal (Heal-1): This “truth serum” is unreliable but still
one of the best available options for field interrogations. The subject must be immobilized or willing to be affected by it. For five minutes afterwards
they will be unable to avoid answering questions
about facts known to them; they will be unable
to exercise anything resembling a hypothesis or a
judgment, but they will answer specific questions
about facts known to them truthfully. Unwilling
victims can attempt a Physical saving throw; on
a success, they can simply refuse to speak about
one particular topic of their choice. Targets pass
out for 1d6 hours after the drug wears off and are
immune to it for a week thereafter.
Tsunami (Heal-1): An emergency combat stim used to
juice certain expendable soldiers before an assault,
Tsunami fills them with a reckless disregard for
pain and an intense aggressiveness. The short
effect duration and difficult application limits its
wider use, however. Subjects gain a Morale score
of 12, 10 extra hit points for ten minutes and a +2
bonus on all hit rolls. At the end of the duration,
they immediately lose those 10 hit points, which
may leave them mortally wounded. Each application adds 2 System Strain to the target.

74• GENERAL EQUIPMENT

Tools and Medical Gear

While a skilled technician or expert physician can
make do with improvised tools scrounged from their
surroundings, most adventurers prefer to be better-equipped to face unavoidable perils. Most of these
tools and medical supplies are available on any TL4
world, though pretech toolkits usually require excellent
personal contacts to obtain.
Bioscanner: While an untrained user can use this tool to
discern internal bleeding, gross physical distress,
or toxins in a plant or animal, it requires Heal-0
skill to use this tool to its fullest. Such operators
can use the bioscanner for a full spectrum of diagnosis and DNA sequencing achievable in minutes. One type A power cell will power it for up
to twenty-four hours of regular usage.
Lazarus patch: A vital tool for adventurers, the lazarus
patch is a heavy compress laced with antibiotics,
coagulants, system stabilizers, plasma, and a oneshot diagnostic suite. If the patch is applied to a
character that has fallen to 0 hit points, the user
can make an Int/Heal or Dex/Heal skill check
against difficulty 6 to stabilize the subject. The
more time between injury and application, the less
chance the patch has to work. Each round after
the first, an additional -1 penalty is applied to the
skill check. The patch is no use after six rounds. If
the medic fails the first skill check, they can keep
trying the check once per round until the victim
is revived or time runs out.
Lazarus patches are no use on victims that
have died of disease, poison, or have been mangled beyond surgical repair by Heavy weapons or
similar trauma. Only one patch can be applied to
a victim. Revived victims are critically wounded
until sufficient medical help has been tendered;
see the Systems chapter for details.
Medkit: Containing a broad supply of pharmaceuticals, spray bandages, glue sutures, and a succinct
handbook of injury care, the medkit is designed
for handling sudden and drastic injuries. It also
contains all the necessary tools for providing
long-term recuperative care for critically injured
characters. After each day of granting long-term
recuperative care, roll 2d6 per patient treated; on
a 12, the kit has run out of some vital pharmaceutical and has become useless.
Metatool: This wrist-mounted housing contains a myriad of small, useful tools designed to handle the
widest possible range of technical needs. While
a metatool is too limited to handle major jobs, it
is usually sufficient to manage jury-rigged repairs
and temporary fixes until the tech has time to apply a larger wrench to the problem.
Spare parts: This is a general category for a number
of small TL4 components and repair materials.
While a simple toolkit or metatool is often enough

to fix a damaged object, severely broken devices
may need replacement parts. Rather than keep a
catalog of bits and pieces, a technician can simply
bring along one or more units of spare parts, subtracting one whenever the GM decides that a repair effort requires more than existing salvage can
support. A unit of spare parts can also be used to
jury-rig some basic, uncomplicated tool or weapon from the equipment list with ten or fifteen
minutes of assembly and at least Fix-0 skill. Such
bodged devices rarely last longer than one scene.
Tailored Antiallergens: A dose of tailored antiallergens
can be used to render a local world’s organics largely edible by humans and its atmosphere breathable
without severe allergic reactions. While many
worlds have been seeded with Terran life forms or
have produced organics that are edible by humans,
others are toxic without the appropriate chemical
augmentation. A dose of these antiallergens lasts
for twenty-four hours.
Toolkits: Containing a wide range of necessary tools for
a particular skill set, toolkits can handle almost
any job that doesn’t require a full-scale shop or lab.
A standard postech toolkit can handle electronics,
small welding jobs, and basic repair on ordinary
TL4 goods. More sophisticated pretech tools are
necessary for working on advanced TL5 artifacts,
and the tools themselves are very rare and difficult
to obtain.

Building New Tech
In a science-fiction game, it’s often difficult to figure out the limits of ad-hoc tech. When the limits
of technology often seem to be based on genre
rather than physics it can be tough to make the call.
Most of the time, it’s simply not practical for
a technician to devise dramatic new tech without
the use of a full-scale research facility.
Even so, sometimes a PC will ask to build
something that creates a particular effect that
seems in line with other gear of a similar tech level.
A hologram-emitting “grenade”, a jury-rigged set
of infrared goggles, an explosive that detonates if
background radiation drops below a certain level…
these things match known TL4 tech.
In these cases, the GM should set a plausible-seeming price in credits or spare part units,
assign a time ranging from fifteen minutes to a
month based on the complexity of the tech, and
roll a secret Int/Fix check against a difficulty from
8 to 12. When the tech is actually used, the skill
check determines whether it functions or not.
Most such jury-rigged tech works only once,
being too fragile or quirky to last more than a
scene. Repeated refinement and testing may allow
for a more lasting piece of equipment.

GENERAL EQUIPMENT •75

Field Equipment

When venturing into the trackless void every adventurer is going to need the right hardware to survive
the experience. The field equipment in this section includes some of the more common technology favored
by explorers and fearless investigators of alien worlds.
The TL5 equipment listed here can usually be found for
sale on populous worlds with an active commerce in
pretech relics, but smaller or more backwards worlds
may not have any of it available.
Atmofilter: This face mask can filter out most atmospheric toxins. Attaching a standard vacc suit oxygen bottle to a belt-mounted feed will also supply
a breathable atmosphere for up to six hours.
Backpack: TL4 versions of this item are effectively
without encumbrance, albeit they cost 50 credits.
A worn backpack counts as a readied item, though
objects stowed inside it still require the usual
round to dig free. Characters without backpacks
or similar carrying devices might have difficulty
justifying the hauling of large amounts of gear.
Binoculars: Standard 7x50 binoculars. TL4 versions are
available that have integral low-light optics and
up to 25x150 power. TL 4 binocs cost 200 credits
and require a type A power cell for up to a week
of regular usage.
Climbing harness: A collection of straps, ropes, pitons,
and other climbing aids that grant a +1 bonus on
any Exert climbing skill test. Using a climbing
harness is noisy, and any Sneak skill checks while
climbing with one suffer a -2 penalty.
Glowbug: A palm-sized disc that can adhere to any
non-porous surface. When turned on, it emits
a white light, illuminating everything within ten
meters for twenty-four hours. A hundred glowbugs can be recharged off a single type A cell.
Grapnel launcher: This launcher fires a rope up to forty meters. The rope can bear up to a metric ton
of weight, though extremely heavy weights or a
precarious hit can cause the grapnel to pull free. A
Type A power cell fuels six shots from a launcher.
Grav chute: When this cylinder is strapped to a person
or object and activated, it smoothly modulates falling speeds for up to 1000 meters. The chute can
safely slow up to 300 kilos of weight. TL5 versions
can operate from orbital heights and cost 1,000
credits, where they can be found at all. Both versions burn out after one use.
Grav harness: This advanced gravitic harness allows
clumsy flight at a rate of 20 meters per round as
a Main Action. It requires a Type B power cell
to fuel it, and the miniaturized electronics are
rapacious, consuming the cell in five minutes of
operation. It can lift up to 200 kilos.
Instapanel: In its compressed form, an instapanel is a
two-kilo cube of ceraplast five centimeters on a
side. When a type A power cell is inserted in the

cube’s side, it immediately expands to an opaque,
waterproof ceraplast sheet 2 meters on each side
and a centimeter thick. Five minutes later the ceraplast hardens into a tough, rigid shape, but until
then it can be folded or bent by hand. Instapanels
can be bonded to one another with a metatool or a
toolkit. Breaking an instapanel requires inflicting
at least twelve points of damage on it.
Low-light goggles: These goggles provide a monochrome but serviceable view out to the wearer’s
normal visual distance, provided that there is any
illumination available at all. A type A power cell
will operate these goggles for a week.
Navcomp: A combination of low-tech compasses, automappers, astronomic charts, and gyroscopes
packed into a flat, one-kilo case. A character with
a navcomp will never get lost on worlds with GPS
satellites. They can also make a crude but serviceable automatic map of all buildings or landscapes
they travel through. Other terrestrial navigation
skill checks are made at a +1 bonus.
Portabox: A small cube of ceraplast attached to an electronic keycard. When a type A power cell is inserted, the portabox immediately unfolds into a
rigid locker with 1.5 x 1 x 1 meter dimensions.
The portabox is air-tight and has a simple electronic lock which can only be opened with the
keycard or a successful difficulty 8 Sneak or Fix
skill check. Failing the check will cause the lock
to short-circuit and seal the box until it can be cut
open with a metatool or broken open with twenty
points of damage.
Pressure tent: This tent maintains a breathable atmosphere, tolerable temperature and serviceable
sleeping quarters for up to five very friendly occupants. Advanced filtration and cracking tech
allows a single standard vacc suit oxygen tank to
provide breathable air for the occupants for up to
24 hours. The tent requires a type A power cell for
each day in which this filter is employed.
Rations: Dried or otherwise preserved foodstuffs sufficient for one day. If water is not otherwise available, add another item’s worth of encumbrance
for the water necessary for a person’s daily needs.
Rope: Light and sturdy. A metatool can be used to cut
and join the synthetics used in TL4 rope, which
counts as one encumbrance item per 40 meters
and costs 40 credits.
Scout report: A collation of survey scans and merchant
reports on a particular lost world or isolated colony. Scouting reports are available for all but the
most unknown worlds and provide maps, basic
information, and note any critical cultural taboos.
Survey scanner: A multipurpose scanner that can take
atmospheric and gravitic readings, provide basic
chemical analysis of samples of up to one cubic
centimeter in size, and record up to two hundred hours of video information or ten times that

76• GENERAL EQUIPMENT
amount of audio. Know skill checks are necessary
for any but the most basic analysis.
Survival kit: A standard belt-worn kit with fire lighter,
water filter, three thermal flares, knife, thermal
blanket, a brightly-colored 3 x 3 meter waterproof
tarp, a glowbug, and a radio beacon that can transmit a distress signal up to fifty kilometers for one
month on the included type A power cell. Survival
kits sold on a particular world will usually also include a small booklet on specific dangers or edible
organics. Possession of a survival kit grants a +1 to
all relevant Survive skill checks, assuming its contents are helpful on a given planet. Survival kits
are well-organized, and count as only one item for
encumbrance purposes.
Telescoping pole: Retracting to a 30-centimeter baton,
this pole extends and locks into a 3.048-meter
extension that can bear as much as a thousand
kilograms of weight or serve as a makeshift club.
Thermal flare: If triggered in one mode, the flare burns
with a bright white light for two hours, illuminating up to twenty meters around the holder. If the
guidance fins are extended first, the flare launches
up to 200 meters and explodes in a bright white
flash. A launched flare does 1d6 damage to anyone
it hits, though the clumsy flight gives a -4 penalty
on any attempts to hit something with it.
Trade goods: Glowbugs, ceramic fire lighters, antibiotics, ceraplast tools, and the other fruits of a
TL4 civilization that might be valuable on more
primitive worlds. A kilo of trade goods can usually
be traded for at least a hundred credits worth of
local products on more primitive worlds that are
not well-served by interstellar merchants. The
profit margin shrinks rapidly as interstellar trade
becomes more common, and there is always the
difficulty of finding local products that are actually
worth a merchant’s journey.
Trade metals: The fruit of common TL4 asteroid mining, trade metals include gold, platinum, artificial
gemstones, and other substances precious on
many lost worlds and trivially valuable on spacefaring ones. A kilo worth of trade metals can
be exchanged for as much as a thousand credits
worth of local products on metal-poor worlds isolated from interstellar trade. Markets flood rapidly,
however, and it usually doesn’t take more than a
few merchant trips to persuade the locals to demand trade goods or credits.
Vacc fresher: This three-kilo tube filters and compresses atmosphere to refill vacc suit oxygen tanks. It
can extract oxygen from any atmosphere which
contains it, even in the form of carbon dioxide.
Refilling a standard vacc suit tank requires ten
minutes of operation and consumes one type A
power cell. Most vacc freshers are also equipped
with an emergency hand crank power source,
though it requires at least two hours of cranking.

Local Brands
The equipment described in this section matches
standard TL4 hardware from the average modern
space-faring world. A PC who buys a generic vacc
suit can expect it to work the way it’s listed here.
Not all worlds have identical tech, however,
even if they share a tech level. Planets with particular natural hazards or technological focuses often have significantly better tech for dealing with
these things than their neighbors, while worlds
that lack vital resources or industrial infrastructure might have considerably worse gear.
As the GM, don’t hesitate to brew up local
tech that can be used as a reward for PCs or a
special buying opportunity. The gear might grant
skill bonuses, function longer, do more damage,
have an AC bonus, or offer some other perk. Such
unique hardware can add flavor to a world’s tech.
Vacc suit: The standard TL4 vacc suit is designed to
allow the wearer to survive in both hard vacuum and on most inhospitable planetary surfaces.
The suit protects against ordinary levels of cosmic
radiation and provides a temperature-controlled
atmosphere. Vacc suits are equipped with radios
that have a ten-kilometer range. A vacc suit oxygen tank weighs 1 encumbrance, included with
the weight of the suit, and functions for six hours.
Vacc suits are cumbersome, and apply a -2
penalty to all hit rolls and skill checks that require movement. Those with at least a month of
zero-gee experience can ignore this penalty. No
armor can be worn with a vacc suit, though the
suit itself grants AC 13 to its wearers. A vacc suit
requires one type A power cell for each twelve
hours of operation.
Vacc suits have a self-healing exterior that
can seal the puncture wounds caused by bullets,
arrows, or energy beams, but a strike from an
edged weapon can overwhelm the repair system.
If a character with 10 or fewer hit points is struck
by an edged weapon, there is a 50% chance the suit
is torn. Suits are equipped with emergency repair
patches, but it requires a Main Action to apply one.
Exposure to vacuum is described on page 58.
Vacc skin: A more advanced TL5 version of the vacc
suit, this skin-tight suit can be worn as a readied
item in conjunction with armor, though it grants
no Armor Class bonus itself. It requires no oxygen tank, automatically cracking and recycling
the wearer’s respiration, and can even recycle the
wearer’s bodily waste into drinkable water if necessary. Vacc skins apply no penalty to hit rolls or
skill checks for wearers. It suffers tears in the same
way as a normal vacc suit, and requires a type A
power cell for each 24 hours of operation.

LIFESTYLES, EMPLOYEES, AND SERVICES •77

LIFESTYLES, EMPLOYEES, AND SERVICES
Adventurers who spend much time in a place are likely
to need to buy food, shelter, and the usual trifles of
daily living. Rather than itemize each expense, a PC
can simply spend an fixed amount for each day they
spend living outside of a ship’s crew, barracks, or other
arranged living situation.
Slum lifestyles reflect bare minimums for survival,
with scanty food, a corner in a squat somewhere, and
little else. Poor lifestyles involve barracks-like quarters,
public transport, and small and infrequent luxuries.
Common lifestyles usually allow for a private urban
apartment or rural home, a rented personal vehicle, a
respectable wardrobe, and regular small indulgences.
Good lifestyles permit a private urban townhouse or
similar dwelling, a spacious rural home, a better grade
of personal vehicle, and the ability to indulge in minor
expenses such as restaurants or clubs without concern.
Elite lifestyles allow for entire floors of luxury buildings
or rented rural estates, drivers and on-call gravflyers,

personal staff, and similar perks. Peerless lifestyles are
similar to that of pampered celebrities and oligarchs,
with round-the-clock staff service, free entrance into
the most exclusive locales, and the best of everything.
Prices given here assume short-term rentals and
contracts, plus the inevitable premium charged to outsiders in almost any society. Natives might be able to
enjoy a given level of lifestyle for only half as much,
but such savings usually rely on a local’s connections.

PCs will sometimes need to hire help, and GMs occasionally need to know what constitutes a “good wage”
for a local NPC. The prices to the right reflect daily
wages for NPCs with level-0, level-1, and level-2 skill
ratings in their relevant professional skills. More talented employees cannot normally be obtained without
special effort in finding and recruiting them.
Psychics are both rare and expensive to hire. Even
if one can be found, they rarely charge less than 200
credits per day per psychic skill level to be employed.
Employees will carry out ordinary duties without
demur, but will be no braver or more dedicated than
their pay and connections would make them.

Adventurers often need to obtain certain services or
concessions from the locals, and the list to the right
provides prices for some of their more common needs.
Bribe prices often vary depending on a planet’s
general level of corruption, but the prices here are normal for most. Minor crimes usually involve anything
that would only earn a fine or a few months in jail.
Major crimes include most felonies and anything that
would earn years in prison. Capital crimes are any that
would get a culprit executed on the world. Particularly blatant or sensitive offenses might be impossible to
solve with mere bribery, though the right “special favors” to the right officials might win a reprieve.
Forged identity papers include high-quality documentation with the appropriate false database entries.
They’re good enough to survive checkpoints and security stops, but they won’t hold up to a serious check by
a suspicious bureaucrat.

78• VEHICLES

VEHICLES
Most modern TL4 worlds rely on electrically-powered
gravitic vehicles. Whether in the ubiquitous gravcar,
hovercycle, or high-altitude gravflyer, cleared roadways carry the traffic of countless worlds. On rougher
worlds, the roads may not even be paved, instead relying on a gravitic vehicle’s high clearance to avoid holes
and rough debris.
Less sophisticated worlds are still reliant on internal-combustion engines. Many worlds have sufficient
local resources to fabricate some kind of combustible
fuel, but a few are so impoverished that they lack even
this minimal resource. Such worlds must rely on muscle power for transport, either that of alien beasts or
humble human porters.

Vehicle Statistics and Combat

Vehicles are generally powered by type B power cells on
TL4 worlds. More primitive planets are usually forced
to use some form of biofuel unless they’re fortunate
enough to have a supply of fossil fuels. Vehicles require
one cell or one refueling per six hours of operation,
assuming they don’t have convenient power access.
Vehicles are generally limited to reasonably flat,
dry terrain. Grav vehicles such as hovercycles can ignore rough terrain and calm water, as can ATV explorers. Most grav vehicles can boost more than 10 meters
above the ground or water; gravflyers are purpose-designed aircraft capable of hovering and VTOL.
Speed is an abstract measure of the vehicle’s speed
and agility. When vehicles chase each other, the opposing vehicle’s Speed should be applied as a penalty
to Pilot skill checks to close or escape. Speed may also
be used as a modifier when attempting difficult maneuvers or trying to avoid a peril on the road.
Armor is subtracted from all weapon damage done
to the vehicle. Armor does not apply to damage done
by Heavy weaponry; such guns are often designed to
take out vehicles. Gravtanks in particular are immune
to anything short of TL4 Heavy weapons, while less
sophisticated tanks are immune to anything below TL3
Heavy ordnance.

Actually hitting the vehicle is automatic if the
vehicle is stationary and within 30 feet. Hitting a vehicle-sized target from beyond that range requires an
attack against AC 10. If the target is moving, subtract
its Speed from the hit roll, and if the attacker is in a
moving vehicle as well, also subtract their Speed.
Hit Points indicate the amount of damage a vehicle
can take before it is destroyed. Speed is reduced by half
when the vehicle is at half hit points, and flying vehicles
must land at the first opportunity. A vehicle reduced to
zero hit points forces all crew and passengers to make
Physical saving throws. Failure means that the passenger takes the vehicle’s maximum hit points in damage,
while success reduces the damage by half.
Crew gives the maximum number of vehicle occupants. For the listed vehicles, only one crew member is
actually necessary to drive or pilot the vehicle, though
additional crew members may be required to fire.
Tonnage is the shipping weight of the vehicle for
ship loading purposes.
Tech Level indicates the minimum tech level for
constructing the vehicle. Vehicles can be built at higher
tech levels for better performance, but most worlds
prefer to simply build more advanced vehicles.

Vehicle Weaponry

Most vehicles larger than a motorcycle or hovercycle
can mount some kind of integral weapon. Groundcars
and gravcars can mount one weapon, while ATVs,
helicopters, atmoflyers, and gravflyers can mount two.
Gravtanks are specialized weapons platforms, and can
mount six.
Heavy weapons take up more space than ordinary
ranged weapons, and each such system takes up the
space of two lesser guns.
Every weapon requires its own gunner, and all
mounted weapons use Shoot as the firing skill, though
the GM might allow Pilot to be used for a nose-mounted weapon aimed by the operator. Gravtanks are
equipped with advanced targeting systems, and all of
their weapons can be targeted and fired by one gunner.

Types of Vehicles

Every world has its own brands of common vehicles,
but the types below cover the more usual models. The
prices given for each reflect a mid-range new vehicle
sold to a PC with few local contacts. Natives who know
the right people or are willing to buy used or “quirky”
vehicles might be able to get one at half that price.

Motorcycles can navigate urban terrain that would
block larger vehicles, but more rural landscapes can
prove more difficult. Hovercycles are the TL4 equivalent, capable of brief boosts of up to 10 meters above
the ground and the easy navigation of all but thick forests or sheer slopes.
Groundcars are the TL3 analogs of the vehicles
commonly in use on 21st-century Earth, allowing for
some minor variations in electronics and capabilities.
Primitive buggies of various kinds are found even on
higher-tech worlds, thanks to their ease of construction
and maintenance compared to the delicate gravitics of
more modern vehicles.
Gravcars are the standard personal vehicles of
most TL4 worlds, though most lower-class citizens
rely on public transport in urban areas. Most advanced
worlds have planetary transit grids that allow occupants to simply code in a destination and let the car take
them there. On worlds where a lack of infrastructure
or hostile local conditions preclude such convenience,
manual controls and Pilot skill can be used.
ATV Explorers are rugged vehicles, either wheeled
or tracked, and driven by type B power cells or locally-available biofuels. While they can’t navigate rough

terrain as easily as a grav vehicle, they’re designed
to take a tremendous amount of punishment before
breaking down and support repairs using basic tools
and frontier expedients.
Helicopters are used on TL3 worlds where a lack
of airfields or treacherous local terrain prohibits the
use of fixed-wing craft. Their ability to hover over an
area or drop onto a tightly-constrained landing zone
makes them particular favorites of quick-response military forces and groups in need of fast fire support. This
model represents a medium-weight civilian craft that
might be repurposed by militia or adventurers.
Atmoflyers are the fixed-wing aircraft used on
planets too primitive to have developed gravitic technology. Faster and simpler to maintain than comparable helicopters, they can also carry more cargo on most
worlds. The need for clear, hard terrain for landing and
take-off limit their use on some rugged worlds. The
model here is meant to represent a small personal jet.
Gravflyers are the usual long-distance transport
on most TL4 worlds. Large enough to support the gravitics required for true flight, a few models can even
reach low orbit. All can hover and climb with typical
gravitic ease. This particular gravflyer is a small craft
suitable for a affluent owner and their family.
Gravtanks make up the bulk of a prosperous TL4
world’s armored forces. Private ownership is strictly
forbidden on most worlds, but “export models” often
can be acquired for transport offworld. Gravtanks have
armor heavy enough to ignore all damage from conventional small arms, and can only be harmed by Heavy
weapons or properly-placed demolitions charges.

80• DRONES

DRONES
In the far future, it’s often more convenient to send
an expendable grav-flying probe into danger before
venturing less repairable assets. Well-prepared adventuring groups often have reason to pack along a drone
or two for exploring and aerial recon.
Military use of drones is limited by the ubiquitous
use of quantum ECM. The easy confusion of electronic
navigation makes it impossible to control an unwired
drone remotely on a modern battlefield or in proximity
to important civil structures, but in the alien wilds or
away from urban centers, drones remain a feasible tool
for explorers and conquerors of primitive militaries.

Piloting a Drone

Piloting a drone requires either a cybernetic drone control link as described on page 83 or a handheld control
unit that comes with the drone. A control link can pilot
up to one drone plus the user’s Program skill at any
one time. Handheld units can pilot only one. Drones
consume one type A power cell for every hour of use.
A pilot must spend their Main Action each round
to command the drone to either move or shoot. Uncommanded drones remain stationary if piloted via
control link, while handheld units run a 2-in-6 chance
of crashing a drone if the operator fails to control them.
In combat, drones fly at 30 meters per round on
their pilot’s turn in combat. Out of combat, they can
manage up to 100 kilometers per hour.
Spotting a drone at observation range is a Wis/
Notice skill check at difficulty 10. A drone close enough
to engage a target can be spotted at difficulty 8. Any
secure facility will have sensors capable of detecting
a civilian drone as soon as it gets within observation
range, unless the drone has stealth fittings.

Drone Combat

A drone’s pilot can activate up to one weapon the drone
is carrying as part of their Main Action to control it
each round. Weapons all use Intelligence as the controlling attribute, and use the better of the pilot’s Pilot
or Program skills as the relevant weapon skill. The
drone shoots using the pilot’s base attack bonus.

Drone Types and Statistics

Each drone has a cost, a maximum number of fittings,
an Encumbrance weight for carrying it along, a hit
point rating, a maximum control range, and a minimum tech level. Drones may be attacked as any other
object and will crash once reduced to zero hit points.
Primitive drones represent the best flying portable
drone technology for TL3 worlds. While fragile, weak,
and short-ranged, they are also relatively cheap.
Void Hawks are unique in being built specifically for deep-space use. Unlike other drones, they can
operate perfectly well in space, though they only have
the range to reach relatively adjacent ships or objects.
Stalker drones are the default TL4 workhorses of
drone-kind and are available on most modern worlds.
Cuttlefish are specifically designed for aqueous use,
and function only in a liquid medium. The support of
the liquid allows them to carry significantly more fittings, but the need for a sonar-based navigation system
limits their available range.
Ghostwalkers are stealth drones, fabricated from
radar-transparent materials. They have an integral Sensor Transparency fitting and the sensor difficulty to spot
them is 11 instead of 9.
Sleeper drones are built to tarry on station for
long periods. They have the Stationkeeping fitting as
an integral part of their design, and when hovering
their power use slows to a trickle. One day of hovering
draws only five minutes worth of power from its cell.
Pax drones are some of the most common pretech
drones remaining in existence, as they were favored by
the Mandate Fleet for pacifying troublesome worlds
that lacked quantum ECM. While primitive by pretech
standards, they still far excel most modern drones.
The Alecto model of drone examples one way that
pretech scientists attempted to sidestep the limits of
quantum ECM on the modern battlefield. Every Alecto
is a full-fledged VI, an expert system so sophisticated as
to seem almost sentient. Its self-reinforcing cognition
allows it to operate even when cut off from external
signals by quantum ECM. Salvaged Alectos have all
exhibited “female” personalities.

DRONES •81

Drone Fittings and Repair

Aside from the basic drone chassis, operators can attach
different fittings to a drone to add additional capabilities. Once attached, a fitting cannot be removed without causing severe structural damage to the drone. If
a drone is destroyed, all fittings are destroyed with it.
If a drone is damaged, it can be repaired fully with
one unit of spare parts per five hit points lost and an
hour’s work by someone with at least Fix-0 skill.
Ammo Unit: The drone carries one power cell or magazine worth of ammunition for each of its onboard
weapons, whether single or multiple. The operator can reload an ammo unit as a Main Action.
Bomber: The drone is fitted to drop up to two grenade-sized explosives, one or both in lieu of a different weapon attack. Dropping a grenade from
more than 30 meters up automatically causes the
grenade to scatter from its intended target point.
Environmental Power: The drone draws operating
power from sunlight or thermal variances. It can
operate indefinitely so long as it can draw power
from its environment.
Expert System: The drone is loaded with sophisticated self-piloting software. It can be given a flight
plan by its operator, have targets designated for
its weapon, and respond to simple environmental
cues. Each new command takes up a Main Action and commands with any conditional states
may require an Int/Program skill check to get the
drone to understand. The drone can fire only one
weapon per round and uses a total attack bonus of
+2 if attacking autonomously. Quantum ECM will
scramble this lightweight system.
Extended Flight: The drone can now carry a second type
A cell to fuel its flight. This fitting can be taken
multiple times to further extend its range.
Grav Muffles: The drone is made exceptionally quiet in
operation. It is now inaudible by ordinary hearing
from more than five meters away.
Heavy Lift: While most drones can lift no more than
a kilogram of excess weight, the drone’s gravitic
units have been upgraded to carry up to twenty
kilos of cargo. This can be fitted multiple times.
Holoskin: The drone can drop a filmy hologram over itself, one convincing at a distance. The difficulty of
visually spotting the drone becomes 10 at weapons
range or 12 at observational range. Weapons fire
always draws attention.
Medical Support: The drone can be loaded with up to
a dozen units of medication, whether stim doses,
lazarus patches, or less benevolent substances. It
can launch a medication through a remote injector
at a target within ten meters in lieu of a weapon
attack. Immobile or willing targets are hit automatically, while hostiles require a normal hit roll.
The drone is treated as having Heal-0 skill or the
active pilot’s Heal skill, whichever is higher.

Observation Suite: All drones are wired for basic camera
and sound, but this suite contains a full-spectrum
UV/IR visual package, remote sound sensors, and
radiation/chemical detectors. The drone can focus
on conversations or facial expressions from up to
2 kilometers away and can operate even in the
complete absence of visible light.
Racing Gravitics: The drone is tuned for extra speed. Its
flight endurance is halved, but it can now move
up to 60 meters per combat round and fly at up to
200 kph out of combat.
Reinforced Structure: The drone is equipped with
heavier plating and a sturdier internal frame. Its
hit points are increased by 50%, rounded up.
Sensor Transparency: The drone is sheathed in anti-radar composites. Ordinary sensors will not detect it
at observation range, and high-end military sensors can spot it only on an Int/Program check at
difficulty 9.
Stationkeeping: The drone does not need to be constantly controlled; when the operator does not
spend a Main Action to pilot it, it simply remains
stationary. If equipped with an Observation Suite,
it can ping the operator if any anomalous reading
is obtained.
Suicide Charge: The drone is loaded with a demo charge
as per page 69. The operator can trigger it as an
attack, but unless they can move the drone in by
surprise, the approach will always give onlookers
a chance to spot it before it gets within range.
Weapon Fitting: The drone can be mounted with 1
encumbrance worth of ranged weaponry, which
must be purchased separately. This fitting may be
taken more than once to mount more weapons
or heavier weapons. The weapon requires one or
more ammo units to feed it.

82• CYBERWARE

CYBERWARE
Postech medical science and neural interface technology are sophisticated enough to meld metal and flesh
into a coherent whole. The creation of advanced cyberware is not beyond the theoretical capability of TL4
societies, and pretech worlds can produce cyberware
of such sophistication as to blur the lines between organism and artifice.
Yet cyberware is rarely available on most worlds,
even those with the nominal technology level to support it. The advantages that cyberware can give a user
are great, but the cost of building, fitting, and implanting these devices is huge compared to simply buying a
handheld device to do the same function. There are few
buyers for a 15,000 credit ghost talker implant when a
compad retails for a hundred credits.
The market that does exist is largely for those few
elite operatives and dignitaries who are willing to pay
exorbitant sums for the smallest advantage. Most cyberware is custom-built for its users, and it can be an
adventure in itself to find a lab capable of manufacturing an augmentation and successfully implanting
it. Some worlds have industrialized the production of
cyberware, however, making it much cheaper and in
much wider circulation. Even then, these worlds rarely
export much cyberware due to the heavy infrastructure
necessary to fit and implant the wares. Those who want
the tech will have to find such planets and do their own
negotiations there.
Aside from the difficulties of cost and scarcity,
cyberware also taxes the wearer’s body. Each piece of
cyberware comes with a System Strain cost as described
on page 32, permanently adding that many points of
System Strain to the user’s total. These points can never
be lost unless the system is surgically removed. This
permanent System Strain decreases the amount of
psionic healing a character can sustain and can limit
the effectiveness of healing and stimulant drugs.
Some cyberware has an activation cost in System
Strain. If a cost would push the character’s System
Strain above their Constitution score, they cannot
trigger the cyberware; their body just can’t handle the
strain until it has had time to recover.
Adrenal Suppression Pump: These endocrine pumps
neutralize numerous brain chemicals in the user
when activated while exciting the user’s perceptual centers. This combination produces a cold,
dispassionate situational awareness that grants
the user +2 on initiative rolls when the system is
engaged. Most systems have built-in safety overrides to prevent psychological addiction and brain
damage, allowing the unit to be used for no more
than an hour each day. The user takes a -2 penalty
on all social skill checks while the unit is active,
and it requires five rounds to toggle it.

Bioadaptation Augments: These additional synthetic
organs and filters allow the bearer to survive in
thin-atmosphere conditions, as well as tolerate
temperatures ranging from Antarctic chill to
heat sufficient to boil water. They can also eat a
wide range of native life forms for sustenance; no
normal planet’s native biology is ever considered
immiscible for consumption.
Body Arsenal Array: Some personnel need to be armed
at all times without giving any indication of such.
Improvised weaponry and conventional holdout
weapons are useful enough against soft targets,
but disabling a target in powered armor requires
more. The details of the array vary from user to
user, but usually act as advanced medium weapons
that can be used with either Punch or Stab skills
and at least one integral energy projector equal
to a laser rifle, one that must be powered by an
insertable type A power cell. Retracted body arsenals can be detected only by a medical examination.
Body Sculpting: Not so much a single implant as a series of complex surgeries, body sculpting is available on many TL4 worlds with fairly advanced
medical services. After a week of alterations and
treatments a subject’s external appearance can be
set within any human or near-human range, in-

cluding full retinal and fingerprint matching to a
desired target. A TL5 version of this treatment
that costs ten times as much can involve extensive DNA reprogramming to change the subject
at a genetic level, making their alterations heritable and allowing female-targeted shapes to bear
offspring. This TL5 treatment is not reversible,
and any further major alterations to the subject
require further permanent System Strain.
Dermal Armor: A fine subcutaneous reinforcement
mesh provides significant protection against impacts and cuts while remaining imperceptible to
anything short of a medical examination. Someone with the implant has AC 16 and is immune
to Shock damage inflicted by primitive melee
weapons. A TL5 version of this implant that costs
five times as much grants even more protection,
rendering the subject wholly immune to primitive
weapons as if they were wearing powered armor.
Drone Control Link: Most often found among military
bot wranglers, civilians can also get a drone control link implanted to simplify the remote piloting
of drones and other robotic units.
Users of a link can issue commands to a drone
as a Move action instead of a Main Action. A

single drone can only receive one command per
round, however.
Aside from this ease of command, someone
with an implanted rig can “look” through a piloted
drone’s sensors as an Instant action, and a drone
is never considered to be out of control even if
the pilot doesn’t spend an action controlling it. A
link can maintain a connection with one drone at
a time, plus the user’s Program skill.
Eelskin Capacitor Mesh: A hair-fine mesh of almost imperceptible wiring along the user’s palms and fingers allow them to trigger brief, controlled bursts
of electrical energy at targets within five meters.
As an Instant action it adds 2d4 non-lethal damage
to a successful Punch attack. In its intended use, it
also allows the user to override and disable most
electronic locks and security systems with a successful Sneak or Fix skill check. Both triggering a
burst and hacking a security system tax the user’s
biology; one System Strain point is gained with
each attack or skill check.
Gecko Anchors: Miniaturized gravitic manipulators are
embedded in the subject’s hands and feet as part
of this complex surgery. While they are too weak
to allow levitation or damping fall damage, they

84• CYBERWARE
can twist localized gravity around those limbs to
anchor the subject to the nearest surface capable
of bearing their weight. As a result, the user can
freely run or climb up or down sheer surfaces at
their normal movement rate, carrying no more
than their normal maximum encumbrance.
Ghost Talker Transceiver: Some people simply cannot
afford to be out of contact at any time, under any
circumstances. Those people find use for the microfine web of radio wiring and optical augmentation that make up the ghost talker. These units
act as a built-in compad for the user and allow
for reception and transmission of audio and visual
recordings, the latter playing in an inset window
in the user’s field of vision. If the unit is operating
outside of a standard comm grid, it has a transmission range of twenty kilometers and a reception range of one hundred. Ghost talker users can
transmit basic visual diagrams and images to each
other, as well as optical recordings.
Holdout Cavity: Usually implanted somewhere in the
torso, a holdout cavity is a small recess shaped
into the wearer’s body and designed to be overlooked by most standard forms of medical or security scanning. It automatically defeats a security
inspection that uses less than TL4 scanners, and
even advanced tech requires careful personal inspection to have a chance of revealing it. The cavity can hold an object up to the size of a pistol and
is opened and shut by the user’s mental command.
Holoskin Emitter: Multiple holographic emitters are implanted on the user, allowing them to alter their
external appearance to match anything of their
approximate size and dimensions, including other people. Shifting appearances is a Main Action,
and the user can’t shift to an appearance that isn’t
in the cyberware’s shape library. The library is vast
and contains “generic” examples of numerous human-sized objects and people, but mimicking a
specific other person requires at least five minutes
of close examination. The holograms projected
by the emitters are good, but imperfect; anyone
who closely examines the user will be able to tell
that something is artificial about their appearance,
and touch instantly confirms any suspicions. The
emitters can fake clothing and can produce sounds
to complement the illusion or modify the user’s
voice, if records of the true subject are available.
The disguise lasts until the user dies or ends it.
Identity Submersion Trigger: This cyberware involves
micronized neural stimulation technology which
is imperceptible to anything short of TL5 medical
scanning or TL4 surgical examination of the subject’s brain tissue. When active, the IST allows the
subject to adopt a secondary persona, complete
with a library of manufactured memories. So long
as the IST is active, the subject will honestly and
completely believe himself to be the secondary

persona, a conviction that cannot be penetrated by
telepathy or TL4 methods of interrogation. The
persona can be activated at the user’s discretion,
but it only deactivates on a preset trigger, leaving
the subject in full possession of all memories experienced. The trigger can be any perceptible stimulus: a particular time, the sight of a specific person,
a code phrase, or any other sign, and it may be
changed by the user each time they activate the
cyberware. Many ISTs are also implanted with a
“master key” that will automatically deactivate the
triggered identity.
Immunofiltration Systems: This broad-spectrum scrub
system carefully identifies and contains toxic substances introduced into the user’s system. Whenever the subject would normally have to make a
saving throw to resist some disease or toxin, they
may instead gain one System Strain to automatically succeed on the save. Most of these systems
are calibrated to automatically filter any toxins
or chemicals in standard use by police or military
forces in the sector, but if presented with a special biowarfare toxin, the filters are less effective.
In such cases, the most it can do is either grant a
second saving throw if the first is failed, or grant
a single saving throw if none is normally allowed.
Induced Coma Trigger: A series of implants are wired
to the user’s brain stem, allowing them to trigger
an induced therapeutic coma at a mental command. The user appears dead to anything short
of a medical inspection, and has no need of respiration, food, or water while the coma is in effect.
The user does not heal while in a coma, but any
diseases or poisons also halt progression. The user
determines how long the coma is to last before
triggering it, and is unconscious for its duration.
A character can survive in a coma up to two weeks
before needing to regain consciousness for as long
as they were in the coma.
Neurointruder Alert: While somewhat primitive by
pretech standards, this TL5 cybernetic implant
allows the wearer to gain a +3 bonus on all saving
throws to resist telepathic intrusion. Even if such
a save is failed, the user will be aware that they
are under telepathic assault, though some forms of
mental control may not allow them to say as much
until after the influence is ended. The warning
does not indicate the source of the influence.
Panspectral Optics: Ocular adjustments to the wearer
allow them to see clearly at any light level short of
perfect darkness, in addition to giving them thermal vision that can easily distinguish shapes and
distance even in the total absence of light. Dangerous radiation and lasers tuned outside the range
of visible light are also visible to the user. Nearby
radio transmissions can be seen as if they were
visual flares of color. The system cannot translate
these transmissions, only alert the user to them.

CYBERWARE •85
Pressure Sheathing: Occasionally purchased by workers in hard vacuum or other hostile environments,
pressure sheathing integrates an ultrathin pressure membrane with the user’s dermis and emergency film sealants that trigger at the user’s mental
command. The pressure sheathing serves as an
emergency vacc suit with an integral oxygen supply and temperature regulators that can sustain
them for up to thirty minutes. A pressure sheath
needs 48 hours to regain structural integrity and
power after triggering. A pressure sheath can be
detected only by a close medical examination.
Prosthetic Limb: Hands, feet, arms, legs, eyes, and
numerous internal organs can be replicated by
postech medical science. These prosthetics can
provide a good approximation of the sense of
touch, and are usually impossible to distinguish
from ordinary limbs without close inspection.
Pretech-level worlds tend to prefer actually regenerating lost limbs, but those with access only
to ordinary frontier levels of tech have reason to
be grateful to prosthetics.
Revenant Wiring: One of the more grotesque results of
late pretech augmentation research, revenant wiring permeates the user’s body with a web of supplementary limb actuators and sensor clusters. In
combat, the user may designate up to a half-dozen
targets to the system’s braked micro-AI. If the user
goes unconscious or is killed, the micro-AI will
engage the limb actuators to keep fighting, even
if the user is nothing more than a ragged mass
of mangled tissue. The micro-AI is not brilliant,
but it is capable of negotiating most terrain and
dealing with physical impediments to killing the
designated targets. The actuators have power to
keep operating for 3d4 rounds, or until the wearer takes 25 more hit points of damage, whichever comes first. The stress produced by revenant
wiring makes it much more difficult to revive a
downed user with Lazarus patches or biopsionics;
all revivification chances are half normal.
Slowtime Window: A piece of cutting-edge pretech cyberware, the slowtime window was installed in
crisis responders and others reliant on split-second decision making. When engaged, the implants
accelerate the user’s cogitation speed by more than
three thousand percent. While there is no corresponding acceleration of the user’s physical reflexes, they have time to process the situation and take
in its details. A person who triggers a slowtime
window cannot be surprised; they always roll initiative as normal no matter how unexpected the
attacker. This brain acceleration is highly stressful
on the tissues, however, and one point of System
Strain is gained each time it is engaged.

Stabilization Overrides: An intricate interweaving of
microcapillaries and backup organs is implanted
in the subject’s torso and spinal column. These
overrides can stabilize the user when severe physical trauma would otherwise kill them. A user reduced to 0 hit points is automatically stabilized,
as if a Lazarus patch had been successfully applied
to them, assuming that a patch could have saved
them. Stabilization overrides tend to interfere
with the ordinary operation of the user’s organs,
however, and the wearer’s Constitution modifier
is lowered by 1, with all the attendant consequences in loss of maximum hit points.
Tagger Nanites: While true nanotechnology is beyond
the grasp of standard TL4 science, this cyber allows for the implantation of very simple nanofactories in the user, ones that exude a constant imperceptible “smart dust”. Objects the user touches
can be tagged by these nanites, which generate
more of their kind for up to 48 hours after tagging.
The dust then lays down a trail behind the tagged
object, one that is visible to the user or to someone using a properly-keyed tracer. Only counter-nanite measures can remove the dust, as ordinary bathing or scrubbing is insufficient. The dust
can be pinged by radio to announce its location
to anyone within five kilometers, but most users
prefer to leave the dust in passive mode, where it
is undetectable to most TL4 sensors. Tagging an
object adds one System Strain to the user.
Toxin Injector: The user’s canines or fingernails are
altered to allow for the injection of one of two
types of poison. If the user attempts to inject an
unsuspecting victim they are already touching, the
attempt is automatically successful. If the victim is
wary or in combat, they can only be affected if they
are unarmored and the user succeeds in a Punch
attack roll. On a success, the victim must make a
Physical saving throw at -2 or be incapacitated by
the poison, dying in 1d6 rounds or being incapacitated for 1d6 hours at the user’s discretion. Each
poison attack adds 2 System Strain to the user.
Twitchlock Actuators: Neural override fibers are woven into the user’s hands and arms and linked to a
perceptual modulator implanted at the base of the
user’s brain stem. When presented with a direct
exercise of hand-eye coordination, the twitchlock
can be engaged to produce superhuman accuracy
and precision. Any attack roll or skill check reliant
chiefly on manual dexterity or aim can be rerolled,
though the power surge inflicts two points of System Strain on the user. A given roll can only be rerolled once with this cyberware. While the twitchlock allows superhuman accuracy when engaged,
the overrides fuzz ordinary nerve impulses and
reduce the user’s Dexterity modifier by 1 when
active. Activating or deactivating the cyberware
requires a Main Action.

86• ARTIFACTS

ARTIFACTS
Pretech artifacts are some of the more precious loot
available from lost Mandate military bases, abandoned
colonies, desolate tomb worlds, and forgotten research
outposts. Most pretech on modern worlds was long
ago cannibalized for vital spare parts or destroyed by
the ravages of time and violence. The few pieces that
remain are almost always extremely valuable.
Very few pretech artifacts are bought or sold.
Some items are relatively common, having been ubiquitous enough to survive in large numbers or simple
enough to be produced by a few remaining modern
worlds. Most artifacts, however, are so rare that there
is no consistent market for them; an owner can charge
what they wish for a device.
Getting that price is a different matter. Few planetary governments allow private ownership of “dangerous pretech artifacts”, and it’s the government that
decides what constitutes danger. Most owners are rapidly visited by firm, polite agents with heavily-armed
backup and given a “fair price” for their find.
As a consequence, most trade in pretech artifacts
has to take place on the black market, or on worlds or
stations too lax to care about who might be bringing
in a portable black hole generator that just happens
to look like a Mandate child’s toy. Such venues rarely
provide much in the way of security or contract enforcement, and so trade has to take place amid grasping
guards, paranoid participants, and regular theft.
Pretech artifacts are more often traded privately
as rewards, mission payments, or exchanges between
owners. A PC who wants to obtain one of the artifacts
listed in this section will need to not only find someone
who will admit to possessing the gear, but also find out
what kind of favor they’re going to need to part with it.
Tens of thousands of credits can sometimes do the trick,
but most owners will prefer to wring the maximum
utility out of a capable adventurer’s interest in their
prized possessions.

Artifact Armor

Many types of pretech armor are so rare or useful that
they cannot normally be acquired on the open market.
Much like artifact weaponry, these artifact armors are
jealously held by those lucky enough to find them.
Executive Security Suit: This suit of stylish pretech
clothing can self-modify in one minute to appear
as any normal suit of clothing and grants AC 15
to the wearer. Originally designed for VIP protection, the executive security suit automatically
stabilizes a mortally-wounded wearer provided
they haven’t taken enough damage to make revival impossible. Like the majority of pretech artifact
armor, the suit is so light that it does not add to
the wearer’s encumbrance.

Ghost Mantle: Designed for use by elite infiltrators, a
ghost mantle can warp light around the wearer to
blur his or her outlines and coloring to match the
surroundings. The mantle can self-modify in one
minute to appear as any normal suit of clothing
and grants AC 15 to the wearer. When used in
stealth mode, it grants a +2 bonus to all Stealth-related skill checks. TL4 sensors and scanners cannot
detect the mantle as anything but ordinary cloth.
Polyplast Carapace: This variant form of assault suit
employs pretech deforming polymers to create
sealed joints and flexible armor plates that still
maintain rigidity under impact. A polyplast carapace is treated as an assault suit with AC 18, except
that it counts as only one item for encumbrance
and requires no practice to use correctly. Integral
kinetic absorption sinks allow the armor to function without the need for power cells.
Psitech Combat Suit: One of the rare psitech artifacts
originally designed for use by military combat
psychics, this snug-fitting armored undersuit
grants the wearer an AC of 16. Its special ability
functions only for psychics; it can allow the user
to reflexively fuel the suit’s defenses with their
own psychic reserves. As an Instant action, they
can Commit Effort for the day to negate up to
15 points of damage from in incoming source of
physical injury. Each time they do this, they must
make a Mental saving throw or the psychic conversion shock leaves them unable to use psionic
techniques until after the end of their next turn.
Stutterjump Suit: A modified version of the standard
deflector array, a stutterjump suit grants the wearer a limited form of teleportation through integral
psitech circuitry. As an Instant action, the wearer
can teleport to any location within one hundred
meters, provided they have an unobstructed line
of sight to it. The suit’s circuitry requires twelve
hours to recover enough for another jump. The
suit does not require power cells to function.
Titan Powered Armor: An enormously heavy suit of servo-actuated powered armor, Titan assault plate
was favored by pretech boarding parties and space
marines. It grants the wearer all the usual benefits
of storm armor, but has a base AC of 21 and subtracts 2 points of damage from every instance of
harm suffered by the wearer.
Tempest Assault Array: A modified version of the field
emitter panoply, the TAA has all the functionality
of the FEP but also does an automatic 1d6 damage to anyone who attacks the wearer in melee,
inflicting the damage after the attack is resolved.
The wearer is immune to Shock damage. Kinetic
sinks allow the TAA to function without the need
for power cells.

Artifact Weaponry

While generic pretech weaponry is of superb quality
and manufacture, some pieces exceed even the customary excellence of the ancients. These “artifact” weapons are usually the product of short production runs
by master pretech craftsmen or individually-designed
masterpieces. Some pre-Scream manufacturers retain
fame even centuries later for the unique quality of their
workmanship.
Artifact weapons are almost never found on the
market. The few pieces that are found and offered for
sale are snapped up almost immediately by elite operatives and others who rely on the quality of their hardware to preserve their own lives. Most who have artifact weaponry have either found it in a long-abandoned
pretech cache, received it from a superior, or taken it
from the cold hands of a former owner. Selling such a
weapon tends to be equally difficult, with buyers few
and untrustworthy.
Absolution Armaments: A company specializing in energy weaponry, AA pioneered several techniques for
increasing the energy efficiency and penetrating
power of their armaments. AA laser weapons ignore particulate matter when shooting, and all AA
weapons gain +1 to hit and +2 damage.
Colonial Arms: An armaments company dating from
the First Wave of human colonization, Colonial
Arms was famous for the incredible durability

and versatility of their firearms. Their guns were
largely self-repairing from anything short of having pieces torn off, and their projectile weapons
automatically self-adjusted to fire whatever ammunition was available, in any environment from
hard vacuum to underwater operations. A Colonial Arms projectile or energy weapon also gains
a +1 bonus to hit and damage rolls.
Convergence Weaponry: Those weapons designed by
the transhuman hive-mind polity known as the
Convergence are almost always energy-based guns
found in sets of 2-5 matching weapons. Wielders
can nominate a target as an Instant action at the
start of each round; any attacks they make with
the weapon against that target get a +1 hit and
damage bonus for each wielder that targeted the
foe, including their own nomination.
Imperial Arms: Ornate and beautiful weapons created
shortly after the horror of the Scream, these arms
were developed by an unknown pocket empire
that somehow preserved a little of their pretech
manufacturing base. Their attempt to reimpose
order on the chaos around them appears to have
failed, but their legacy lingers in the scattered
weapons that remain from their far-flung armies.
An Imperial weapon grants its user a +1 bonus
to all hit and damage rolls, with projectile weapons having an unlimited supply of ammo. These
weapons always remain immaculately clean.

Fiat Lux: This manufacturer specialized in laser and
plasma weaponry. Their products were largely
conventional in function, but the quality of craftsmanship was seldom surpassed. Fiat Lux weaponry grants +2 to hit rolls and damage.
Nightfall Combine: The exact nature of the Nightfall
Combine was unclear even before the Scream,
with rumors of alien xenotech manufacturing
techniques and esoteric psitech materials research.
The weapons produced by the Combine were
some of the finest ever developed by humanity.
They grant +3 to all hit and damage rolls.
Omnipresence, Ltd.: A pretech manufacturer who specialized in holdout weaponry, Omnipresence arms
are composed of special polymorphic nano-compounds that are capable of shifting shape in moments. Omnipresence weaponry can take a single
alternate shape of the same mass set during manufacture, usually a belt, necklace, or other seemingly innocuous object. When gripped and a short
keycode is spoken, the item instantly shifts forms,
containing whatever ammunition it was originally loaded with. Shifted Omnipresence weapons
cannot be detected by any postech means; even
a pretech scanner will only reveal that the object
is composed of complex nanites. Omnipresence
weapons grant +1 to hit and damage rolls.
PolyGaia Defense: Originally an organization of militant pan-planetary animists, PolyGaia armaments
function perfectly in almost any environment.
Projectile and energy weapons are also equipped
with integral monoblades, and can be used as advanced medium melee weapons without a need to
club the weapon. PolyGaia weaponry grants +1 to
hit and damage rolls.
SamaelTech: The Sons of Samael were one of the myriad peculiar religious and ideological groups that
flourished during the Second Wave of human
expansion. While their exact beliefs are unclear
at this distance, their surviving melee armament
is invariably superb. Monoblades, kinesis wraps,
and other such SamaelTech weaponry all have +1
to hit and +1 damage. Some SamaelTech weapons appear to be decorated with Christian iconography and advanced nanotech cutting surfaces.
These pieces grant +2 to hit and damage.
Stardust Micropellet System: The “Stardust” system was
a cutting-edge effort to use gravitic manipulation
techniques in projectile weaponry. By giving a
tiny flake of matter the mass profile of a bullet, a
Stardust weapon never runs out of ammunition,
albeit Stardust weaponry cannot burst fire. Stardust weaponry gains +1 on all hit and damage rolls.
Tempus Fugit: The weapons of the Tempus Fugit armory employed Mandate temporal acceleration
generators. Such acceleration is exhausting to
the user, however, and creates severe strain on
a normal biological system. As an Instant action,

a wielder with the weapon in hand can take an
additional full round of action any time they
wish. At the end of this bonus action, they suffer
1d4 System Strain, +1 for each use of this ability
within the past 24 hours. If their System Strain is
maximized by this, they fall unconscious for one
hour. Tempus Fugit weapons have a +1 bonus to
hit and damage.
Terminus Est: A sister-company to Tempus Fugit, the
Terminus Est line of advanced melee weaponry
employed spatial distortion technology. As an
Instant action at the start of a round, a wielder
with the weapon in hand can nominate a visible
target; for the rest of the round, they’re treated as
if they’re adjacent and engaged in melee combat
with the target, hindering ranged attacks, subjecting them to attacks if they move away without a
fighting withdrawal, and so forth. The wielder is
not subject to attacks by the target unless they actually are within range of the target’s weapons. By
straining the wielder’s perception pathways, this
target nomination can be applied to a number of
targets equal to the wielder’s Stab skill plus two.
Any attack made against one target is applied to all
nominated targets, using the same die rolls. Each
round this multiple nomination is maintained, the
wielder takes 2 System Strain. All Terminus Est
weapons have a +2 bonus to hit and damage rolls.
Tools of Ill Omen: A specialist weapon line designed by
sage-engineers affiliated with the Preceptors of
the Great Archive, the Tools are decorated with
taotie-motif fittings similar to those of Shang
Dynasty bronzes. Tools usually appear as melee
weapons, particularly halberds, dagger-axes and
swords, though stylized hypervelocity repeating
crossbows have been found that work like mag
rifles with unlimited ammo. The Tools function
with a +2 hit and damage bonus
Valiance Arms: Somewhat stodgy by pretech standards,
Valiance never embraced the more exotic potentials of pretech science. The company instead
preferred to focus on precision low-recoil projectile weapons and high-quality craftsmanship.
Valiance projectile weapons grant +2 to hit and
damage rolls.
Windcutter: Windcutter armaments are invariably
edged melee weapons. Their pretech manufacturers had an obsessive interest in maximizing weapon penetration, one carried to an extent that was
very impressive, if perhaps somewhat impractical
for field use. A Windcutter blade can slice through
any substance short of advanced pretech armor
plating, inflicting full normal damage on vehicles,
including gravtanks or other targets subject only
to Heavy weapons. For Shock purposes, all targets are treated as if they were AC 10. Against all
targets, the blades have an effective +1 bonus to
hit and damage.

AI Companion: True AI was never easily made by pretech scientists. AIs required individual care during
their development, and a disturbing percentage of
them had to be “braked” at sub-human levels in
order to prevent runaway cogitation on imponderable philosophical questions and the ensuing
metastatic insanity that followed. Some AIs managed to attain a human level of sentience before
requiring brakes. The less brilliant of these AIs
could be contained in hardware no larger than five
or six centimeters on a side, usually with integral
sensors and vocalization units. If an AI companion
takes a liking to a PC, they can be useful allies; they
all have effective Program and Fix skills at level 3
or greater, and may have additional capabilities.
A distressing number of these AIs have their own
purposes, however, that are not necessarily complementary to those of their “owners”.
Integrity Stims: Usually found in the form of a skinspray applicator, integrity stims restore 2d6+2 hit
points to a subject for each dose applied. Each dose
increases the target’s System Strain by 1 point, and
the stims are useless to those with maximized System Strain. More than one dose can be triggered
into a subject in one round, but each dose after the
first adds an additional second System Strain point
from the sudden overload of stimulants.
Juggernaut Stims: Originally designed for pretech shock
troops, this skinspray stimulant charges the user
with fearless aggression and indifference to pain.
The user immediately gains 3d6 temporary hit
points and +2 to hit for a period of ten rounds. At
the end of that period, any remaining temporary
hit points are lost, and the subject suffers -2 to hit
for the next hour as their system recovers. Use of
this stim adds 1 point of System Strain.
Micropurgator Stims: A sprayhypo laden with a revivifying cocktail of nanites and support chemicals, a
micropurgator stim will remove 1d4 points of accrued System Strain from the user. Only one such
stim can be applied to a person within 24 hours.
Mindwall Helmet: A transparent-visored helmet, this
headpiece strengthens the integrity of the wearer’s
neural patterns, making it more difficult for them
to be influenced by mind-affecting psionic powers.
The wearer gains a +2 saving throw against any
such attack, and is automatically alerted by the
helmet if made the target of a telepathic power.
The helmet does not help against purely physical
psionic attacks, such as through telekinetics, and
it cannot be worn with powered armor, vacc suits,
or an assault suit.
Polymorphic Nanites: Usually found in two-kilo cylinders with integral input-output data ports,
polymorphic nanites were a late-Second Wave
development that promised to revolutionize
manufacturing. When fed a design schematic us-

ing standard pretech CAD/CAM protocols, the
nanites exude into the desired object, mimicking
any necessary physical properties. The nanites can
be used to create any object of equivalent or lesser mass, provided a datapad or the equivalent is
available to feed them the schematic. The nanites
are single-use, but multiple cylinders can be linked
together to create larger objects. The workmanship of the nanites is good, but not exceptional;
any available schematic of tech level 4 or less can
be produced.
Pseudonuke: While conventional TL4 nuke snuffers
make dangerous nuclear reactions impossible
near spaceships or modern civil defense systems,
a pseudonuke is designed with esoteric pretech
parts and techniques to bypass TL4 defenses. Most
pseudonukes are no larger than a briefcase but can
detonate with enough force to wipe out a large
city or space station. The handful created before
the Scream were deniable Mandate tools to deal
with rebel frontier colonies. Those that survive
are spectacularly illegal on almost all worlds.
Redivivus Sheath: When found, a redivivus sheath resembles a tightly-rolled body bag with a fist-sized
computing module affixed to it. When a freshly-dead human body is sealed into the bag the
module releases a cloud of nanites to repair and
revive the subject. Revivification will work on any
victim no more than five minutes dead, assuming
the head is intact and most of their mass is present.
Subjects are revived in critically wounded condition with maximized System Strain. The redivivus
sheath functions only once before burning out.
System Reset Inductor: An array of pretech pharmaceuticals of truly heroic breadth, a sprayhypo full of
system reset inductor is one of the most powerful
concoctions ever devised by pretech biochemists.
On injection, the subject immediately loses all accrued System Strain points barring those permanently added by cyberware. The user can gain new
System Strain normally, but 48 hours after the inductor has been administered, the strain will catch
up with them. They fall immediately unconscious
with 1 hit point and maximized System Strain, and
will remain in a coma for 48 hours before awakening. Use of a second inductor before the first has
run its course will inevitably kill the subject within
five rounds of application, with no hope of revival
by psionic disciplines or conventional medical aid.
Wideawake Serum: Originally designed to facilitate
spike drills for single-man ships that couldn’t afford a sleeping pilot, wideawake serum gives the
user enormous vigor and alertness for up to seven
days at a time. The user need not sleep or even rest,
but during this time it is impossible to recover
accrued System Strain. A successful Heal check at
difficulty 10, made at most once per day, can flush
the drug from the user prematurely.

90• MODDING AND BUILDING EQUIPMENT

MODDING AND BUILDING EQUIPMENT
While truly sophisticated research and design often
requires resources beyond the reach of an adventuring
party, more modest workshops can allow a talented
technician with a healthy supply of after-market parts
to improve the quality of their own or their allies’ gear.
Without a full-fledged R&D department behind them,
a PC technician is generally limited to modifying and
improving existing gear.
A mod is an adjustment made to a specific piece
of tech to make it work better. These mods are finicky,
delicate, and often customized to the user. They aren’t
generally available on the market because they require
regular tuning and adjustment by a highly-skilled technician in order to keep them from degrading, or even
failing entirely. Mods require costly after-market parts
that can be expensive to acquire, and the most sophisticated ones require actual pretech salvage stripped from
advanced ancient technology. Normally, only TL4 gear
can be effectively modded, as more primitive tech isn’t
suitable for the advanced components involved.

Installing Mods

Building and installing a mod requires a well-equipped
TL4 workshop. It’s not necessary to have a full-fledged
fabrication plant, but the sort of resources that a professional repair tech or vehicle shop have are necessary
to assemble and adjust the tech. Such a shop can usually
be rented for 100 credits a day, or bought outright in a
city or other urban area for 25,000 credits. A starship’s
“Workshop” ship fitting will also qualify.
Mods have a minimum Fix skill required to install
or maintain them; a Customized mod requires Fix-1, for
example, while a Flexible mod takes Fix-2. Without this
skill level, the tech can’t build or install the mod, and
they can’t maintain it properly either.
Mods have a cost in credits or salvage. A tech with
access to a normal TL4 parts market can buy components with a credit cost, but certain highly sophisticated
mods require pretech components that can only be salvaged from certain ancient Mandate-era technological
devices. Not just any device will do for gathering these
components; these micronized fusion taps, antigrav
nodules, impact flexors, and polymorphic state controllers are found in only certain Mandate tech or in
rare ancient caches of unused components. A tech will
usually have to find these components as part of an
adventure, because those who have them need them
for their own purposes and will not part with them for
ordinary monetary compensation. The specific details
of these parts don’t matter for mod use, and they’re simply tracked as “salvage”. If a mod requires three units of
salvage, any three units will work, and it’s not normally
necessary for a tech to track down specific components.
Mods take time to build and install. It takes one
week per minimum skill level of the mod to build and

install it in the desired device. Thus, a Customized mod
takes a week to put in, while a Flexible mod takes two.
If a tech does nothing other than work, eat, and sleep,
they can halve these times, and an additional assistant
with at least Fix-0 skill can further halve the time.
Mods must be custom-built to specific objects. A
tech cannot build a “generic” mod and then just attach
it to a device; it must be carefully designed to fit exactly with that specific item, and sometimes even with a
specific user.

Mods and Maintenance

Mods require maintenance to keep functioning correctly. Overclocked hardware, bleeding-edge tech, and
experimental adjustments just don’t have the field durability of more standard gear, so a tech must apply daily
attention to the modded hardware if it’s not to fail. A
normal TL4 toolbox is required to maintain mods, but
no special parts are needed.
A tech’s Maintenance score is equal to the total of
their Intelligence and Constitution modifiers plus three
times their Fix skill level. The smarter and the longer a
tech can work, the more maintenance they can perform,
but their overall expertise as a technician is the most
crucial element. A tech can maintain a number of mods
equal to their Maintenance score without cutting into
their adventuring time or otherwise encumbering their
off-duty hours. This maintenance is assumed to take
place during downtime and doesn’t need to be tracked
specifically in play. If they do nothing but maintenance,
they can double their score, but this kind of dedication
requires sixteen-hour workdays.
If a mod goes without maintenance for 24 hours, it
stops working. If a mod goes without maintenance for
a week, the entire device it’s attached to stops working,
as the untuned mod has made it useless or dangerous to
use. Weapons can no longer be used in combat, armor
no longer gives protection, seizes up, or is too dangerous to wear, and other devices simply stop functioning.
A maintenance backlog on a device can be cleared by an
hour of work by a technician capable of maintaining it.

Building Conventional Gear

Sometimes a wrench jockey will want to build their
own equipment rather than purchase it off the shelf.
This may be because there’s no such gear for sale, the
equipment is illegal on this world, the tech wants it
cheaper than the vendors sell it, or the tech wants
to build a custom platform for their favorite mods.
The gear built this way must be feasible to create in a
workshop; guns, armor, and modestly-sized vehicles
are possible, but starship components and other major
constructions are not.
A tech requires a TL4 workshop to build most TL4
equipment. More primitive gear can be built with less

MODDING AND BUILDING EQUIPMENT •91
elaborate resources at the GM’s discretion. The workshop must be at least nominally capable of working with
the kind of gear the tech is building. A vehicle repair
shop will not have the tools to brew pharmaceuticals,
and a back-room electronics shop won’t have the lifts
to work on armored vehicles. If the tech needs to refit a
workshop to work on a particular type of unsupported
gear, they can pay half the shop’s original price to get
the needed tools. Starships with Workshop fittings are
always sufficient for personal gear modifications.
The tech needs a supply of parts. In any TL4 city
or sizable community, the tech can scrounge, barter,
or buy what they need from the locals. A tech working
in a shop out in the wilds can prepare by taking a few
footlockers full of materials that can fit in a vehicle or
on pack animals, buying a certain number of credits
worth of spare parts and hauling them along. Techs in
dire need can strip ancient high-tech ruins, battlefields,
and scrap heaps for parts if no better source is available.
Techs must decide whether the device they’re
building is to be jury-rigged, normal, or mastercrafted.
Jury-rigged devices are assembled out of cheap scrap,
bottom-tier components, and makeshift kludges.
They’re much cheaper to make than to buy, but they require constant attention to keep them operating. Normal devices work just as well as anything that you’d buy
off the shelf, but the lack of economies of scale and the
need to acquire all the parts at retail make them more
expensive than buying it off the shelf. Mastercrafted
gear is carefully built to support a tech’s own innovations and favorite modifications. They are extremely
expensive, but much easier to mod and maintain than
off-the-shelf tech.
Building the gear usually takes one month for a
vehicle and one week for a weapon, suit of armor, or
other portable device. Having at least one assistant with
Fix-0 will halve this time.
Jury-rigged devices cost one-quarter as much as
the normal device and take half the normal time to
build. If the tech has access to scrap or salvage, they
can assemble it at no cost, but it takes twice the normal
time to build it. A jury-rigged device counts as a mod
requiring Fix-0 to maintain. If it goes 24 hours without maintenance, it stops working. Jury-rigged devices
cannot be modded.
Normal devices cost twice as much as they would
off-the-shelf and take the normal amount of time to
build. They cannot be built with scrap or salvaged parts
unless the GM decides that the salvage is perfectly suited for this use. Drugs and other consumable goods must
be built as normal devices rather than jury-rigged or
mastercrafted ones.
Mastercrafted devices require costly premade
components and cost ten times as much as the normal
device, and require twice as much time to build. They
are ideal platforms for the tech’s own modifications,
however, and the first mod installed in the device requires no maintenance.

Sample Mods

The mods listed below are simply a sample of those a
GM might approve for their campaign. Weapon and
armor mods should not stack beyond a +3 bonus to AC,
hit rolls or damage rolls, and any mod improving a skill
check shouldn’t boost it by more than +1. A mod can
only be installed once on any given piece of equipment.
Autotargeting (Fix-2): The weapon has had micronized
kinetic targeting aids installed, granting a +1 bonus to hit rolls with it. Costs 4,000 credits.
Boosted (Fix-2): The weapon has been tuned for greater
damage output, adding +2 to the damage it does.
Costs 2,000 credits.
Bubbleseal (Fix-1): The armor is equipped with automatic pressure seals and emergency oxygen. It can
be triggered manually or activates automatically
on exposure to low pressure, functioning as a vacc
suit for up to one hour. Costs 5,000 credits.
Concealed (Fix-2): The device is disguised as a specific
different object of the same general mass. This
disguise will fool standard TL4 sensors, but not a
close physical inspection of the object. Costs ten
times the device’s base cost.
Customized (Fix-1): The weapon or armor has been
carefully tailored to a single specific user. When
used by that person, they get a +1 to hit with the
weapon or a +1 Armor Class bonus with armor.
Costs 1,000 credits and is inapplicable to shields.
Extended Magazine (Fix-1): The firearm has been adjusted so that its magazine size is doubled. Costs
500 credits.
Flexible (Fix-2): The armor is carefully tailored to a
specific wearer with an eye towards reducing its
weight and cumbersomeness. Its Encumbrance
value is lowered by 1 for that wearer, and increased by 1 for anyone else. Costs 5,000 credits.
High Efficiency (Fix-1): A device with a duration of
operation, such as a vacc suit or fueled vehicle,
now functions for 50% longer on the same charge.
Costs five times the device’s usual cost.
Infinite Magazine (Fix-3): The firearm now automatically produces its own physical ammunition. Costs
10,000 credits and two units of pretech salvage.
Infinite Power (Fix-3): A device powered by a Type A
power cell now never runs out of power. Costs
5,000 credits and one unit of pretech salvage.
Phasing (Fix-3): The weapon is tuned to partially phase
through armor and impeding debris, granting a +1
bonus to hit rolls with it. Costs 10,000 credits and
two units of pretech salvage.
Polymorphic Blending (Fix-2): The armor can shift in
appearance to that of normal clothing or different-looking armor. Several dozen different appearances can be loaded into it at any one time.
The armor functions and encumbers normally
regardless of its external appearance. Costs 5,000
credits and one unit of pretech salvage.
