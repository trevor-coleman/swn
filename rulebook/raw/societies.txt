290• SOCIETIES

SOCIETIES
The tools for creating worlds in Stars Without Number are considerable, but some GMs want to flesh out
their worlds beyond the outlines provided by tags and
physical properties. This section discusses ways of adding societal meat to those basic bones, and some of the
considerations that a GM should keep in mind when
forging new cultures for their newly-fashioned worlds.

When To Do It

The first thing any GM needs to remember when creating a sci-fi culture for their games is that it should be
done for a reason. Just because you have a sector of 24
worlds doesn’t mean you should go through the time
and effort needed to give them 24 interesting and engaging cultural descriptions. As with all things sandbox,
just because something exists doesn’t mean you should
expend some of your limited time and creative energy
fleshing it out into a “completed” condition.
Instead, you should give a world a fully-built culture when it becomes important to your specific needs.
If you know the PCs are going to visit the world of
Mephisto during the next session, then it’s a very good
idea to spend some time generating and polishing Mephistan society. If you’re setting up a sector’s social and
cultural fault lines at the start of your campaign, it can
pay off to do some very cursory generation for each
world so you have a vague idea of the kind of interactions they might be having when the campaign actually
starts. If these factors aren’t a consideration for you,
however, and you’re just starting the PCs out in a situation where foreign worlds aren’t going to be a major
factor for a session or two, then there’s no point in
expending the energy to define more of your sandbox
than you need just yet.
With that in mind, your basic rule for when to
create a planet’s culture is simple; do it when you know
it will be directly relevant in the immediate future of
your game. Not when “it’s going to be important eventually”, not when “it would be nice to have”, but when
you know you are going to need it in the next session or
two. Of course, if you’re having fun building societies
then you should do it as long as it stays that way, but
you should never do taxing sandbox work that isn’t
fun and doesn’t promise to pay off in the immediately
foreseeable future.

The Purposes of Culture

There’s a school of worldbuilding that favors the detailed and intricate construction of a society, complete
with calendars, wedding customs, exotic social structures, and elaborate history. Adherents of this school
point out that these details, while not immediately germane to the usual sorts of adventures, give the GM the
grounding and familiarity they need to rapidly respond
to player questions and ideas, and improve the sense of

alienness and verisimilitude the players experience in
entering that culture.
And they’re right. If you spend the time and effort
required to build out a culture to an anthropological
level of completeness, you really will get those advantages. Unfortunately, there are very few creators who
have the time, energy, and particular skill set to effectively build societies like that. It’s possible you’ve nurtured ideas of an alien world and its society from boyhood, ventured forth into the distant Indian jungles to
live with tribal people and learn their languages, took a
foreign bride and religion, returned to a distinguished
academic career, and spent your twilight years in the
study of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics, but most of
us are not named Phil and do not have the background
to readily produce truly alien, coherent societies. For
the rest of us, building a society involves rather more
modest goals and simpler methodology.
For us, the purpose of building a society is twofold: we do it to create adventure hooks, and to make
running adventures in that society more manageable.
These are the reasons to build a society and these are
the purposes that should be ever foremost in your mind
as you go through the pages that follow. The finest,
most elaborate, most anthropologically-coherent culture is useless to you as a GM if it isn’t providing you
with any adventure seeds and is too involved to easily
run adventures among its associated people.

Planting the Seeds

The generators that follow focus on identifying conflicts between groups, between rulers and ruled, between different factions of ruled, between people and
their circumstances, or between the likely needs of the
PCs and the rules of the greater society. Conflicts are
the seeds of adventure, and it’s important that the cultures you build have meaningful, accessible conflicts for
the PCs to encounter.
These conflicts come on different scales. They can
be purely personal problems relevant only to the PCs,
such as a taboo on entering a particular place where
a macguffin lies that the PCs need to recover. They
can be local struggles, such as a corrupt community
leader who’s masking his venality behind a facade of
“reform” and the angry traditionalists who oppose him
for mixed reasons. And, of course, they can be the kind
of world-spanning afflictions that are so beloved of
storytellers, like a massive planetary civil war between
factions of the ruling nobility.
Whatever the scale, these conflicts need to be accessible. They need to be something that affects the
PCs, and preferably something that the PCs can affect
in turn. A massive civil war that’s taking place on the
opposite side of the planet and which has no bearing on
what the PCs are doing right now is a wasted piece of

SOCIETIES •291

worldbuilding effort. Not every conflict has to shadow
every adventure the PCs have in the society, but the
players should regularly feel that the local situation has
a significant influence in what they’re trying to accomplish here.
Conflicts are your cheap and easy adventure generators. Whenever you have a societal conflict, you
have at least two opposing sides, something they’re
struggling over, and an obvious need for third parties
to come in and lend a hand to one or more of the participants. PCs tend to be ideal deniable agents for the
various sides of a conflict, as they’re people with no ties
to the “enemy” side, a usual appetite for credits, and no
reason to feel passionately about most of the conflicts
they encounter. As a GM, you should embrace this opportunity for the various participants in a conflict to
hire the PCs out as muscle or agents for their causes.
Not all conflicts involve struggling locals, however. Some conflicts have to do with the clash between
the structures of society and the desires of the PCs. It’s
common for a society to have a taboo, law, custom, or
expectation that directly interferes with something the
PCs want to accomplish. These are the customs that the
players will remember and care about, because these
are the customs that are causing them trouble. Very
few players will care about or remember the details of
Mephistan wedding ceremonies unless their wealthy
patron is getting married tomorrow and they know
that assassination attempts on wedding days are traditional and accepted among the Mephistan elite.

Building for Speed

When you’re creating a fictional society for a sci-fi
world, don’t hesitate to reach for existing real-world
models or familiar science fiction tropes. The more
you have to explain a society to your players, the less
confident they’re going to be about interacting with
it and the more hesitant they’ll be to make the kind of
easy assumptions that smooth play at the table. If there
are no clear local analogs for bars, police, gangsters,
factories, or black-market quasinuclear explosives, a lot
of players are going to end up feeling paralyzed with
uncertainty when they try to adventure in the society.
When players interact with your societies, let
them be right whenever it’s practical. If they make
an assumption or act based on a logical expectation,
either let them be correct or gently adjust things to
a culture-appropriate equivalent. If they keep getting
burned by their basic assumptions, their instinct is going to be to stop interacting with the society.
Also be prepared for indifference on the part of the
players. Even the most cooperative group is unlikely
to be as interested in your fictional creations as you
are; they’re interested in their fictional creations. You
don’t have to build an anthropologically-precise society
description because your players honestly won’t care
enough about it to require that level of detail. If it turns
out they’re enchanted by your work, then that’s great.
You can elaborate things then, when it matters. Until
then, focus on what you know you’re going to need.

292• ORIGIN OF THE SOCIETY

THE ORIGIN OF THE SOCIETY
To understand a world’s society, it’s necessary to understand its origins. Every world was founded for a
purpose, and while this purpose may have changed in
the intervening years, it’s going to have had a powerful
effect on the original colonists and their way of life.
For simplicity’s sake, it’s assumed that there’s only
one society on the planet that the PCs are going to care
about. This may be the only actual society that exists on
the world, or it might just be the most advanced, xenophilic, or profitable group for outsiders to interact with.
You can use the following tables to create multiple societies, but even the most heavily balkanized world is
likely to have the same basic origin for all its cultures,
unless the world was actually hit with multiple colony
groups who came for different reasons.

What to Get from Origins

As a GM, you should be looking for adventure hooks
in a society’s origins. The roots of a world offer an
easy backstory for ancient ruins, lost cities, abandoned
moon outposts, or dangerous man-made badlands.
They also give a cue about what the society is likely to
consider most important, or at least what the original
founders cared about most.
The origins are also going to leave their mark on
what the society has inherited. If the world was colonized as a mining outpost, it’s very likely that the locals will still have significant mining expertise and tech
preservation, and might still be living in the ancient
played-out mines of their ancestors. If the world was
originally a prison planet, the prisons might still exist,
transformed into fortresses and strongholds where the

heirs of ancient gang bosses and prison wardens rule
over the offspring of long-forgotten convicts. Even
when all physical artifacts of the past have been erased,
social patterns and cultural subgroups can still bear the
marks of the original colonists.
Many societies will have experienced at least one
period of drastic change between their founding and
the present day, usually catalyzed by the chaos of the
Scream and the loss of easy interstellar contact. This
breakdown is a good excuse for justifying substantial
differences between the original, long-lost colony and
their modern inheritors. It may be that the colony
failed entirely, and the current culture stems from an
entirely different colonization effort that took place
decades or centuries later.
If this society isn’t the only one on the planet, you
may want to make a few decisions about the other major cultures on the world. Namely, you may want to
give them names, a sentence or two describing them,
and a sentence indicating their relationship with the
culture you’re generating. It’s rarely worth the effort
to completely generate these additional groups unless
the players take a significant interest in the planet. All
you really need is are the basic details to let them know
that the culture they’re working with right now isn’t
the only meaningful group on the planet.
Also remember that not every original reason for
colonization is a good reason. Surveyors and scouts can
make mistakes like anyone else, trade routes can shift,
military deployments can alter, and what once seemed
like a good reason for a colony can crumble overnight.
Some worlds may still be dealing with such aftermath.

ONE-ROLL ORIGINS
To devise a society’s origins, roll one die of each type:
d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20, and compare the results
to the tables on this page. Not every table is necessarily pertinent to every society, and you may choose to
manually pick or tweak results to fit a good idea you
have, but these tables can give you a basic framework
when no better ideas leap easily to mind.
If you have multiple colonizing groups or societies,
you might roll more than once on these tables, or roll
multiple times and synthesize the results into a single situation. As with all the tables in this section, you
should be ready to use them as rough inspiration and
grist for your own campaign’s specific needs, rather
than as hard creative dictates that you need to obey.

294• RULERS

THE SOCIETY’S RULERS
Some exotic human cultures might persist with no visible ruling class. The population might be synced into a
telepathic hive mind, it might operate on some transhuman distributed democratic principle, or it might be
so brutally primitive that there exists no organization
above the family band. In most cases, however, your
culture is going to have a ruling class, and these tables
will help you determine what that class is and how they
govern the rest of the populace.

What to Get from Rulers

When you build a ruling class, understand that the players are apt to encounter them in two contexts: either
as antagonists who are stopping the PCs from accomplishing some desired end, or as patrons who are employing the PCs to achieve some work that can’t comfortably be assigned to existing minions. You should
be thinking carefully about the kind of agents of rule
who are likely to be dealing with the PCs, either as law
enforcement or as potential employers.
Spare a moment to think about the kind of law
enforcement and governmental control that exists in
this society. Do police exist? How attentive are they
to disturbances or violations of the law? Do the locals
tend to deal with such problems personally, or is force
firmly monopolized in government hands?

And if the PCs do encounter law enforcement,
what are the likely outcomes? Can they bribe their way
out of trouble? What kind of firepower do the agents of
the ruling class have at their disposal? And how plausible is it for officials to want adventure-worthy “favors”
from lawbreaking offworlders?
Just as PCs can be obstructed by the rulers and
their minions, so too can they be employed by them.
Offworlders make excellent catspaws due to their easy
deniability, rapid departures from the planet, and lack
of scruples regarding local laws and expectations. It’s
not impossible for an important local noble or official
to cultivate a useful group of adventurers, gradually
offering them jobs that both demonstrate their skills
and bind them all the more tightly to their patron. It
can pay off to prepare at least one sample NPC patron
from the ruling class just to have them available on
short notice if an adventure hook arises.
The more tightly the government controls the society, the more the government will matter to PCs. For
a lot of parties, there’s just no interest in the details of
a world’s rulers until it becomes an immediate threat
or opportunity for the PCs. If your adventure plans
seem likely to put the PCs in contact with the rulers,
whether as agents or as irritants, you’ll need to have
some appropriate preparation ready to deploy.

RULERS •295

ONE-ROLL RULERS
These tables generate a quick governmental framework
for your society, along with some idea of their most
pressing current problems and instabilities. An NPC
patron is very likely to give PCs jobs related to these
problems and intra-class struggles, or ask them to help
deal with some aspect of the conflict they’re having
with restive commoners.
Keep in mind the likely reactions of your group
when devising NPC patrons or antagonists. Some
groups of players will have a visceral distaste for helping the rulers of particularly harsh worlds, while other
parties will have fewer fictional scruples. If you can’t
see your player group ever wanting to play nice with
the slave-masters of a world fueled by cannibal sacrifice,
then you’re best off not wasting time making patrons.

296• RULED

THE RULED CLASSES
The Great Unwashed, the Teeming Masses, the broad
foundation upon which the ruling edifice rests; these
are the common folk of the society who keep it operating and pay the prices their rulers exact. This group
is very rarely uniform on any world and in any culture.
Most often it is divided up into numerous different
interest groups, ones based on ethnicity, religion, economics, or regions. Many of the stresses that rest on
the ruling class revolve around reconciling the many
conflicting demands of their restive subjects.

What to Get from Commoners

The commoners of this society are the ones your PCs
are most likely to encounter in their adventures. Shopkeepers, thugs, workers, farmers, ship crew, and other
rank-and-file NPCs will belong to this group, so it’s
important to have some idea what these NPCs are likely
to care about and how they draw distinctions among
their own kind.
To an outsider, the swarming masses of a world
can appear virtually indistinguishable, but commoners
almost always have a keen awareness of countless small
differences that might seem irrelevant to an outsider.
Differences in regional extraction, religious sects, political partisanship, or ethnic bloodlines can be tremendously important to the locals.

You can use these distinctions to create adventure-worthy conflicts that revolve around commoner
issues. It’s not always the rulers who care about strife
between different groups of locals; sometimes the PCs
are the ones caught in a bad situation, when an NPC
ally or a vital macguffin gets embroiled in a local feud
that outworlders can barely understand.
Not every commoner group is sharply balkanized.
Sometimes there is a strong and uniform feeling of
unity among the society, with differences downplayed
or dismissed by its membership. Even in these societies, conflicts can exist on a personal scale between
members, or there can exist basic structural conflicts
between the rulers and the ruled class. This is especially
pronounced when the commoners have a very strong
sense of societal unity that does not include the ruling class. Threatened governments in such a situation
might intentionally exacerbate divisions in the ruled
class in order to prevent a united front from forming
against their continued rule, creating situations where
PCs have to bring people together despite the meddling
of a self-interested government.
Foreign governments or offworld agents also have
a vested interest in fomenting divisions among the
common class. A unified rival is a dangerous rival, and
one drowned in strife is more safely distracted.

RULED •297

ONE-ROLL RULED
Most of these tables revolve around building the ruled
class’ relationship with its rulers. These tables will tell
you how uniform the ruled class is, how happy they are
with the current leadership, the last time they were a
serious threat to the ruling government, and the reason the government can’t simply roll over them. An
adventure about the hopeless and futile resistance of
a rebel cell might make for nice dystopian fiction, but
for an evening’s play it leaves something to be desired.
Don’t worry about detailing the specific look of
the common class yet. These tables give you the background for conflicts and problems that are likely to
make good adventure grist. Once you have that material in hand, you can then move on to flavoring the
group with the details you need to use them in play.

298• FLAVORING THE SOCIETY

FLAVORING THE SOCIETY
The final step in creating your society is to give them
some overall flavor to tie up the bundle of conflicts,
strifes, and problems you’ve already given them. The
high-level issues of a society are important for building adventures, but when PCs walk down the starship
gangway, they want to know what kind of buildings
and people they see. When they decide to go to a bar or
look up a weapons dealer, you need to have some idea
of what the NPCs look like and what their food, dress,
and architecture might resemble.
The simplest first step is to pick one or more real-world cultures and mix them into a sci-fi equivalent
that fits the world’s tags and physical circumstances.
You can draw from this culture for details of naming,
clothing, religion, cuisine, and other details of daily life
that can be important for running an adventure. It’s
not necessary to worry about “getting it right”; it’s been
more than a thousand years since the present day. Between natural cultural drift and forcible Mandate social
engineering, very few far-future cultures are identical
to the ones that currently or historically exist on Earth.
It’s also possible to fabricate an entirely unique
culture with no major reference to an existing society.
While this can be a refreshing exercise of creativity, it’s
also a tremendous amount of work. Every time you
find yourself unable to reference a familiar trope or
idea, you need to take the time to explain the details to
the players. This can be interesting and novel the first
few times you do it, but if the players need a half-hour
of gaming time just to find something equivalent to a
spacer hostel and a hot meal, they can get bored and
frustrated with the relentless worldbuilding.
The more practical course is to take a basic, familiar framework and then add those unique elements that
important to you and the adventure. Concentrate your
creative effort on the bits that matter most in play. It’s
true that any trait can be significant in one situation or
another, but it’s safer to play to the averages.

Aside from the kind of external flavor a GM needs
to represent NPCs in the society, it’s also important
to think about the ways in which they interact with
outsiders like the PCs.
A rigidly xenophobic culture that wants nothing to
do with offworlders might have some use as a monolithic obstacle to some PC goal, but any effort spent
detailing its internal workings is wasted if the PCs will
never be put in a position to care about them. Even the
most suspicious society should likely have some way
for an outsider to interact with it, even if the process
amounts to an adventure in its own right.
In the same vein, giving the culture special quirks
or habits can be useful, but you should keep an eye
toward making these quirks pertinent to adventure
goals. A history of bloody vendettas between the great
families can flavor casual street scenes, but the PCs are
unlikely to actually care about that detail until it rears
up to interfere with a plan they have or a goal they
want to accomplish.
Taken as a whole, the players will care about those
parts of a culture that matter to them. When flavoring
your culture, you should try to make sure that as much
of your effort as possible is dedicated to those parts of
your society that will actually be influential to your play.

ONE-ROLL SOCIETY FLAVOR
These tables provide some quick answers for creating
a society’s attitude toward outsiders, game-meaningful
quirks, and potential patrons for adventures. In all cases, you’re going to need to mold the results to the society outline you’ve already created; an official in need of
deniable assets is going to look very different in a modern bureaucratic state than they would on a balkanized
world of tribal warlords. Even so, a colorless agent of a
deniable state agency and the mother of a warlord stuck
in a reluctant tribal alliance both have the same need for
discretion and ruthlessness in their agents.
Societal vices and virtues can be used to color local
conflicts. It’s very possible for a society’s own virtues
to be the seeds of struggle and calamity when they are
taken too far or put in a situation with no clear answer.
