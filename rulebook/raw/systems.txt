SYSTEMS
Even the most capable interstellar adventurer sometimes encounters a situation where the outcome is by
no means certain. When an alien assassin thrusts a
blade at an unguarded back, or the ship threatens to
careen out of control in a gas giant’s upper atmosphere,
or when the hero has been critically injured and lies
bleeding on a cavern floor, how do you tell what’s going
to happen next? This chapter provides you with certain
basic systems you can use to resolve these questions.

The Basic Mechanics

The three primary systems that most heroes are going to interact with most often are skill checks, saving throws, and combat rounds. Every player and GM
ought to read those sections and understand the basic
mechanisms involved, because they’re going to be seeing a lot of them in their star-faring adventures.
Skill checks tell you whether or not your hero succeeds at a particular feat of expertise or natural competence. Whenever it’s uncertain whether or not your
hero can manage a feat, your GM might call for a skill
check. Failure at the roll means that your hero either
botched it outright, succeeded in a way that was singularly unhelpful, or was foiled by some unexpected
outside influence.
Saving throws tell you whether or not your hero
evades some immediate peril. If you need to know
whether or not the alien insect’s poison overwhelms
you, or if you can dive away from the grenade before
it explodes, or if the villainous psychic’s mind-reading
powers can pry out your secrets, you make a saving
throw. The GM will tell you when you should be making one.
Combat rounds tell you whether or not your hero
has shot, stabbed, exploded, maimed, punched, or otherwise ventilated their foe, and whether the foe has
managed to do the same to them. Combat in Stars
Without Number is very dangerous, especially to novice
adventurers and ordinary NPCs. One thug with a pistol
and a steady hand can kill most newly-minted heroes
with a single well-aimed bullet, and most normal men
and women have even less of a chance against lethal
violence. Warrior heroes and others with a specific talent for combat are more durable against these martial
perils, but even they have to respect the threat of a mob
of angry spearmen or a sniper rifle’s crosshairs.
The combat section is a particularly important
read if your own gaming history has lent itself more
towards games that have very sturdy protagonists or
narratively-shielded player characters. A first-level
Warrior in Stars Without Number is lethally dangerous
to an ordinary street thug or faceless enemy minion,
but three or four mooks with street-built slugthrowers
are likely to put that budding hero down hard. More
experienced PCs gain a larger margin of safety as they

gain more hit points, but there’s no PC that can laugh
off a dozen combat infantrymen with mag rifles and a
will to use them. Don’t assume your character is going
to survive an experience just because they’re a PC.

Using the Systems

Stars Without Number is built to support a sandbox
gaming experience, and the systems in this chapter
are part of that. By default, they’re meant to be fair,
understandable, and flexible enough to be applied to
many situations. They’re not meant to especially favor the PCs, however, or to give them ways to bypass
the results of some poor decision or unlucky moment.
There is no “narrative currency” the player can spend
to avert disaster. This is not the only way a group can
play the game, but it is intentionally the default mode.
It’s not that these systems are perfect, but that
they are an unbiased third party to your gaming session. When the GM calls for a skill check, or rolls a hit
roll for an alien warlord’s chainaxe, he honestly doesn’t
know what’s going to happen. His judgment might apply bonuses or penalties to the dice, or he might choose
to tweak the system to fit the immediate situation, but
ultimately the dice are resolving the situation. This is
important for a sandbox game, because the dice are as
fair as they are merciless.
This fairness adds surprise and interest to a night’s
gaming. Even the GM isn’t completely certain what’s
going to happen when the PCs forge ahead, and this
surprise and novelty help keep the GM interested in
events, and not just a programmatic maestro for preset situations and outcomes. Every gaming session is
a chance for something unexpected to boil out of a
chance throw of the dice, whether that happens when
the PCs catastrophically botch their attempt to defuse
a nuclear fission bomb or when that alien warlord just
happens to catch a ten-kilo demolitions charge with
his chestplate. Even when cruel dice fell a heroic PC,
that very degree of danger helps make the rest of the
party’s survival more meaningful. They lived because
they made good choices and had a bare minimum of
luck, not because they were the designated heroes.
Not all groups will want to play the game this way,
however, and that too is perfectly acceptable. Some
groups do want to let Fate weigh in on their side, and
let death and disaster have to get through a little more
narrative armor first. A GM running a game like this
can often produce this effect without the need for explicitly changing die rolls or introducing destiny chips,
simply by deciding on gentler outcomes for failures,
minimizing murder-obsessed enemies, and explicitly
arranging escape routes for overmatched PCs. This
game belongs to you and your group, and you should
run it the way you want it to be run.

46• SYSTEMS

SCENES AND DURATIONS
Many psychic abilities and other powers have durations
expressed in scenes. A scene is just a shorthand concept
for a particular action sequence or exertion on the part
of the PCs. A single combat encounter is a scene, as is
the infiltration of a building, the ascent of a radioactive
mountainside, or a tense meeting with an alien overlord’s cybernetic representative. Most scenes don’t last
for longer than fifteen minutes or a single contiguous
chunk of action, but the maximum duration is up to
the GM’s discretion. It’s quite possible to have an eve-

ning’s play where most of the time isn’t tracked, only
marking scenes for important negotiations, gunfire, or
time-critical feats of skill.
Some powers are limited to being used only so
many times in a given scene, or require Effort expenditures that only come back at the end of the scene.
Outside of situations where close time-tracking is important, you can assume that these powers can be used
or that the Effort comes back about once every fifteen
minutes, assuming the PC has intervals for rest.

SAVING THROWS
There are times when misfortune or unpredictable peril befalls a hero. Only luck or their own natural hardiness can save them from disaster, and to do so they
must make a saving throw.
Saving throws come in three kinds. Physical saves
relate to challenges of physical endurance such as poisons, diseases, radiation, or dire exhaustion. Evasion
saves involve dodging explosions, evading falling hazards, diving back from a crumbling surface, or otherwise exerting one’s powers of speed and swift reaction.
Mental saves relate most often to psychic influences,
hallucinations, esoteric mental control technologies,
and other perils that assault a hero’s mind or perceptions. Mental saves can also be used when no other
saving throw category seems to apply and only blind
luck and ineffable intuition can save the hero.

Your character’s saving throw scores start at 15,
and decrease by one point each time you advance a
level. Each saving throw is modified by the best modifier of two different attributes: Physical by the better
of Strength or Constitution, Evasion by the better of
Dexterity or Intelligence, and Mental by the better of
Charisma or Wisdom. Thus, a first-level PC with a
Strength of 5 and a Constitution of 14 would have a
Physical save of 14.
To make a save, roll 1d20 and try to equal or beat
the appropriate saving throw score. On a success, you
evade or mitigate the peril, while on a failure it takes
full effect. A natural roll of 1 is always a failure, and a
natural roll of 20 is always a success.
The GM decides when a saving throw is appropriate. Some dangers might not allow one at all.

Poison and Peril
While cutting their way through the blue jungles
of Qinglin, a luxuriant blossom of cerulean crystal
catches Eden’s eye. The young adventuress is eager
to find something to make their reeking weeks in
this azure Hell worthwhile for her and her brother
Randall, but she’s no fool, and promptly extends her
3.048-meter probe pole to gently joggle the bloom
from a safe distance away.
The two adventurers are so focused on their
examination of the flower that they risk missing the
stealthy creep of a many-legged creature that approaches through the undergrowth. The GM calls
for Wis/Notice skill checks from both of the PCs.
Eden’s Wisdom modifier of +0 and lack of the Notice
skill leave her with a -1 penalty. She rolls 2d6 and
gets a 6. Her brother Randall has a Wisdom modifier
of +1 and Notice-0 skill, which gives him a net +1
bonus on his roll, and a result of 11.
The GM decides that sneaking through the
undergrowth is a sort of thing that venomous alien
hunters would be good at, so he applies the creature’s

+1 skill bonus to its own stealth roll. Unfortunately
for the young heroes, it rolls a 12, approaching the
pair undetected.
The GM rolls randomly to see which of the pair
is closest and finds that Randall is the unlucky winner. The dog-sized monstrosity leaps on the psychic
and stabs him with its venomous proboscis.
The GM knows that the poison of this dread
beast is enough to kill an unlucky victim in a matter
of minutes. But did Randall receive a lethal dose? He
asks Randall’s player to make a Physical saving throw.
The psychic’s Physical saving throw target is 14,
so his player reaches for a d20 and rolls, coming up
with a natural 20 on the dice. A natural 20 is always
a success, even if penalties would otherwise make
the roll a failure.
Randall staggers under the attack, but most of
the beast’s poison stains his armor harmlessly. He’s
shaky, but can push through the dose he got with no
ill effects. That’s a good thing, because that scuttler’s
egg-mate is hurrying up through the brush…

SKILL CHECKS •47

SKILL CHECKS
Most characters are skilled, competent men and women who are perfectly capable of carrying out the ordinary duties of their role. Sometimes, however, they are
faced with a situation or challenge beyond the usual
scope of their role and must make a skill check.
To make a skill check, roll 2d6 and add the most
relevant skill level and attribute modifier. If the total is
equal or higher than the check’s difficulty, the check is a
success. On a failure, the PC either can’t accomplish the
feat at all or they achieve it at the cost of some further
complication to the situation. The GM determines the
specific outcome of a failure.
If the character doesn’t even have level-0 in the
pertinent skill, they suffer a -1 penalty to the roll. In
the case of particularly technical or esoteric skills they
might not even be able to attempt the skill check at all.
Some checks might be suitable for more than
one skill. A javelin-throwing contest might use Exert
for being an athletic contest, or Shoot for involving a
ranged weapon, or Stab for using a muscle-powered
thrown weapon. In such cases the PC can use the best
applicable skill. In other situations, a skill might seem
peripherally relevant; trying to find the hidden bomb
in a starship’s engine core before it detonates might certainly use Notice or Fix, but a GM might also let Pilot
be applied, as a veteran pilot might be expected to know
what their engine should look like. In such peripheral
cases, the check difficulty usually increases by 2.

8

Skill Check Difficulties
A relatively simple task that is still more than
the PC would usually be expected to manage
in their regular background. Anything easier
than this isn’t worth a skill check.
A significant challenge to a competent professional that they’d still succeed at more often
than not.

10

Something too difficult to be expected of
anyone but a skilled expert, and even they
might fail.

12

Only a true master could expect to carry this
off with any degree of reliability.

14+

Only a true master has any chance of achieving this at all, and even they will probably fail.

Particularly helpful or hostile circumstances might
give a bonus or penalty to the skill check. As a general
rule, extremely bad circumstances or tools would apply up to a -2 penalty to the skill check, while a very
good situation or the perfect set of tools might give up
to a +2 bonus to the roll. Usually, no combination of
modifiers should add more than +2 or -2 to any given
skill check.

When To Call for a Check

Skill checks should only be called for challenges that fall
outside the PC’s background and common experience.
A PC with the background of a starship pilot should
not be rolling skill checks to land a ship or navigate to
an in-system destination. As a general rule of thumb,
if failure at a particular task would make the PC seem
notably incompetent at their role in life, then they
shouldn’t have to roll a skill check for it. In addition, if
failure or success at a check really doesn’t matter in the
game, if it won’t produce some interesting result either
way, then a check shouldn’t be made.
Even concept-related feats might require a skill
check, however, if the situation is especially bad or
the circumstances particularly hostile. The pilot might
have to make a Pilot skill check to land a ship if they
attempt it in the middle of a man-killing sandstorm,
and a noble might have to make a Connect skill check
to find shelter with an aristocratic relation if they’re
currently wanted by the stellar tyrant’s guards.

Aiding a Skill Check

Sometimes one PC will want to lend a hand to another
as they attempt a difficult feat. To do this, the player
first describes what sort of action they are taking to
help their comrade. If the GM agrees that their effort
makes sense and would be helpful, the player then rolls
a relevant skill check against the same difficulty as the
original check. If it’s a success, the other PC gets a +1
bonus on their roll. Multiple PCs can try to help, but
the acting PC can’t earn more than a +1 total bonus.
The helping skill doesn’t necessarily have to be the
same skill the PC is checking. If a player can think of
a way to help a Sneak check with Talk, then so be it.

Opposed Skill Checks

Sometimes a PC wants to accomplish something that
another character wants to prevent. Sneaking past an
alert guard, winning a shooting tournament, or besting
an alien in a tentacle-wrestling competition might all
be opposed skill checks.
In such cases, all participants roll their relevant
skills and the highest score wins, with ties going to
the PC. To make the NPC’s roll, check their listed skill
bonus; they can add it to any skill check appropriate to
their role or profession. If the NPC has no reason to
be particularly good at the challenge, they simply roll
2d6 and add nothing.
In most cases, the relevant skills are obvious. A
character trying to skulk past a vigilant guard would be
rolling their Dex/Sneak against the guard’s roll, while
one trying to out-tentacle an alien would be rolling Str/
Exert. When in doubt, the GM decides which skill is
most applicable.

48• COMBAT

COMBAT
Sometimes the only reasonable response to a situation
involves drawn monoblades and heavy plasma fire. In
such unfortunate hours your heroes will have to engage in combat.
Combat in Stars Without Number is a lethal sort of
experience, especially for novice interstellar adventurers. Even hardened Warriors can go down in a hurry
under a withering hail of mag rifle fire or the scrapsteel knives of a hiveworld gang pack. PCs should be
very certain that the odds are in their favor before they
reach for their laser pistols, and even then, the gods of
battle can be cruel.

Rounds and Initiative

Combat and other time-sensitive situations are divided
up into rounds. Each round is approximately six seconds, during which all participants may act. When everyone has acted, the round ends and a new one begins.
To determine who acts first in a round, each participant rolls initiative. Each rolls 1d8 and adds their
Dexterity modifier. NPCs usually have no modifier.
The participants then act in order, high roll to low,
with PCs winning ties. When everyone has had a turn
to act, the sequence starts over again from the top. Initiative is not re-rolled.
Optionally, the GM may choose to use group initiative instead in their campaigns. The PC with the best
Dexterity bonus rolls for the party, and the GM rolls
one die for the other NPCs. Members of the side that
rolled highest may act first in whatever order they wish,
and then the next-highest side acts. While easier to
manage, it also increases the value of winning initiative,
and can leave the heroes in dire peril if a large group
of foes wins the roll.
Sometimes a person is surprised or ambushed.
Most ambushes involve a contested Dex/Sneak roll
against a target’s Wis/Notice check, with the defender
winning ties. In other cases the surprise may be practically inevitable, such as a disguised assassin suddenly
lashing out with a monoblade in the middle of a society
ball. Ambush targets who fail the contested roll are surprised. A surprised target doesn’t get to roll initiative
until the second round of combat and can perform only
Instant actions while surprised. NPCs with roles relevant to being vigilant or stealthy would gain their skill
bonus to these checks, while others would simply roll
an unmodified 2d6 for the opposed check.
Most PCs are not subject to surprise unless their
guard is genuinely down at the moment of the ambush
or attack. Someone walking in a dangerous part of a
city or picking their way through a seemingly-abandoned space station is unlikely to be astonished by the
sudden appearance of danger, unless the attack is so
sudden and from such an unexpected quarter that even
their obvious caution is insufficient.

Types of Actions

When an actor’s turn comes up in the round, they may
perform actions. Actions are divided into four different
types: Main Actions, Moves, On Turn actions, or Instant.
Main Action
One per Turn
Every actor can make one Main Action each round.
Main Actions are those deeds that are going to absorb
most of the six-second round, such as attacking an enemy, bracing a door, applying first aid to a downed ally,
digging a Stowed item out of a pack, manipulating a
complex device, or some other activity that takes up
their focus. In place of their Main Action, an actor can
take a second Move action.
Move Action

One per Turn

Every actor can make one Move action each round,
running up to 10 meters. This movement assumes that
an actor is dodging enemies, paying attention to the
surroundings, navigating awkward terrain, and generally dealing with the hazards of a battlefield. Climbing
a surface, swimming, or passing extremely rough terrain halves this movement rate. Actors can’t split their
Move action, such as taking part of it before using their
Main Action and the rest afterwards.
An actor who wants to disengage from an opponent in melee must use their Main Action to perform
a Fighting Withdrawal, or else they suffer a free automatic melee attack from any foe engaged with them.
There is no need to spend a Main Action disengaging
from enemies who are wielding only ranged weapons.
While it’s possible to use a rifle to buttstroke someone
or pistol-whip a near combatant, such weapons aren’t
as effectively threatening as true melee weapons.
On Turn Action

Any Amount on Your Turn

An On Turn action is some fast, simple act that could
reasonably be performed while an actor is doing something else. Dropping an object, falling prone, saying
something, drawing a Readied item, or activating a
simple device might all be On Turn actions. A PC can
perform as many On Turn actions as they want in a
round, subject to the GM’s discretion.
Instant Action

Any Amount, Any Time

An Instant action is special, in that it can be performed
even when it’s not the actor’s turn, or even after attacks or damage have already been rolled. Some psychic
powers are Instant actions, allowing the actor to use
them after they decide they don’t like how the dice have
fallen. Certain combat actions are also Instant, though
they often cost the actor’s Main Action for the round as
well. Any number of Instant actions can be performed
during a round.

COMBAT •49

Hitting an Enemy

When an actor wants to hurt a target, they need to use
their Main Action to make an attack roll. An attack roll
represents not just one shot or swing, but the assailant
spending their round trying to get in a good hit or a
clean shot at the target.
To make an attack roll, the assailant rolls 1d20 and
adds their attack bonus, their applicable skill level, and
the attribute modifier most relevant to the weapon.
If the total is equal or higher than the target’s Armor
Class, the attack is successful.
A PC’s attack bonus is usually equal to half their
character level, rounded down. Characters with the
Warrior class or an Adventurer with the Partial Warrior class option have higher base attack bonuses. NPCs
have their own attack bonus listed with their statistics,
which includes any modifiers they might have.
A PC’s skill level is their Punch, Stab, or Shoot
skill in most cases, depending on what kind of weapon
they’re using. In rare cases, a different skill might be
involved, such as Pilot for the guns of a light starfighter.
If a PC doesn’t even have level-0 expertise in the type
of weapon they’re using, they suffer a -2 penalty on hit
rolls for unfamiliarity with it.
A PC’s attribute modifier depends on the weapon.
For ranged weapons, this is usually Dexterity, while
smaller melee weapons might use Strength or Dexterity, and large ones might rely on Strength alone. If a
weapon has more than one attribute listed, use the best.

A successful attack inflicts hit point damage equal
to the weapon’s damage die plus the relevant attribute
modifier. Thus, a hero with a +1 Dexterity modifier
firing a laser pistol that does 1d6 damage would inflict
1d6+1 hit points of damage on a hit. Skill levels do not
add to damage unless it is a Punch attack.
Some melee weapons apply Shock, and are guaranteed to do some degree of harm to a target. A weapon’s
Shock quality lists the number of points of damage it
inflicts on any target with an Armor Class equal or
less than the one given. Thus, a primitive knife with a
Shock score of “1 point/AC 15” would always do at least
1 point of damage whenever its wielder attacks a target
with AC 15 or less, whether they hit or miss.
Shock damage always adds the wielder’s attribute
modifier and any other bonuses that might apply from
weapon mods, foci, or other advanced tech. Some advanced armor will always protect completely against
primitive weapons, however, and some advanced
weapons can ignore primitive gear, treating it as AC 10.
A successful attack doesn’t always mean a direct
physical hit. A flurry of strokes that force an enemy
off-balance, graze him, frighten him, or exhaust him
might all drain his hit points, bringing him closer to
defeat without actually inflicting real physical harm.
Only the last handful of hit points reflect serious bodily
damage. It’s up to the GM and player to decide how to
describe the effects of a successful hit.

Hit Roll Modifiers

Sometimes it can be easier or harder to connect with
a blow depending on the combat situation. The table
below offers some suggested hit roll modifiers for common combat circumstances.
Circumstance

Mod

Shooting at a distant prone foe

-2

Shooting or meleeing an adjacent prone foe

+2

Melee attacking while prone

-4

The target is at least half behind cover

-2

The target is almost completely in cover

-4

Shooting from a prepared firing position

+2

Finding cover is often critical in a gun battle. Generally, firing around a convenient corner or shooting
over sandbags would qualify as half cover, while firing through slits or from carefully-prepared bunkers
would allow for full cover. Melee attackers can usually
ignore cover, as they get too close for their target to
take proper advantage of it. Being prone doesn’t stack
with hard cover, but sometimes the available cover is
so low that the hero has to be flat to benefit from it.
A gunman who can set up a prepared firing position can get a significant advantage. Such a position
usually requires at least five minutes of sighting and setting up a rest. Most such positions provide some cover.

50• COMBAT

COMMON ACTIONS IN COMBAT
While a PC can do anything they might reasonably
accomplish in six seconds as their Main Action for a
round, some choices are more common than others.
Below are a list of some of the tactics or actions that
come up most often in combat.
Make a Melee Attack
Main Action
The combatant attacks an enemy within melee range,
rolling a normal hit roll and inflicting damage on a
successful hit. Most melee attacks inflict Shock damage
on a miss, if the target’s Armor Class is low enough, and
no successful hit does less damage than the weapon’s
Shock would have done on a miss. An attacker’s weapon must be Readied in order to attack with it.
Make a Ranged Attack
Main Action
The combatant fires or throws a Readied ranged weapon at a target. The combatant can’t Make a Ranged
Attack with a two-handed weapon if there’s a enemy
armed with a melee weapon within melee range; it’s
too easy for the assailant to bind up a rifle-sized gun.
One-handed ranged weapons and thrown weapons can
still be used, albeit at a -4 penalty to hit.
Make a Snap Attack
Instant Action
A combatant with a Ready weapon can rush their attack,
sacrificing accuracy for speed. The combatant must still
have their Main Action impending or available. As an
Instant, they can sacrifice it to Make a Melee Attack or
Make a Ranged Attack against a foe in range, whether a
snap shot with a pistol or a quick thrust at an adjacent
melee foe. This attack takes a -4 penalty to its hit roll.
If multiple combatants decide to make Snap Attacks at
the same time, they are resolved simultaneously.
Snap Attacks are usually made only by the desperate, the undisciplined, or the elite, and the GM should
rarely have NPCs employ them. Untrained hooligans
might blaze away in excitement or panic, or a gunman
being charged by a howling spearman might risk a shot
before he gets too close, but most combatants can’t afford to take such a heavy penalty to their hit roll. Truly
skilled combatants, however, can sometimes get away
with such risks, particularly if they have a Warrior’s
class ability to turn a miss into a hit.
Total Defense
Instant Action
As an Instant action, the combatant focuses on nothing
other than avoiding knives, gunfire, hurled crystalline
spears, or other perils in the vicinity. Using Total Defense costs the user their Main Action for the round,
and cannot be used if they’ve already employed their
Main Action. They become immune to Shock damage
for the round from melee weapons, regardless of their
Armor Class, and gain a +2 bonus to their Armor Class
until their next turn.

Club Up a Weapon
Move Action
A combatant can shift their grip on a Readied rifle or
pistol, using it as a crude melee weapon rather than a
ranged weapon. Rifle-sized guns used this way count
as a medium primitive weapon with no Shock score,
and pistol-sized guns count as a small primitive weapon with no Shock score. Rolling maximum damage on
a hit with such improvised weapons will break them.
This action can also be taken to unclub a weapon and
ready it to shoot.
Run
Move Action
The combatant moves their normal combat movement
rate, which is 10 meters for most humans. If they’re
climbing a surface, swimming, or navigating extremely
rough terrain, this movement rate is halved, and they
might have to make an Exert skill check to achieve even
that. Prone characters crab along at half this rate.
Fighting Withdrawal
Main Action
The combatant disengages from any melee foes around
them. They don’t actually move away, but they can now
get away from their assailants without giving them a
free melee attack. Usually, this means the combatant
uses their Move action to get clear, because if they just
stand there the enemies might choose to re-engage
them the next round.
Use a Skill
Main Action
The combatant uses a skill that could be plausibly applied in a few seconds. An Int/Heal or Dex/Heal skill
check to stabilize a wounded comrade is one such potential use, as is executing a pre-programmed hack,
shouting out a stirring rallying cry to timorous NPC
allies, or anything else that might be done quickly.
Ready or Stow an Item

Main Action

The combatant draws a weapon, extracts an item from
their backpack, digs a magazine out of a belt pouch,
or otherwise moves an object around on their person.
They can Ready an item this way or Stow it.
Reload a Weapon
Main Action
The combatant swaps a Readied power cell or magazine
into their weapon. Some very primitive firearms might
require more than one action to load them, while an
archer can nock another arrow as a Move action.
Drop an Item
Instant Action
The combatant drops something they’re holding. They
can do this Instantly at any time to free up their hands.

COMBAT •51

Pick up an Item

Move Action

The combatant can scoop an object off the floor if they
have a free hand, leaving it Readied in their grip.
Stand Up
Move Action
The combatant gets up from a prone position. Most
characters that have just been revived from unconsciousness must get up before they do much else.
Go Prone
On Turn Action
The combatant falls flat, forcing distant ranged attackers to take a -2 penalty to hit them. Adjacent enemies
find you an easier target, however, gaining +2 to hit.

Hold An Action

Move Action

By choosing to Hold An Action, the combatant can delay
taking the rest of their actions until later in the round,
activating them as an Instant action. Thus, a hero who
wins initiative might use their Move action to Hold An
Action. Later in the round, as an enemy rushes around
a corner, he may Instantly elect to use his Main Action
to Make A Ranged Attack with his readied laser rifle. If
acting in response to someone else’s impending action,
the held action is resolved first.

Examples of Murder
Yaddle and Bort, two drunken hive thugs, get involved in an impromptu knife fight over a card
game. Yaddle wins the initiative roll, but Bort elects
to make a Snap Attack, since Yaddle is within convenient range of Bort’s Readied knife. Incensed, Yaddle
also decides to make a Snap Attack, so the two resolve their attacks simultaneously.
Bort has a hit bonus of +1. Being an NPC, he
doesn’t add skills or attribute modifiers; he just rolls
1d20, adds 1 to it for his attack bonus, and applies a
-4 penalty for a Snap Attack to find the Armor Class
he hits. His modified roll is 11, which is enough to
hit the unarmored Yaddle, who has an AC of 10. Bort
rolls 1d4 for his small, primitive knife, inflicting 3
points of damage. Again, as an NPC, he doesn’t add
attribute modifiers to the damage.
Yaddle has a similar hit bonus, but his modified
roll is 7, less than Bort’s unarmored AC of 10, so he
misses. His primitive knife does do 1 point of Shock
damage to Bort, however, because a small primitive
weapon does its Shock damage to any target with an
AC of 15 or less.
With the attacks resolved simultaneously, both
now take damage. Yaddle takes 3 points, and as he
only had 3 hit points to begin with, he’s down and
dying, spurting from several vicious slashes. Bort
takes 1 damage from Shock, and since he was always
a frail gutter rat with only 1 hit point, he too is down,
slipping into shock from a gash in his belly. Luckily,
he owes an onlooker money, so his creditor rushes
forward and tries to hold Bort’s guts in with his coat.
Stabilizing a mortally wounded target requires
an Int/Heal or Dex/Heal skill check. The creditor
is an NPC, and the GM decides that they have no
particular talent at first aid, so the GM rolls a flat 2d6
for them and gets a lucky 10. That’s just enough to
stabilize Bort even without the help of proper medical supplies, and so the downed victor is carried off
to a an unlicensed street doc for emergency patching.

After a month of recovery, a cocky Bort has
equipped himself with a spiked walking stick, a medium primitive weapon that is “more bashy” than his
small knife. He spots the young PC Warrior gunslinger Eliza Darrick in the grimy hive street and
covets her fine revolver. What better way to acquire
it than to cosh the young woman?
He sidles into position near her before raising
his stick. Eliza has a considerable fund of common
sense and is not subject to surprise at this turn of
events, given the environment. Both roll initiative
and Bort wins. He makes his roll of 1d20+1, no longer rushed by a Snap Attack, and gets a 13.
Eliza has an armored undersuit that grants her
an AC of 13, plus a bonus of +1 for her Dexterity
modifier, for a total AC of 14. As Bort’s roll is lower,
he misses. Because medium primitive weapons only
do Shock to targets with AC of 13 or less, Bort’s stick
doesn’t even do Shock damage to her.
Eliza then draws the Readied revolver that Bort
so coveted and makes her own attack roll of 1d20, +1
for her attack bonus, +1 more for her Dexterity, and
+1 more for her Shoot-1 skill. She rolls a total of 4,
an abysmal showing. As she does not much care for
being jumped by the likes of Bort, she chooses to use
her Warrior class ability to turn a missed shot into a
hit once per scene, sealing Bort’s doom.
With only 1 hit point, it doesn’t even matter
what Eliza might roll for damage. The GM describes
the look of dull surprise on Bort’s face as Eliza’s bullet
plows a wet hole through his chest.
Eliza ducks down a side street as Bort falls to the
filthy asphalt. Even if the GM decided that Bort had
a chance to survive his wound, none of the denizens
around him have any interest in anything but the
contents of his pockets. Bort gurgles out the last of
his life six rounds later, giving fodder for bad dreams
to the scarred urchin who is tugging the stick from
his slackening grip.

52• COMBAT

COMBAT COMPLICATIONS AND MANEUVERS
Players generally seek to wring out every possible advantage in a combat, and that means they’ll often try
unusual maneuvers or add special complications to a
fight. The situations that follow are just some of the
more common circumstances a GM will encounter.

Forcing Enemy Movement

Sometimes the PC will want to shove an enemy into
a firepit, force a foe into an open reactor core spark,
dump an alien chamberpot on their head, or swing
from the balcony down upon an evildoer. Sometimes
these gambits will simply work, while other times a
skill check might be required.
To shove, herd, or otherwise manipulate a foe, the
attacker has to hit them with a Punch attack, doing
no damage, and then win an opposed Punch or Exert
skill check. If they win, the opponent gets moved up
to three meters in the direction the PC wishes or is
knocked prone. Herding a foe with a melee weapon
may also be possible at the GM’s discretion, allowing a
Stab skill check instead of Punch.
When environmental damage is needed for a firepit, dropped object, or inconvenient wall spike, 1d8 is
usually a good choice, with potential ongoing damage
if the victim doesn’t get out. Major foes can handle a
lot of such accidents, while ordinary men and women
might well be taken out of the fight by them.

Disarming a Foe

Wresting a weapon from a hostile wielder is a difficult
feat under the best of circumstances. Still, sometimes
a PC will want to strip their foe of something sharp
or shooty.
Normally it is only possible to disarm a foe when
engaging them in melee combat. Shooting the weapon
out of an enemy’s hand is a popular holovid trope, but it
tends to be less practical on the actual battlefield.
To execute a disarm, the assailant must choose to
spend their Main Action doing so and make a successful
attack roll. If they hit, they do no damage; instead, both
they and their targets make Dex or Strength-modified
skill checks with the weapons they’re using, with the
defender gaining a +3 bonus on the roll. If the attacker
wins the opposed check, the enemy is disarmed. On a
tie, both are disarmed.
Disarmed weapons skitter 1d4 meters away in a
random direction. If the attacker beats the defender by
at least three points on the opposed check, they end
up in control of the weapon if they have a free hand.
Thus, if a bare-handed assailant tried to rip the gun
out of the hands of an enemy alien, the assailant would
need to hit with a Punch attack and then roll either Str/
Punch or Dex/Punch against the alien’s skill check + 3.
If they won, they’d send the gun flying, and if they won
by 3 or more points, they’d end up holding it.

Execution Attacks

Occasionally an assailant will have the chance to perfectly set up a shot against an entirely unsuspecting target. Such surprise attacks can be devastatingly effective,
and are capable of summarily executing almost anyone.
Setting up a killing blow this way requires a full
minute of preparation, whether as a sniper drawing
a bead on a target or an assassin drifting closer to an
unsuspecting politico. Any focused attention on the
assailant will spoil this preparation, as will any action
that alarms the target. Assassins intending a melee attack must be using an adequately lethal weapon, such as
a knife rather than a fist or bludgeon. PCs with special
talents in unarmed combat or murderous blunt weapon
use might be exempt from this at the GM’s discretion.
Once the preparation is complete, a sniper may
shoot or an assassin may attack an adjacent target. The
target’s Armor Class is irrelevant, assuming the weapon being used isn’t too primitive to penetrate high-tech
armor. Hitting with a sniper shot is a Dex/Shoot skill
check, with a difficulty of 6 for a point-blank shot, 8 for
one at the weapon’s normal range, and 10 for a shot at
extreme range. A melee attack always hits, but the assassin must be adjacent to the target, and cannot move
to close on the same round. They must be adjacent and
unsuspected at the start of the round.
If the attack hits, it does maximum damage and
the victim must immediately make a Physical saving
throw at a penalty equal to the attacker’s combat skill
or they will be mortally wounded on the spot. Some
victims might merely be incapacitated instead if such
an outcome was intended and plausible.
Attacking a completely helpless adjacent opponent,
such as one who is unconscious, asleep, thoroughly
bound, or otherwise incapable of self-defense does not
require a hit roll and will leave them mortally wounded.
Player characters are as vulnerable to these rules as
NPCs are, and may be sniped or stabbed if they behave
in sufficiently incautious fashion.

Two-Weapon Fighting

Some players enjoy having their heroes employ two
weapons at once in combat, whether they’re a pair of
knives, a brace of laser pistols, or some other plausible
pairing of weapons.
Dual-wielding requires at least level-1 skill in
Shoot or Stab depending on the weapons used. Novices
cannot effectively dual-wield.
A hero who dual-wields suffers a -1 penalty on
hit rolls due to the extra complication, but gains a +2
bonus on damage rolls on a successful hit. This bonus
doesn’t add to Shock. Only one weapon can be used to
attack in any given round, though either can be used.
Unarmed combatants cannot dual-wield.

INJURY, DEATH, AND HEALING •53

INJURY, DEATH, AND HEALING
A creature brought to zero hit points has been defeated
and can no longer fight. If brought to zero hit points by
a lethal weapon, they are dead or dying. Foes brought
down with fists, blunt objects, or other less-than-lethal
means may merely be unconscious or incapacitated, if
their assailant wasn’t trying to kill them. Some enemies
might even be incapacitated by purely mental or emotional strain. Foes defeated non-lethally recover one
hit point after ten minutes and then function normally.
A mortally-wounded creature at zero hit points
will die in no more than six rounds. They may be unconscious, screaming for their mother, trying to press
vital organs back into place, or begging for mercy, but
they can perform no useful action and their fate is sealed
if no immediate aid is provided. Creatures dropped by
Heavy weapons, explosives, or other dramatic injury
may be instantly killed at the GM’s discretion. Additional damage inflicted on a mortally-wounded target
will always kill them immediately.
A PC who wants to extend mercy to an enemy or
aid to a friend can use their Main Action to attempt
an Int/Heal or Dex/Heal skill check, using whatever
modifier is best. If they have no special medical tools
available at all, the difficulty of the check is 10 plus
the number of rounds that have passed since the target
went down. If they have a medical kit or other proper
trauma tools, the difficulty is 8 plus the rounds since
injury, and if they expend a Lazarus patch on the target,
the difficulty is 6 plus the time. A failed check can be

re-attempted next round if the target isn’t dead yet, but
Lazarus patches are expended even on a failure. The
Biopsionic technique Psychic Succor automatically succeeds in stabilizing a target, if any time remains to them.
A critically-injured target who has been stabilized
regains one hit point after ten minutes of recovery.
They are able to move and function normally if they are
fiercely determined to do so, but any further damage
whatsoever will kill them, with no chance for stabilization. If they are healed with some high-tech pharmaceutical stim or advanced Biopsionic technique, they
can shake off this fragility and return to action with
whatever hit points the drug or power have provided.
Without such advanced healing, a critically-wounded
target requires at least a week of bed rest and medical
care before they can shake off their fragility and start
regaining their level in hit points after each night’s rest.
This assumes that TL4 medical care is available. If
only TL3 tech is on hand, the recovery time is a month.
If TL2 or lower medical care is provided, the recovery
time is a month, and the target must make a Physical
saving throw at the end of it, with a bonus equal to the
Heal skill of whoever is tending them. On a success,
they’ll recover within 1d4 more weeks. On a failure,
the primitive technology ensures they’ll die of their
wounds at some point in that time.
Creatures that have suffered damage but have not
been mortally injured regain hit points equal to their
hit dice or character level after each night of good rest.

Desperate Measures
Eliza Darrick is in a bad situation. During the exploration of a lost Mandate research station, an ally
managed to accidentally activate the installation’s
defense systems. A swarm of decaying security bots
almost overwhelmed the group, and a chance shot
from an integral mag rifle has just dropped Eliza.
The gunslinger is on the floor with zero hit
points. If she were an NPC, the shot probably would
have just killed her outright, but as a PC, she has
the hardihood to keep struggling against any wound
a human could theoretically survive. Even so, she’s
going to die in six rounds if nobody comes to her aid.
Big John, an ally of the downed shootist, spends
his Main Action dragging her behind cover as the
rest of the party tries to hold back the metal tide. By
the time he actually gets the chance to try to stabilize
her, a full round has passed since she was felled.
Luckily, Big John has a lazarus patch Readied at
his belt. Unluckily, he has no medical skill whatsoever, though he’s quite intelligent, with a +1 attribute
modifier. He rolls 2d6, -1 for his lack of Heal skill, +1
for his Intelligence modifier, for a total of 6.

Unfortunately, since Eliza has been bleeding out
for one full round, the difficulty of stabilizing her is
7. The patch fails. Big John has another one in his
pack, but it’s going to take him his next round’s Main
Action to dig it out and then another round to try to
apply it, by which time Eliza will have been bleeding
for three rounds and the difficulty will be 9.
The next round, a shout from across the room
alerts Big John that an ally is throwing him something. A stim unit comes skittering across the floor,
and Big John uses a Move action to scoop it up, leaving it Readied in his grip. It’s an ancient Mandate cosmetic stim they looted from the station’s commissary,
and it might just save Eliza’s life.
Big John presses the stim capsule against Eliza’s
neck and the mysterious pretech nanites do their
work, giving her minty-fresh breath for the next six
months. As a side effect, the medical substrate of the
Mandate stim also heals 1d6 damage to her, raising
her to five hit points. Eliza is now prone but fully
revived. Thanks to the advanced healing, she does
not need further rest before returning to action.

54• HACKING

HACKING
In the far future, it’s inevitable that many advanced civilizations will use computers to control their vehicles,
infrastructure, and data stores. It is equally inevitable
that some tech-talented hero will try to use that fact
to get something they want. While hacking has some
significant limitations in what it can accomplish, it can
still be a useful tool for the right kind of hero.

The Digital Environment

Most planets with TL4 or better will rely on computers
to operate their infrastructure and maintain their data.
They may or may not have an internet-like global network depending on their political situation and cultural
values, but individual buildings or data storehouses will
normally have an internal network. If there is no open
planetary internet, a hacker will need to be physically
present in the networked area to hack the system.
Most hacking requires a physical interface with
the system, either through tapping a data line with a
metatool or plugging into a connected terminal. Tapping a data line usually takes at least a minute unless a
special cable-siphon tool is used, while plugging into
a terminal is a Main Action. Some buildings may have
a local wireless network that can be used as an entry
point, and some planetary internets may allow assaults
on arbitrary computers, but such convenient situations
are unusual. Advanced security software usually makes
such remote assaults impractically difficult.
It’s up to the GM to decide what parts of a facility
are susceptible to hacking, and to determine the full
scope of what effects a hacker can produce. A hightech security door in some advanced facility might well
be hackable, but every refrigerator, locked closet door,
and employee bathroom is not necessarily slaved to the
local network.

Executing the Hack

Assuming a hacker is able to make a connection, they
can make an Int/Program skill check to hack the system.
If they’ve spent at least an hour planning this specific
hack, the skill check requires only a Main Action to
execute their prepared code. If they’re performing the
hack off-the-cuff, it takes ten minutes. If they’re rushed
and don’t have time to either prepare the hack or spend
ten minutes dueling with security systems, they can
speed it up into a single Main Action at an additional
difficulty penalty.
The difficulty of the roll depends on the kind of
information or influence they want to get out of the
system, adjusted by the quality of the security system
and any rush on the hacker’s part. On a success, they
get what they want. If what they want is data, the information is downloaded instantly. If what they want
is control over an automated system such as a factory
control computer or a security system, they maintain

control for 1d4 rounds plus their Program skill before
the system detects the intrusion and locks them out.
The hacker can attempt to regain control, but further
hacking attempts become more difficult.
If they fail, they must immediately make a second
skill check at the same difficulty. On a success, they
avoid an immediate alarm and a trace of their hacking
location. On a failure, the system has been alerted to
their intrusion attempt and has informed its human
overseers of the hacker’s location. Depending on the
nature of the system being hacked, the response may
range from an annoyed data janitor shutting down the
compromised terminal after he’s done eating lunch to
a fast-response special weapons team busting through
the windows ninety seconds later.
Hacking the same system in a short period of time
is progressively more difficult, as the system’s alerts and
security measures are increasingly active. Whether or
not prior attempts were successful, an additional +1
difficulty penalty is added for every hack attempted in
the system after the first within 24 hours.

Line Shunts

Some well-guarded or high-security computer systems
require more than a simple hack to obtain data or subvert their functionality. These systems have multiple
security redundancies and consensus-based backup
processors that make it all but impossible to execute a
hack from a single point. To overcome these systems
or to execute exceptionally long-lived hacks, the hacker
must place one or more line shunts at other locations.
A line shunt is a TL4 piece of black-market tech
designed to tap into a data line and spoof the contents
in concert with a hacking attempt.
Professional, well-maintained computer systems
usually require one line shunt to be applied before any
hack can be performed. Government or infotech-focused corporation buildings usually need two. Black
sites or extremely well-guarded systems need three.
Once a sufficient number of line shunts are applied, any ensuing hacks last until the shunts are disturbed. Thus, if a hacker placed the shunts and then
Subverted a System, their control would last as long as
the shunts remained in place. The likelihood of a shunt
being found will depend on how accessible the location
is, how active the guardians are, and how obvious the
hacking attempt is.
Line shunts must usually be placed at specific locations in a structure or building in order to tap the right
lines, depending on the goal of the hacker. If the hacker
doesn’t have a map of the site’s network architecture,
they can find the necessary sites with the Answer a Specific Question hack. This basic data probe doesn’t require
a line shunt, even if other hacks on the system would
need them to be placed.

HACKING •55

Data Protocols

It’s assumed that a competent PC with the Program
skill is familiar with the common data formats and
computing systems of their home sector. They will be
aware of the security measures and technical specifications of worlds that are in common contact with each
other. Sometimes, however, the hacker is faced with a
completely foreign system, or one built along unknown
alien lines. In these cases they will need to have the
data protocols for the system before they can make an
effective hacking attempt.
Assuming the protocols aren’t restricted information, the hacker can drop a few credits on local tech
manuals and practice for a month minus one week per
level of Program skill, down to a one-day minimum.
At the end of that period, they’ll master the protocols.
If manuals aren’t widely available, one option is to
find a local hacker willing to share their information.
The difficulty of this is up to the GM; it might require
nothing more than a Connect skill check, or it may require a full-fledged adventure to find someone willing
to stick their neck out for foreigners who are clearly
going to cause trouble with their newfound knowledge.
Prices range from 1,000 credits for worlds with restricted but not carefully-policed data, to prices of 10,000
and up for worlds with more draconian data controls.
Another option is to obtain a well-secured local
computer and simply experiment on it. Of course, local hardware with up-to-date security measures of a
breadth and sophistication sufficient to teach a hacker
is likely to be either very expensive on the black market
or require a “collection expedition” by the party.

Example Hacking Actions

These are some of the usual actions taken by a hacker.
A GM can extrapolate others as the situation requires.
Answer a Specific Question (Difficulty 8): Get a specific
fact or piece of information from the system. Find
a person’s home address, find a path to a desired
destination in a building, locate active security
cameras, pull criminal records on a person, or
some other direct query.
Get General Information (Difficulty 10): Pull all available information on a particular topic from the
system. Get a full map of a site, get all information
about security systems, pull a subject’s complete
personnel file from a corporate database, acquire
all files related to a secret project, or some other
exhaustive data dump on a single specific topic.
Complete Database Acquisition (Difficulty 12): Copy
an entire database to another computer or data
storage unit. A single database might be a corporation’s personnel records, the records of a
particular police precinct, the full database of a
complex technical project, a starship’s operations
record and system log, or another entire corpus of
data. The database must be entirely present in the
local system and any significant database requires
at least an hour to decrypt and download, thus
necessitating the use of at least one line shunt. The
hacker must either have an adequate data storage
unit, a landline connection to another computer
or a wireless connection to a remote server.
Suppress a System (Difficulty 8): Shut down a particular automated system connected to this network.
Cameras stop recording, sensors stop sensing,
open powered doors won’t close, and automated
gun turrets won’t fire. The hacker can affect several individual sensors or systems, but only of the
same type. Thus, they could shut down an electrified fence for the duration of the hack, but they’d
have to make a second hack to deactivate the cameras. When the hack ends, the system will resume
operation without registering the interruption.
Subvert a System (Difficulty 10): Much as suppressing
a system, except that the hacker can control its
operation within the device’s normal parameters.
They can upload fake input to a sensor system, fire
automated defenses, or open sealed vault doors.
The hacker can control the system each round by
using a Main Action to do so; if uncontrolled, the
system simply repeats or maintains its last state.
Sabotage a System (Difficulty 10): The hacker completely fries a specific system, either causing it to physically self-destruct or jamming it with malignant
code. Unlike most hacks performed without link
shunts, this damage is permanent until the owners
repair the broken hardware, a process that usually
requires several hours. Sabotage always triggers
immediate alerts to any human overseers.

56• ADVANCEMENT

CHARACTER ADVANCEMENT
When characters accumulate enough experience points,
they advance a character level. New PCs start out at level one and the most experienced, capable heroes in the
sector might reach level ten. Advancing beyond level
ten is usually prohibitively difficult, though possible at
the GM’s discretion.

Gaining Experience Points

To advance in capability, PCs need to earn experience
points. Once they accumulate enough experience, they
can advance to the next character level, representing
the sharpening of their skills and the heroic veterancy
that comes of surviving perils and dire challenges.
There are many different things that can earn a
hero experience points, and the kind of activities and
goals that reward them will vary with the kind of campaign you’re playing. The GM should make clear to the
whole group what kind of things earn the PCs experience in their game.
For some games, success might lie in plundering
alien hoards or clawing wealth from the hands of desperate patrons. Other games might reward the PCs
for achieving personal goals, whether or not there
was any money in it. Some might even award XP only
for spending credits, requiring every PC to recklessly
waste their wealth before gaining a level. It’s up to the
GM to pick a method that fits the group’s tastes.
The table below indicates how many experience
points need to be earned before a PC can advance to
that level. Once the requisite number of XP are earned,
the hero gains their new level and all the benefits.
Note that this table makes for a relatively fast
progression through the early levels of an adventurer’s career, before slowing drastically at higher levels.
A group that prefers a different pacing might alter the
chart to suit their own tastes.
In general, you can assume that one “successful”
gaming session should usually earn you about 3 XP.

Benefits of Gaining a Level

Once a PC has been awarded enough experience points
to reach the next level, they immediately gain the benefits of advancement. No special training or practice
is required as their abilities are assumed to have been
honed by their past adventures.

Roll Additional Hit Points

First, they become harder to overcome in combat. To
determine their new maximum hit points, they roll a
number of six-sided dice equal to their new level, adding their Constitution modifier to each one. A negative modifier can’t lower a die’s result below 1. If the
total is greater than their current hit points, they take
this new total. Otherwise, their current maximum hit
points increase by one.
Thus, if a character with a Constitution score of
14 and four hit points reached second level, they’d roll
2d6+2. If the total was five or greater, they’d keep it.
If they managed to roll snake eyes and get only a four,
they’d still increase their maximum hit points to five.
Warriors and Adventurers with the Partial Warrior class option get a further two hit points each time
they advance a level. Thus, a third level Warrior would
roll 3d6+6 for their hit point total, plus three times
their Constitution modifier.

Improve Attack Bonus

A PC’s base attack bonus becomes equal to half their
new character level, rounded down. Warriors may
instead use their full character level for the bonus. Adventurers with the Partial Warrior class option may
add a cumulative +1 to their attack bonus at levels one
and five, thus having a total +1 attack bonus at level
one and +4 at level five.

Improve Saving Throws

The PC becomes more capable of evading chance
harms and perils. Their saving throw scores decrease
by one, making it easier to succeed on saving throws
by rolling equal or over it. As a first level character has
saving throw scores of 15, reaching second level would
lower them to 14, modified by attributes.

ADVANCEMENT •57

Gain and Spend Skill Points

They become more capable with their skills. A PC gains
three skill points they can spend on improving their
skills or save to spend later. Experts and Adventurers
with the Partial Expert class option gain an extra bonus
point to spend on a non-combat, non-psychic skill.
If the PC is a Psychic or Partial Psychic, they must
spend at least one of these points on improving psychic
skills or gaining new psychic techniques. They can save
these points to spend later if they wish, but they cannot
spend them on more mundane talents. Restricted psychics can only ever improve or learn techniques from
the psychic discipline they selected when they picked
the Psychic primary focus. Unrestricted psychics can
improve or learn any discipline. PCs with the Psychic
character class are all unrestricted, while Partial Psychic
Adventurers are restricted in their talents.
Skills that are gained or improved immediately on
gaining a level are assumed to have been perfected over
the past level and require no training time or teaching.
If you save your skill points to spend them later then
you’ll need to find some teacher or other explanation
for developing them. It doesn’t take more than a week
to refine your new ability, but you can’t usually spend
your points mid-scene to develop a heretofore-unmentioned expertise with flamethrowers.
The cost for improving a skill is listed below. Every skill level must be purchased in order; to gain level-1 in a skill you need to pay one point for level-0 and
then two points for level-1. A PC must be the requisite minimum level to increase a skill to certain levels.
Less hardened heroes simply don’t have the focus and
real-life experience to attain such a pitch of mastery.
A PC cannot develop skills beyond level-4.

Psychic Effort and Techniques

When a Psychic gains a new level in a psychic skill, they
can immediately pick a technique from that discipline
of equal or lesser level. They can’t save this pick; they
must choose it as soon as they gain the new skill level.
Psychics can also spend their skill points to master
additional psychic techniques. The cost of this education is equal to the technique’s minimum skill level requirement. Thus, to master the Biopsionic technique
Metamorph would cost three skill points, because Metamorph requires Biopsionics-3 skill to learn.
A Psychic’s maximum Effort is equal to 1 plus their
highest psychic skill, plus the best of their Wisdom or
Constitution modifiers.

Purchase Improved Attributes

A veteran adventurer may have trained or honed their
natural abilities well enough to improve one of their
six base attributes. While even the most determined
development isn’t enough to turn complete ineptitude
into gifted competence, a hard-working adventurer can
hone their existing strengths considerably.
The first time a PC improves an attribute, it costs
1 skill point and adds +1 to an attribute of their choice.
The second improvement to their attributes costs 2
skill points, the third 3, and so forth. Each improvement adds +1 to the attribute, potentially improving
its modifier.
PCs must be a certain level before purchasing the
third, fourth, or fifth attribute boost. No more than five
attribute boosts can ever be purchased by a PC.

Choose New Foci

Finally, the PC might be eligible to pick an additional
level in a focus. At levels 2, 5, 7, and 10 a PC can add
a level to an existing focus or pick up the first level in
a new focus.
If this is the first level they’ve taken in the focus,
they might be granted a skill as a free bonus pick, depending on the focus’ benefits. During character creation, this bonus skill pick is treated like any other skill
pick. If the focus is taken as part of advancement, however, it instead counts as three skill points spent toward
increasing the skill. This is enough to raise a nonexistent skill to level-1, or boost a level-1 skill to level-2.
They may do this even if they aren’t high-enough level
to normally qualify for a skill level that high.
If the skill points aren’t quite enough to raise the
skill to a new level, they remain as credit toward future
advances. If applied to a skill that is already at level-4,
the PC can spend the three skill points on any other
skill of their choice.

58• ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS

ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS
Falling

PCs who plunge off elevated surfaces suffer 1d6 damage
for every three full meters fallen under standard-gravity conditions.

Poisons

Those afflicted with some insidious venom can usually
make a Physical saving throw to resist the worst of the
effects. Natural venoms usually require 1d6 rounds to
apply their effect, while special or engineered toxins
take effect instantly. Poison effects may include unconsciousness, hit point damage, hallucinations, or death.
Even in the latter case, however, swift application
of the appropriate Biopsionic techniques or success at
an Int/Heal check can negate the effect of the poison.
The difficulty for this check varies with the potency of
the poison and assumes that the PC medic has access
to a TL4 medkit. Most natural poisons are difficulty
8, while synthetic toxins are difficulty 10 or greater.
Only one attempt can be made to neutralize a poison.
Use of a specific antivenin is always successful if such
a resource is available.
Drugged or damaged PCs are instantly restored by
successful treatment. Those who have been killed by a
poison revive with one hit point as if recovering from a
mortal wound, assuming the antidote is applied within
six rounds of the victim’s succumbing.

Diseases

Hideous interstellar plagues are an occupational hazard
of adventurers, though exposure to a pathogen usually
permits a Physical saving throw to resist its effects. If
failed, the PC is infected, and will suffer progressively-worse symptoms until the disease runs its course or
the PC dies.
Most sicknesses will simply apply penalties to
skill checks or hit rolls, or reduce a PC’s maximum hit
points, or otherwise debilitate the character. A few may
require one or more additional saving throws to be
made at specific intervals in order to avoid eventual
death, or be a certain doom to those unlucky enough
to be afflicted with it.
As with poisons, Biopsionic techniques or Int/Heal
medical attention can cure a sickness. Assuming TL4
medical supplies, ordinary diseases are usually difficulty
8, while more virulent strains are difficulty 10 or more.
One attempt can be made to cure a disease per week,
and success usually clears up any symptoms rapidly.

Radiation

Radiation is a slow killer in small doses, and a quick end
in larger ones. Targets exposed to dangerous amounts
of radiation must make a Physical saving throw at intervals depending on the strength of the glow. Mildly
dangerous zones might force a save once per day or
once per hour, up to lethal rad zones that force multiple saves per round. Vacc suits and other forms of
protection can effectively shield a wearer from weaker
sources of radiation.
Each failed saving throw lowers the target’s Constitution score by one point. If the new score decreases a hero’s Constitution modifier, they lose any excess
maximum hit points their former modifier granted.
Characters reduced below half their original Constitution score will die in 1d6 weeks from radiation poisoning; those reduced below a Constitution score of 3
will die instantly. Radiation poisoning that does not
immediately kill a victim can induce vomiting, headaches, soft tissue bleeding and dizziness, but a resolute
victim can continue functioning more-or-less normally
until death. A target killed by radiation poisoning cannot be revived by Psychic Succor or other stabilization
techniques.
Someone who has suffered a fatal dose of radiation
poisoning can only be saved by treatment at a TL4 hospital or ship’s sick bay, recovering the lost Constitution
at a rate of one point per week. Non-fatal doses can
be treated by a TL4 medkit and an Int/Heal check at
difficulty 10. Each success restores one lost point of
Constitution and a check can be made once per day.

Hard Vacuum

PCs sometimes encounter the icy void of space more
intimately than they would prefer. Actual death from
vacuum exposure may take a little while, but incapacitation is rapid for most victims. A PC exposed to hard
vacuum may continue acting normally for a number of
rounds equal to one plus their Constitution modifier.
Each round thereafter, they suffer 1d20 damage and
must make a Physical save to keep conscious, assuming
the damage hasn’t felled them.

SYSTEM QUICK REFERENCE SHEET
Skill Checks

Roll 2d6 and add the character’s most relevant attribute modifier and skill. Sometimes more than one skill might apply; the
PC can choose which to roll. If the roll is equal or higher than
the check difficulty, the PC succeeds. If less, then they either fail
outright, attain only partial success, or suffer an unanticipated
turn of events at the GM’s discretion.
For opposed skill checks, both participants roll and the
higher roll wins. For NPCs, assume they have a +0 bonus unless
the activity is one they’d reasonably be good at. In that case, they
can apply their listed skill bonus to the check.

Skill Check Difficulties
A relatively simple task that is still more than the PC
would usually be expected to manage in their regular
background. Anything easier than this isn’t worth a
skill check.
A significant challenge to a competent professional
that they’d still succeed at more often than not.
Something too difficult to be expected of anyone but
a skilled expert, and even they might fail.
Only a true master could expect to carry this off with
any degree of reliability.
Only a true master has any chance of achieving this at
all, and even they will probably fail.

Saving Throws

To make a saving throw, a victim rolls 1d20 and tries to equal
or exceed their relevant saving throw score. Target Physical
saves for poisons, diseases, and exhaustion, Evasion saves for
diving for cover or leaping back from peril, and Mental saves
for resisting psychic powers. NPCs have a saving throw score
of 15 minus half their hit dice, rounded down.

Injury and Healing

A target reduced to zero hit points by a lethal attack is mortally
wounded. One dropped by non-lethal assaults is unconscious.
Dying victims can take no actions and will die soon without help. Allies can attempt an Int/Heal or Dex/Heal skill check
as a Main Action to stabilize the victim. With no medical tools,
the difficulty is 10 plus the rounds since they went down. With
a medkit, it’s difficulty 8 plus the time, and using a Lazarus patch
makes it difficulty 6 plus the time. Failed checks can be attempted again, but a victim will die after the sixth round.
Stabilized characters regain 1 hit point after ten minutes
and can act normally, but any further damage kills them instantly. This fragility ends after they regain more hit points, either
through rest, stims, or biopsionic healing.
Stabilized PCs take at least a week to start recovering hit
points normally. Those who have merely been hurt but not
mortally wounded regain their level in lost hit points after every
night’s peaceful rest.

The Combat Sequence

Combat is divided into rounds of six seconds. Every participant
gets a turn, and then the sequence starts over again.
First, every participant rolls initiative, rolling 1d8 plus
their Dexterity modifier, if they have one. Participants act in
order, highest to lowest, with PCs winning ties with NPCs.
On their turn, a combatant can take one Main Action, one
Move, and as many On Turn actions as is plausible. A combatant can take Instant actions at any time, even when it’s not their
turn, or even if dice have already been rolled.

Acting In Combat

You can use a Main Action to attack an enemy, disengage from
a melee, use a skill, reload a gun, produce a Stowed item, take a
second Move action, or do anything else you could accomplish
in six seconds.
You can use a Move action to stand up from prone, club
up a ranged weapon, or move 10 meters. Your movement is
half that if you’re climbing, swimming, or otherwise navigating
rough terrain. You can’t split a Move action around your Main
Action. You have to move all at once. If you move away from a
melee combatant without spending a Main Action to disengage
from the fray, all adjacent melee attackers get a free attack at you.
You can use an On Turn action to fall prone, say something,
drop an object, or do anything else that’s very simple to do and
takes almost no time or attention.
You can use an Instant action at any time to trigger certain
special powers. You can also use it to make a Snap Attack with
a weapon or go totally defensive, though both of the latter will
cost you your Main Action for the round, and can’t be done if
you’ve already used your Main Action.

Hitting in Combat

To hit a target, the attacker rolls 1d20 and adds their attack
bonus, the relevant combat skill, and the attribute modifier
relevant to their weapon. Weapons with more than one listed
attribute allow the PC to use either. If the PC lacks the relevant
combat skill entirely, they take a -2 penalty to hit. If the roll is
equal or greater than the target’s Armor Class, the attack is a hit.
On a hit, the attacker rolls the weapon’s damage and adds
their relevant attribute modifier. The target takes that many
hit points of damage.
On a miss, a weapon that inflicts Shock damage might still
hurt the target. If the weapon’s Shock can harm the target’s
Armor Class, the target takes the weapon’s Shock damage even
on a miss. This damage is increased by the wielder’s relevant
attribute modifier and any other damage bonuses. A weapon
never does less damage than its Shock would do on a miss.

Morale in Combat

To make a morale check, NPCs roll 2d6. If equal or less than
their morale score, they keep fighting. Otherwise, they flee,
withdraw, or surrender. NPCs check morale after their first
casualty and after half are down. PCs never check morale.
