MECHS
Hulking figures of ceraplast, reinforced plating, and
all-important quantum tap arrays, mechs were some
of the most imposing war machines of the Second
Wave of human expansion. While few worlds retain
the economic base to build and support these titans of
war, some can still be found in long-abandoned Mandate military bases or in the armies of worlds that have
jealously preserved the secrets of their construction.

Born in Fire

At the beginning of the Second Wave of human colonization the warfare on advanced worlds had become
almost exclusively a matter of standoff engagements.
Microdrones, sat-missiles, and guided ordnance of
every variety made the battlefield a living hell for
those luckless infantry who were forced to face a wellequipped enemy. Attackers could engage at trans-continental range with very little chance of their missiles
and drones being brought down, as their command
channel encryption was simply too good and their
ECCM too strong for defensive jammers to defeat. All
the advantages were with the offense.
It wasn’t until 2348 and the escape of the rogue AI
Draco that this deadlock was broken. The quantum tap
techniques that Draco had used to translate his matrix
core data into a nearby warship could be repurposed
to other uses. Instead of attempting to defeat a hostile
projectile’s guidance cryptography, a jammer could
reach into the device’s electronic brain to scramble the
contents with a blast of random static.
Most computing devices were not overly susceptible to quantum tap disruption. Onboard error-checking solved out the static quickly and ordinary operation followed. For the split-second timing required by
guided weaponry, however, those few milliseconds of
confusion were lethal.
The ECM created by a quantum tap array was devastating. Even the most sophisticated error-correction
protocols could not scrub the static before the sat-missile or microdrone was hopelessly off course. The taps
could not usually control the data they inserted into
hostile systems, but it was not necessary to be precise
when raw noise sufficed to blind their targets.
The results of quantum tap ECM revolutionized
naval warfare. Ships were now able to mount defensive systems that effortlessly negated all but the fastest,
best-shielded projectiles. Space combat was forced into
knife-fighting range, with ships blasting each other
with direct-fire energy beams and brute Newtonian
mass weapons that had no guidance to scramble.
Today, remote drones and guided munitions are
of limited use in space combat. Every ship from the
humblest far trader on up has quantum ECM woven
into its basic comm infrastructure, and defeating it is
prohibitively difficult for modern TL4 tech.

Made In His Image

While quantum tap technology was an easy fit for
starships, developing a mobile ground version was
much more difficult. The tap required several emitters kept at appropriate distances from each other to
avoid cross-interference. Furthermore, the taps had to
be several meters above the planetary surface if they
were to avoid confusing backscatter.
Military designers struggled with the complex set
of requirements for a ground-based quantum tap array. Some mounted tall emitters on standard armored
vehicles, with long alloy spars jutting out to either side
to ensure the minimal distance. Others attempted to
build aerostat emitters, individual units that would
hover in the correct interference patterns. All of these
plans foundered on one or another technical difficulty.
It wasn’t until 2405 that a researcher finally entertained the idea of a humanoid walker as a platform
for a tap array. Mounting the emitters in the walker’s
“forearms” and “neck” would maintain a reasonably efficient spatial configuration, and would lift the emitters high enough to avoid terrestrial backscatter. The
walker itself would be a powerful computing platform
and generator mount to support the ECM generated
by the emitters, and the armor would give the taps a
better chance of surviving the battlefield.
There were numerous technical issues with putting a humanoid walker onto a battlefield, but none
of them were insurmountable. Integral grav planes
helped to stabilize and support the walker even on soft
or uneven terrain, and much of the technology that had
been developed for AI armatures could be scaled up to
provide the basic lines of a “mech”, as they were called.
By maintaining a roughly humanoid shape for the
mech, a human pilot could employ standard pretech
neural interface technology to control the machine as
a natural extension of his or her own body. The additional stability of a treaded or grav-sled base just wasn’t
enough to outweigh the assimilation advantage of actually giving the mech a humanoid pair of legs.
From that point on, mechs became a familiar sight
on human battlefields. While they were far more expensive than an equivalent weight of gravtanks or other
conventional war machines, they could shelter kilometers worth of terrain from the attentions of guided
projectiles and remote drones. As their importance
became clear, the need to defend them from attackers
prompted new developments in weapon and defensive
system mountings.
Still, the vast expense of building and maintaining
a mech force discouraged their use as the main body of
a Second Wave army. Gravtanks, armored personnel
carriers, and platoons of assault-suited infantry were
still far more flexible and economical to deploy in bulk.

MECHS •301

Refinement and Decay

As with any military device, mech development rapidly
specialized into several different forms and designs, all
calibrated to different purposes on the battlefield. Even
the enigmatic researchers of the Psionic Authority became involved in their development.
There were three major types of mech hulls: shock,
specialist, and psimech hulls. Shock mechs were designed for direct assault on hardened fortifications or
for anti-mech combat. Specialist hulls were optimized
for particular battlefield duties, especially defensive
measures and high-mobility recon. Psimech hulls were
the rarest of the three varieties, ancient pretech hulls
intended to amplify the abilities of a psychic pilot for
battlefield use.
Aside from type, mechs also were classified by hull
classes. The smallest mechs were “suits”, little more
than armored exoskeletons roughly three meters tall.
Suits were intended to support the small teams of elite
shock troopers who made up the tip of an attacking
force’s spear. The armor and equipment loadouts on
suits were very light compared to their larger brethren,
but they greatly enhanced a soldier’s survivability in the
face of heavy fire. Most suits were too small to mount
quantum tap arrays.

One step larger than suits were light mechs, most
of which were six to eight meters tall. Light mechs
were naturally among the most maneuverable and agile of the mech classes, while still being large enough
to support the fusion cores necessary for antigrav fins
or heavy weaponry. Light mechs could equip surprisingly vicious weapon loadouts, as so little power was
required to move the hull.
Heavy mechs were the titans of the battlefield, ten
to thirteen meters tall. This bulk is a significant drain
on fusion cores, and most heavy mechs were wired
to provide sudden large surges of power to hungry
fittings. Heavy mechs could mount the widest range
of defensive equipment and bear the thickest armor,
keeping them standing when smaller hulls would fail.
Despite this elaborate development, mech deployment became more and more uncommon in the latter
years of the Second Wave. They were an expensive
solution to a minor problem on the frontier, where
brushfire wars and guerrilla insurgencies rarely had the
vast stores of guided munitions that had scourged the
older battlefields of the core worlds. For the price of a
single heavy shock mech and a few months of its maintenance, a commander could acquire four gravtanks
and their vortex cannon armaments, or scores of Nemesis expert-system warbots. Without the ever-present
threat of unstoppable remote bombardment, the mechs
were a remedy to a problem that no longer existed.
Gradually, inevitably, mechs faded from the petty
battlefields and ambushes of the frontier. They stood
silent in sealed Mandate bases or in the armories of
border warlords, too expensive to run save on occasions of dire necessity. Their pilots were left to become
gravtank drivers or flyer jockeys, or just to keep fighting until some dumb-fire rocket got a lucky hit.
In the chaos of the Scream and the Silence that followed, most of the known mech caches were plundered
for spare parts. Others were raised for a last ride to
damnation as their owners spent them extravagantly
to seize disordered worlds. Few were left operational
forty years after the disaster, and on even fewer worlds
did sufficient industry remain to rebuild or repair them.
Those mechs that do remain are often units recovered from a long-lost Mandate cache or deep-space
supply depot. A few worlds still have the tech sufficient
to build them, and a logistical pipe somehow too limited to allow for mass movement of troops or armor.
These worlds are rare, and it is more often that surviving mechs are simply used as the shock troopers for a
larger army of more conventional weaponry.
But still, here and there among the scattered
worlds of mankind, mechs can still be found rising unexpectedly to meet their foes. For all their lost purpose,
they remain matchless at their intended role. They are
echoes of another time, tools meant for precise and
ancient purposes that no longer exist in a coarser age.
They are iron ghosts from a different age, and they
whisper of ambitions that modern rulers scarce recall.

302• MECHS

Mech Combat

Combat involving mechs operates in much the same
way as any other form of combat. Mechs have weapons,
an armor class based on their durability and size, and
hit points to reflect their physical condition. Combat
largely works just as it does at human or starship scales,
with a few adjustments.
Mechs have Armor ratings in the same way that
other vehicles do, and suit-class mechs use it the same
way. The Armor score is subtracted from the damage
done by each attack that hits, except for damage done
by explosives or TL4 Heavy weapons or that done by
other massive tools of violent disassembly. Light and
heavy mechs are even more durable, and are immune
to ordinary small arms, subtracting their Armor rating
from the damage done by Heavy weapons.
Mechs also have Speed ratings which are used just
as described in the Vehicles section of the equipment
chapter, with Pilot as the relevant skill for checks. For
situations when it is important to determine a mech’s
movement rating in meters, multiply suit speed by 10
meters and light and heavy mech speed by 20 meters to
find their rate of movement for one round.
A mech’s pilot can fire all of the guns mounted on
a mech each turn, and may fire them at different targets within range. Targets must all be selected before
the attacks begin, however, and cannot be altered that
round. If all guns are trained on an enemy who’s taken
out with the first lucky shot, the remaining attacks are
wasted. Suit pilots can fire personal weapons if they
choose, but they cannot fire both their own sidearms
and their suit’s equipment in the same round.
Most mechs have substantial internal ammunition
magazines, but the amount is not unlimited. A single
attack roll might represent several seconds of full-auto
gunfire. After each fight in which an ammunition-using weapon is fired, the pilot must make a Shoot skill
check modified by Wisdom against difficulty 6. On a
success, he fired judiciously and still has ammunition
remaining. On a failure, he has run out of ammo for
that gun. The difficulty of the check increases by 1 after
each fight. Ammunition magazines are fully refreshed
as part of each mech’s maintenance cycle. Energy weapons, melee weaponry, and psitech guns never run out
of ammunition.
The integral quantum ECM tap arrays mounted on
light and heavy mechs negate almost all indirect guided
ordnance within line of sight of the mech, defeating
incoming projectiles up to ten or twenty kilometers
away, depending on conditions. As a general rule, on
a battlefield with mechs, an attacker needs to be able
to see a target to hit it. Alternately, dumb fire rockets
or heavy artillery can be used to bombard a mech force,
as these munitions have no guidance systems to scramble. This ECM is not relevant in defending against the
weapons listed in this section, but it can make an enormous difference on a battlefield contested by advanced
military forces.

Mechs, Psionics, and Abilities

Mechs are treated as extensions of the wearer for the
purpose of special abilities. Warriors can use their class
ability to avoid or ensure a hit while piloting one, and
psionic abilities that apply effects to an ally or enemy
usually apply to their mech as well if such an effect is
reasonable. The precognitive benefits of Destiny’s Shield
can plausibly aid a mech pilot, for example, but none of
the biopsionic powers could mend scorched metal and
broken composites. Mechs are not valid targets for the
Synthetic Adaptation biopsionic technique.
Psychics with the Teleportation discipline can
teleport their mech at no additional weight cost if it is
a psimech. Teleporters with level Teleportation-2 or
greater skill in the discipline can manage to shift the
weight of a suit even if it isn’t a psimech variant. Light
and heavy mechs of the shock or specialist variety are
too heavy for any teleporter to move.

Mech Damage and Repair

Mechs take damage normally, but leave their pilot unharmed until they are finally destroyed. In most cases,
the enormous energies being thrown around a modern
battlefield make the wearer’s hit points largely irrelevant. For small mech suits, however, the individual
toughness and stamina of the pilot can make a difference. When a suit-class mech is damaged by an attack,
the pilot may choose to take the entire hit off their own
hit points, to represent their gradual loss of stamina,
focus, and luck.
Mechs are fully functional until their last hit points
are destroyed. Once reduced to zero hit points, the hull
is inoperable and the pilot is exposed to the outside
atmosphere. In hostile environments, most pilots wear
vacc suits against this unfortunate possibility.
The pilot of a mech reduced to zero hit points must
also make a Physical save; on a success, they escape
the hull with one-quarter of their current hit points,
rounded up. On a failure, they are mortally wounded and will require swift application of biopsionics or
lazarus patches if they are to survive.
Repairing one hit point’s worth of damage on a
suit costs 500 credits. The same repair on a light or
heavy mech costs 1,000 credits worth of materials. A
single tech can repair a number of hull points of damage equal to their Fix skill plus one for each hour of
work. Suits can be repaired with no more than the
necessary spare parts and a portable toolkit, but light
and heavy mechs require more sophisticated repair facilities. Remote repair vehicles and heavy haulers are
standard support elements for most mech units.
Mechs can resist any normal extreme of environment, from hard vacuum to a planetary atmosphere
of poisonous vapors. Any environment harsh enough
to damage a vehicle will apply the same penalties to a
mech. Mech suits are equipped with three days of food,
water, and atmosphere, while light and heavy mechs
can support their occupants for up to a week.

MECHS •303

Manipulation and Smashing

Mechs are remarkably agile machines, and can perform
any act of physical dexterity possible for a normal human being. All suits and most larger hulls are equipped
with “hands” of some sort for manipulating objects,
usually waldoed to even finer manipulators that can
handle and utilize human-scale objects. Integral stability gravs in all mechs allow them to move over any
surface that can support their weight. Suit hulls can
operate without major difficulty inside most buildings,
but light and heavy mechs are usually forced to remain
on roadways or solid ground if they lack grav flight.
Mech hulls are extremely strong. A suit can normally tear a suit-sized hole in a standard postech exterior wall with four rounds of effort, while a light mech
can smash a hole big enough for it to pass through in
only two rounds. Heavy mechs crush barriers with terrible ease, smashing huge holes in an obstruction with
just a single round of effort. Lighter or more primitive
construction gives way in half the time, while fortified
armorplast barriers may require 1d6 times as many
rounds, or be completely impervious.
If raw lifting weight becomes relevant, suits can
lift and carry one metric ton, light mechs can manage
five tons, and heavy mechs can manage twenty tons.
More than this might be theoretically possible for a hull,
but it taxes the grav stabilizers too badly, and will almost always end up toppling the mech or “fenceposting”
it thigh-deep into the softer soil beneath it.
Skill rolls made in a mech suit are treated as normal skill checks, with Pilot being the relevant skill.

Maintenance

The fusion cores that power the hulls require no refueling, but the engines, servos, magazines, electronics,
and fittings all need regular maintenance and refitting
in order to remain functional. Mechs can operate up
to 24 hours before maintenance is required. For each
further two hours of operation, a cumulative -1 penalty is applied to all hit rolls and skill checks with the
mech. When the penalty hits -10, the mech shuts down.
“Parked” mechs don’t count as being in active use.
Maintenance for a hull requires the same tools and
facilities as does repair. In one hour, a single tech can
maintain a number of heavy mechs equal to their Fix
skill rating plus one. They can maintain twice as many
light mechs and four times as many suits. A maintenance cycle for a suit requires spare parts and ammunition costing 500 credits, while one for a light mech
costs 1,000 and a heavy costs 2,000.
Keeping a mech force in the field is expensive.
Most commanders prefer to run a maintenance cycle
daily, though some resource-strapped leaders minimize
the active use of their mechs and try to stretch out the
periods between upkeep. These frugal ways can come
back to haunt a detachment when they’re suddenly
pressed by enemies who have no intention of giving
them the time they require to refit their mechs.

Piloting Mechs

Mech control systems rely on contact-free neural scanning and imaging technology combined with induced
somatic feedback projectors. No special harness is required, and any armor with an encumbrance value of 1
or less can be worn by a pilot without interfering with
the mech’s operation. There is almost never any kind
of key or lockout on a combat mech; the security of the
mech is usually based on it being located in the middle
of a high-tech military base, and not on possession of
a keycard or passcode. A few hours of basic training
will allow anyone to operate a mech, though elaborate maneuvers may be impossible for those without at
least Pilot-0 skill. Most somatic controls are sufficiently
flexible to handle human, alien, VI, or True AI pilots.
Interfacing with a mech requires 1d6 rounds, minus the pilot’s Pilot skill. Climbing into a light or heavy
mech cockpit usually takes an additional round, as does
donning a suit.
There is normally room inside a mech to transport the wearer’s readied and stowed equipment. Even
a suit-class mech can carry a hundred kilos of additional
gear without slowing down, and light and heavy mechs
can cart around tons worth of cargo. Such loads tend
to be highly vulnerable to enemy fire, as they’re often
protected by nothing thicker than a width of cargo netting. In most cases, it won’t be important for the GM
to worry about encumbrance for mech pilots. If the
mech is blown up and the pilot survives, he escapes
with his usual gear while anything strapped to the mech
is destroyed.

Twisting Metal
Mechs are extremely difficult to damage. Even
a light mech is armored with advanced pretech
composites and active defenses sufficient to shrug
off all but the most advanced or brutal weaponry.
By default, only TL4 Heavy weapons can
harm a light or heavy mech. Old-fashioned RPGs
or machine guns just can’t muster the necessary
force to crack the iron shells of these engines.
In some cases, however, TL3 hardware is sufficient to harm a mech. Heavy shaped charges can
damage a mech, as can direct hits by howitzers or
other field artillery. Such attacks will still have to
contend with the mech’s Armor rating, but they
could at least theoretically bring down the beast.
Other forces simply upgrade existing TL3
tech into TL4 equivalents. These weapons have
the same combat statistics as their more primitive
brethren, but they’re equipped with the advanced
explosive charges or augmented ammunition that
can hurt a modern mech. PCs who want to get
their hands on these upgraded machine guns and
rocket launchers can usually find them on any TL4
world with an active arms trading industry.

304• DESIGNING MECHS

DESIGNING MECHS
Mech hulls are defined by many of the same traits possessed by a starship, with a few adjustments made for
the unique nature of these engines of war.
Maintenance must be performed on a mech after
every 24 hours of operation. For every further two
hours or fraction thereof, the mech suffers a cumulative -1 on all hit rolls and skill checks. This entry gives
the cost in spare parts and consumables for performing
a maintenance pass on a given hull. In one hour, a single tech can service a number of heavy mechs equal to
their relevant Fix skill plus one. Twice as many light
mechs and four times as many suits may be services in
the same time. Suits can be serviced with little more
than the spares and a portable toolkit, but light and
heavy mechs require support vehicles with work cranes
and more extensive tool selections.
Armor functions in the same way as starship armor
for most mechs, rendering them immune to damage
from anything smaller than TL4 Heavy weapons, and
subtracting from any incoming damage. Suit mechs are
an exception, being much smaller and comparatively
more fragile. Their armor subtracts from the damage
done by small arms, but Heavy weapons ignore it
Hit Points are lost as normal to attacks that damage the mech. Once the mech reaches zero hit points,
the pilot must make a Physical saving throw; on a success, they escape the mech with one-quarter of their
current hit points, rounded up. On a failure, they are
mortally wounded. Pilots of suit-class mechs may opt
to take the full damage of an attack off their own hit
points after the dice are rolled, reflecting a strike that
rattles or exhausts the pilot without doing significant
damage to the hull itself.
Speed, Armor Class, Power, Free Mass, and
Hardpoints all function for mechs just as they do for
starships. Fittings, weapons, and defenses are all added
to the base hull up to the maximum load permitted by
a hull’s free mass and power.

Building a Mech

First, choose a hull class, either a suit, light, or heavy
mech. Then determine whether it will be a heavily-armored shock model, a fast and versatile specialist model,
or one of the rare psimech types designed for psionic
pilots. Any type may be piloted by any character, but
non-psychics cannot effectively use psi fittings.
Select appropriate fittings from the table in this
section. Each fitting has a cost in free mass and power,
and the total requirements of all fittings, weapons, and
defenses cannot exceed the suit’s rated power and mass.
Some fittings also have a minimum hull size, and cannot be mounted on smaller mechs. Psitech fittings can
only be mounted on psimechs.
Mech fittings can only be installed once for any
particular system, unless noted otherwise. Mech fittings usually require a particular minimum hull class
for installation, with suit-class hulls being unable to
mount Skywatch Drones or Comm Interceptors. Psi-based
fittings can be mounted only on psimechs and can be
used only by psionic pilots.
Select the desired weaponry and special defenses
for the mech, taking into account their free mass and
power costs. Weapons also take up one or more hardpoints, and a mech is limited in the number of available
hardpoints for a given model. A mech may be equipped
with as many weapons as it has hardpoints, power, and
mass to support.
Tally up the cost of the hull, fittings, weapons, and
defenses, and make sure that you haven’t overspent
your available power, mass, hardpoints, or budget.
Most TL4 worlds aren’t capable of building mechs.
They were always specialized tools, most useful in interplanetary warfare where logistics limits were tight,
and the lack of rare resources and need has contributed
to the loss of the tech. Still, at the GM’s discretion, some
worlds may still be able to build them from scratch.

MECH FITTINGS
Active Camo Surface: This sophisticated mix of chromatic paneling and holoprojectors renders the
mech surprisingly difficult to spot at a distance.
Suits gain a +2 bonus to Sneak skill checks made
against observers more than ten meters away.
Light mechs gain the same bonus against observers more than fifty meters away, and heavy mechs
apply it against spotters more than a hundred meters away.
Ammunition Cells: Mech guns are voracious with their
ammunition, and these cells increase the load
available to the mech’s guns. When making a Wis/
Shoot roll to determine whether or not a mech
has run out of ammo for a gun after a given fight,
the pilot can ignore the first failed skill check. The

world. The interval between radiation saving
throws is also multiplied by four.
Breaching Tool: A combination of a pickaxe and a demolitions charge, a breaching tool can be used to blow
a mech-sized hole in any standard postech building material with one round of effort. Against
hardened military structures designed specifically
to repel such efforts, the same hole takes 1d6+1
rounds to dig.
Bridging Laminates: A slurry of clastic composites
mixes with soil or gravel drawn into the mech’s
feed chutes before being projected into a tough,
durable bridge over chasms or trenches. A mech
can produce 20 meters of bridge per round to a
maximum distance of 60 meters for any single
span. The bridge can bear the weight of a mech
of the same size class that built it, and a total of
600 meters of bridges can be constructed between
maintenance cycles. Breaking a hole in the bridge
requires the infliction of 20 points of damage, or
40 to completely smash a span.
Cargo Space: This space is protected and pressurized.
If the mech is destroyed, the pilot rolls 1d6; the
cargo survives on a roll of 3 or more. Cargo space
in a suit can carry up to one hundred kilos. A light
mech can stow up to 500 kilos, and a heavy mech
can manage 2,000 kilos. Some cargo spaces are
refitted for passengers.
Comm Interceptors: These polyspectral snoops pick up
and automatically decrypt transmissions made
or received near the mech. Civilian comms are
automatically broken, while successfully compromising a military enemy’s comms requires line of
sight with the source or a recipient and a successful opposed Program skill check.
Construction Array: This mobile repair and construction array allows a mech to serve as a functioning
postech workshop and earthmover for field engineering purposes. A mech with a construction
array can be used to perform repairs and maintenance on itself and other mechs, if spare parts
are available. Most arrays allow for carrying up
to twice the mech’s own hit points in repair parts.
Drop Sheathing: Most mech drops involve nothing
more than grav chutes to slow the machine’s orbital insertion. Sometimes it’s necessary to drop
mechs in the teeth of an opposing force, in which
case drop sheathing is often added to a mech’s
equipment loadout. This ablative shielding burns
away in the atmosphere, but while it lasts, it forces
defending sensors to make a Program skill check
at difficulty 10 to detect the mech’s insertion.
Escape Pod: This armored cockpit is programmed to
eject from a fatally compromised mech, landing
the pilot in a random direction 1d20 x 100 meters
from the downed mech. Pilots with an escape pod
may reroll a failed Physical save to avoid mortal
injury when their mech is destroyed.

Field Medical Unit: Fire-and-forget medical drones and
heavy diagnostic computing support allow the
mech to provide medical treatment for downed
comrades. When the mech pilot spends a round
guiding the med drones, he provides trauma care
equivalent to a lazarus patch for up to twenty
downed allies within a two-hundred meter radius,
using his own Int/Heal for the skill check.
Fire Control Unit: These units come in master and slave
versions, with up to five slave units linking to a
single master. So long as the master unit’s mech
remains functional and within a one-kilometer
range, it and the other units linked with it can
assign weapon attacks one at a time, rolling hit
and damage for each before firing the next.
Grav Chutes: Mechs with grav chutes take no damage
from falls, even from orbital insertions.
Inquisitor Probe: By targeting a visible person or mech,
the psimech pilot with at least Telepath-1 can
force the person or pilot to make a Mental saving throw. If failed, the user gains an impression
of their current tactical plan and the foremost
thoughts in their mind. A successful save renders
the target immune to this fitting for 24 hours.
Integral Maintenance: This system can automatically
apply a maintenance cycle to itself with 30 minutes of downtime. A mech can carry supplies for
up to seven maintenance cycles in the unit.
Jump Coil: Any psychic teleporter can translocate their
own psimech, but the jump coil allows the pilot to
teleport up to five additional allied mechs of equal
or smaller size along with him, provided they are
within 10 meters of him.
Kinesis Boost: Any psionic with at least Telekinesis-1
can use this psitech to boost their Mech’s Speed
rating by 2 and gain +2 to all initiative rolls.
Neural Activity Sensors: This psitech functions for any
psionic, and allows them to automatically detect
the presence of sentient minds within two kilometers, with a margin of error of roughly 50 meters
for any given mind. The species of sentient can be
recognized, but not individuals.
Neural Static Generator: A counterpsi tech, this fitting
allows a psion with at least Metapsionics-1 to
automatically negate any psi-based mech fitting
targeted at it or any visible ally within 400 meters.
The mech also gains 5 additional points of Armor
against psi weapons.
Omen Tap: A psionic pilot can force a visible target to
reroll a successful hit roll or skill check. This ability can be used once per round, and a maximum
number of times per hour equal to the pilot’s Precognition skill level times two.
Panoptic Cloud: A swarm of tiny aerostat sensors surrounds the mech out to 200 meters, giving them a
constant awareness of their surroundings within
that range. The sensors provide both audio and
visual data, and only atmosphere-tight seals can

DESIGNING MECHS •307
keep them out. Their presence will trigger most
advanced security alarms, however.
Polyspectral Sensors: These sensors use an array of
emissions to form a crude model of the terrain 100
meters in front of the mech, providing rough detail down to objects one-third of a meter in size. It
cannot penetrate EM-hardened barriers, but does
not normally trigger security alerts.
Pulse Transceiver: The pulse transceiver effectively
functions as a faster-than-light communications
laser with a range sufficient to reach the outer rim
of a solar system. Provided the mech knows the location of a receiver, two-way communication can
be conducted. The data channel is limited to text
and still images. Commercial commsats can also
serve as receivers if a military unit is not available.
Skywatch Drones: These small aerostat drones are onethird of a meter in length, with a range of up to
ten kilometers. They can loiter above a site for
up to eight hours before losing power, and can
be recharged with an hour in the mech’s rack.

The drones have standard and infrared telescopic
video sensors and can hover at altitudes of up to
one thousand meters. While difficult to spot with
the naked eye, skywatch drones are very easy for
modern anti-air defenses to locate, and rarely last
more than ten or twenty seconds over a military
target before being brought down. Any damage
will bring down a drone, but hitting one at maximum altitude with a hand weapon requires a hit
on armor class 25.
Vivification Field: This psitech augmentation is designed to key onto recognized allies on the battlefield. When a mech equipped with a field is piloted
by a psychic with at least Biopsionics-1, it automatically stabilizes mortally wounded allies within
100 meters, with no action required by the pilot.
Void Thrusters: These microscale grav plates allow a
mech to fly at its normal base Speed. This flight
functions only in zero-gee or microgravity environments, but can eliminate falling damage in
standard gravity, even for orbital insertions.

MECH DEFENSES
Augmented ECM Projector: The quantum taps on this
mech have been tuned to interfere with the targeting of enemy weapon systems, at the cost of additional power drawn from the motive servos. The
mech has an effective +2 armor class bonus against
attacks from other vehicles or mechs, though its
Speed rating is reduced by 1.
Hardened Polyceramic Overlay: A relative of the same
hardened plating used on military warships, this
plating reduces the armor piercing quality of attacking weapons by 5. Thus, a heavy laser that
normally ignores 25 points of its target’s armor
now only ignores 20.
MES Shunt Channels: Complex psitech-derived shielding circuitry provides limited protection against
psi-based weapons, adding 10 points of Armor
that only count against weaponry with the Psi
quality. This armor stacks with any gained from
a Neural Static Generator.

Morphic Silhouette Damper: Holoprojectors and pulsed
ECM conspire to make it much more difficult to
fix the mech in a weapon’s sights. The effective
range of any weapon targeted at the mech is reduced by half. This benefit is lost if the attacker is
within 50 meters of the mech.
Redundant Systems Buffer: Substantial power and mass
is devoted to a complex array of redundant systems, increasing the amount of punishment the
heavy mech can take before it is finally destroyed.
Vanguard Plating: Blast vent channels, localized force
fields, and advanced damage control monitors
are used to defang armor-piercing weaponry
used against the heavy mech. The armor-piercing quality of an attacking weapon is reduced by
15. This defense does not stack with a Hardened
Polyceramic Overlay.

308• DESIGNING MECHS

MECH WEAPONRY
Mech weaponry normally requires Shoot skill to fire
and relies on the user’s Intelligence or Dexterity to determine hit and damage modifiers. Most NPC pilots
have a total attack bonus of +3 and damage bonus of
+1. Veteran pilots average +5 to hit and +2 damage,
while the grizzled elite rarely have less than +7 to hit
and +2 damage.
Some weapons can be fired to suppress. Every target in front of the weapon that is not under hard cover
is automatically hit for half normal damage, rounded
down. A successful Evasion saving throw by the targets
eliminates this damage.

Special Weapon Qualities

Ammo: This weapon uses physical ammunition. After
the end of every fight in which it was fired, the
pilot needs to make a Shoot skill check modified
by Wisdom against a difficulty of 6. On a failure,
ammo for the gun has run out until the next maintenance cycle is complete. The check difficulty increases by 1 after every fight until maintenance.
Anti-personnel: Armored vehicles, fortifications, and
light and heavy mechs are immune to these light
weapons.
AP: The weapon ignores this many points of a target’s
armor. The Hardened Polyceramic Overlay or Vanguard Plating defense upgrades may lessen the effectiveness of this quality. The most a weapon’s AP
rating can do is reduce a target’s effective armor
to zero. It cannot add additional damage to a hit.
Cone: The weapon fires in a conical pattern that many
meters long and wide at its end. All targets within
the cone must make an Evasion saving throw or
be hit, with no hit roll required. Targets behind
hard cover save automatically.
Melee: Melee weapons can only be used in hand-tohand combat, and no non-melee weapon can be
used that same round. Pilots use either Punch or
Stab for hit rolls. Mech melee weapons do not inflict Shock damage.
Psi: Psi weapons use metadimensional energy channels to completely ignore a target’s Armor rating,
except for any armor granted by the MES Shunt
Channel defense fitting. Defenses such as Hardened
Polyceramic Overlay have no effect on psi weaponry.
Pilots may optionally choose to use an appropriate
psychic skill with psi weapons, even melee varieties. Psi weapons rely on Wisdom or Constitution
to modify attack and damage rolls, rather than
Dexterity or Intelligence.
Slow: After firing, the attacker must roll an Int/Shoot
skill check against difficulty 8. For psi weapons,
use Int and an applicable psychic skill. On a failure,
the gun must cool down for one round before it
can be fired again.

Mech Weapon List

Banshee Vox: A focalized sonic blast stuns and disorients all organic life in the path of this weapon.
Damage done by a banshee vox is nonlethal, and
targets brought to 0 hit points by it will wake up
1d4 hours later with 1 hit point. Targets inside a
vehicle or behind hard cover are immune.
Beam Lance: More power-hungry and harder to mount
than a heavy laser, the beam lance is meant to cut
through heavy armor on enemy shock mechs.
Cutter Plates: Rotating blades, force-field shearing
planes, or just a really big axe; cutter plates are
meant for melee combat and carving large holes
through obstacles. Suit cutter plates do 1d12 damage, light mech ones do 2d12, and heavy mech
plates do 3d12.
Finger of God: A psitech weapon that can be mounted
only on psimechs and used by a psionically-active
pilot, the Finger of God is a brutal weapon that
operates soundlessly and without visible emissions. The psychic piloting the mech selects the
target and channels a massive surge of metadimensional energy through it. The blast ignores
all conventional armor and can be expected to
suddenly reduce anything smaller than a heavy
mech into a smoking heap of scrap.
Heavy Machine Gun: A standard choice for anti-personnel weaponry, though its TL3 tech makes
it useless against mech Armor. Upgraded TL4
equivalents cost twice as much.
Hydra Array: A standard gunnery weapon mounted on
a mech, fired in volleys as normal for the weapon.
Improvised Weapon: This object is something large
and heavy that the mech has snatched up to use
as a weapon. Suits do 1d8, light mech do 2d8, and
heavy do 3d8.
Inferno Projector: A spray of superheated plasma turns
everything within thirty meters of the projector’s
aperture into charcoal and casualty reports.
Laser, Anti-Air: This standard light laser has been retuned to optimize it for firing at airborne targets,
and the range has been greatly increased. It can
pick off spy units such as Skywatch Drones automatically once they have been spotted. The laser
is optimized for firing at “clean” airborne targets,
however, and suffers a -4 penalty to hit when aiming for ground-bound targets.
Laser, Anti-Vehicle: A standard gunnery weapon recalibrated for mech use. When it hits a target with
Armor, it can reroll any “1”s on the damage dice.
Laser, Heavy: A mainstay of heavy shock mechs.
Laser, Light: The light laser trades the enormous penetrating power of its heavier cousin for a lighter
power drain and easier fitting requirements.

# weapon can fire to suppress
MES Knife: This psitech weapon focuses a beam of
aligned metadimensional energy into a melee
weapon that ignores Armor ratings. Suits do 1d12
damage with the knife, light mechs do 2d12, and
heavies do 3d12.
Mindburner: Named for the horrific hallucinations
provoked in the few targets to survive a glancing
brush from the weapon, the mindburner ruthlessly boosts the electrical activity in its targets, burning out human minds and electronic devices with
equal efficiency. Conventional Armor is ignored
by the weapon.
Plasma Thrower: While the range of this energy weapon is shorter than that of a light laser, it brings
slightly more damage to the battlefield.
Rail Cannon: The queen of the battlefield, the rail cannon is a weapon so heavy it can only be mounted
on a heavy shock mech. A single rod from a rail
cannon can punch through the best vanguard defensive plating as if it were tissue. The weapon is
prone to overheating, however, and makes cruel
demands on a mech’s power grid.
Railgun: A standard gunnery weapon fitted for mech
use. Some pilots prefer it over the heavy laser for
the sake of the suppressive fire it can lay down its
good armor-piercing profile, albeit at the cost of
having to deal with ammo depletion at times.

Razor Cloud: Designed to counter infantry swarms, the
razor cloud pulses fractal shrapnel in a cloud of
steel around the mech. Any target within 30 meters is automatically hit, and may make an Evasion
save for half damage. Any target within 60 meters
is automatically hit for half damage, and may make
an Evasion save to take none. Hard cover protects
a subject from the cloud.
Rocket Launcher: A standard Heavy weapon, popular
with suit pilots who need more range than a heavy
machine gun can provide. Rocket launchers also
have difficulty in locking on targets of human size
or smaller, applying a -4 to any hit rolls against
them. Conventional rocket warheads are shaped
for maximum armor penetration rather than explosive radius, and mech pilots can use them even
against very close targets without blast danger.
Upgraded TL4 equivalents cost twice as much.
Vortex Cannon: While commonly mounted on grav
tanks, a vortex can also be fitted to a mech.
Wheatcutter Belts: A standard anti-personnel weapon
refitted for mech use. When triggered, a belt of
explosives fires off a scything blast of shrapnel on
any side of the mech. All creatures within 10 meters must make an Evasion save for half damage.
Those within 20 meters take half damage, and can
make an Evasion save to take none at all.

Speed: 4

Defenses None

A cheap baseline shock suit, the Achilles relies on its pilot’s skills to make up for the lack of elaborate hardware. The
rocket launcher gives the Achilles teeth against enemy armored vehicles or aircraft, while the cutter plates can chew
through a ferrocrete wall before rapidly shredding any defenders on the other side. Shock-grade armor plating helps
ensure that the Achilles can survive as a doorkicker for a strike team. Still, the loadout mix forces an Achilles pilot
to be extremely versatile in weapon handling skills for best results.

The Ulysses sacrifices all onboard weapons, leaving the pilot to defend himself with personal small arms in favor of
packing significant support hardware into the suit’s armored shell. Polyspectral sensors make the suit an excellent
scout and command unit, while the field medical unit aids in recovering downed allies. The antigrav nodes even allow
this suit to fly for extended periods, and a Ulysses can lift up to two of its allies with it as it vaults ground obstacles.

Eldritch engines that were rare even in their heyday, the Hecate was designed as a basic platform for a mech-trained
combat psychic. Its large amount of unassigned power and mass allowed the psychic to fit the particular support
hardware that best complemented his or her talents, while the integral MES knife was a backup weapon in case of
sudden confrontation. Most Hecate pilots were expected to remain well behind the front line. Their talents were
rare and valuable enough to risk only in the best causes, and much of the suit’s engineering margin was devoted to
advanced ECM and damage control systems.

Fittings Escape Pod, Neural Activity Sensors
Much like its smaller psi suit brethren, the Durandal is designed with substantial unassigned power and mass in order
to accept whatever psitech fittings best suit the skills of its pilot. These additions can substantially increase the cost
of the base hull, which is built to provide multiple redundant survival measures for a psychic pilot. Even a Durandal
without additional fittings can act as a near-faultless early warning system for incoming enemy sentients.

When a fortress stands between an army and victory, a Scorn is sent to correct the situation. Its massive armor plates
are immune to all but specially-fitted gunnery, and its integral weaponry can smash through almost any substance
known to human science. The Scorn is the product of late Second Wave military science, however, and is built for
a battlefield that will only rarely see an opposing mech force. It is somewhat less optimized for facing specialized
anti-mech units that are equipped with the right armor-piercing weaponry to take the beast down.

Fittings Construction Array, Integral Maintenance, Skywatch Drones, Polyspectral Sensors, Pulse Transceiver
While the Odium provides much the same communications and recon abilities as the smaller Durandal, it is distinguished by the heavy mech-killing laser it mounts and the integral construction array that allows it to serve as a
remote maintenance and repair facility for numerous other mechs. A single Odium can give a sufficient number of
techs the platform they need to keep an entire mech force operational in the field, or assist in constructing elaborate
field structures and fortifications.

Fittings Neural Activity Sensors
These vanishingly rare mechs were always somewhat experimental, even in the late days of humanity’s golden age.
The sheer mass of sophisticated psitech components requires for their construction was almost impossible to acquire
on the frontier, and the few Despites that are found in the modern day are almost always attached to Mandate military
research facilities. While substantial mass and power are left unused to allow for pilot-specific fittings, even an unfitted
Despite possesses enormous firepower. The psitech Finger of God weaponry can effortlessly bypass enemy armor,
and the gigantic MES blade generated by its melee defense array can carve open a gravtank with a few solid strokes.
