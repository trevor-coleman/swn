STARSHIPS
Countless ships rise from world upon world, the iron
dust of new-forged shipyards sent out to make bridges between the stars. For centuries, the privation and
chaos that followed the Scream have made any concern
beyond bare survival a luxury for all too many worlds.
The last century has seen a reawakening, however, as
myriad planets finally unlock the secrets of their own
worlds and learn to use their native resources to rebuild
the long-lost ships of their ancestors. The Silence is
ending and worlds are now beginning to reach out to
their unknown neighbors.
Different sectors have different degrees of development. In some regions of space, starships have now
been manufactured for centuries, with small spacecraft
easily obtained by private individuals and modest companies. These sectors have regular commerce between
worlds, with interstellar drills no more remarkable
than modern air travel. Aliens and offworlder humans
are noticed but go without special remark. These sectors often have relatively large stellar polities made up
of numerous member stars, ones which often share the
same general culture or political form. These sectors
may still have backward planets or unknown worlds,
but these are the exception.
In most Stars Without Number sectors, however,
things aren’t that developed. Some worlds will have
developed or retained functional shipyards and interstellar flight is not anything remarkable to their citizens,
but ownership of a starship is still a rare thing. Entire
planetary navies might have fewer than a dozen ships,
and only powerful and influential worlds will be sporting cruisers or other heavy warships. There is enough
commercial traffic to justify starports and trade stations,
but free and easy transit between worlds has been lost
for centuries, and is only slowly returning to the sector.
These sectors are rich in potential adventure. Even
developed worlds may not be completely familiar with
their stellar neighbors, and a number of lost worlds
and out-of-contact societies can still be found in the
sector. Starship captains can never be entirely certain
what they’re going to meet when they drill into such a
system, and no world is strong enough to exert its will
carelessly around distant stars.

Acquiring Starships

In most sectors, it’s possible to buy civilian starships
on any TL4 world. Such civilian ships are almost exclusively fighter or frigate-class hulls, most usually free
merchants or in-system shuttles, though a few wealthy
worlds offer bulk freighter hulls as well. These ships
might be armed to the extent that their buyer’s purse
allows, but they are no match for real warships, and
so few planets worry too much about who might buy
them. Conspicuous acquisition of numerous armed
merchants, however, might draw unwelcome interest.

Military hulls are a different matter. Even a lowly
patrol boat is rarely permitted to a civilian buyer, let
alone a fleet cruiser or other ship of the line. Even when
these ships can be purchased, crewing them adequately
can be far beyond the limits of an adventuring party’s purse. Even so, heroes who make the right friends
or do the right favors to a planetary government can
sometimes get letters of marque that entitle them to
purchase hulls that would not normally be allowed into
civilian hands.
Buying a ship is only one way to acquire it, however. Many adventurers find it more efficient to liberate
a craft from undeserving owners, with an evening’s
play revolving around the daring deeds and cunning
subterfuge needed to acquire or salvage a ship for the
party. Of course, the craft acquired by this means are
rarely in perfect condition.
The ship and fitting prices that follow in this section assume that starships are uncommon and expensive investments, as they are in most sectors. If you are
running a campaign in a region of easier access to ships,
you should halve or even quarter the prices.

Navies and Piracy

Most TL4 worlds have some sort of space navy, even if
it’s only a handful of patrol boats to watch the asteroid
mines and monitor orbital space around their homeworld. A typical poor world might have a corvette and
a half-dozen patrol boats, while the average TL4 planet
sports a fleet cruiser, four corvettes or heavy frigates,
and ten patrol boats, and a rich planet might have three
times as many ships, possibly even a battleship or carrier to form the heart of its fleet. A third of these ships
are usually in dock at any one time.
The threat of piracy varies from system to system.
Pirates need a safe place to refit their ships and sell their
stolen goods, and they need enough traffic to justify
their trade. The ideal pirate system is one containing
only a low-tech primitive world that can be raided for
slaves and supplies, with a hidden or mobile deep-space
repair base for maintenance, and two or more wealthy
neighboring systems that send trade through. Such a
pirate nest can persist for years, with system governments arguing over who should bear the cost of rooting
them out, or too weak to overcome a charismatic pirate
leader and their loot-hungry followers.
Very few pirates operate in a system with a strong
naval presence. Small ships can sometimes get away
with it for a time, hiding out in asteroid belts, striking
merchants from ambush, and fleeing to safer systems
before help can arrive. Larger pirate flotillas are a more
existential threat to a planetary navy, and they are soon
dispersed… or made the effective masters of the system
as they blow up any ship that could prevent them from
obtaining space supremacy.

94• BUILDING A STARSHIP

BUILDING A STARSHIP
Creating a starship in Stars Without Number is fairly
simple, and requires only a few steps.
First, pick a hull type for the ship from the list
below. The type will indicate the price of the base hull
with a drive-1 spike drive, along with the available free
power and mass.
Second, add fittings, weapons, and defenses from
the pages that follow. Each such addition takes up a
certain amount of power and mass, and may have a
minimum hull size required for installation. Some fittings and defenses cost more in money, power, or mass
when installed on larger ships.
Third, decide how many crew members the ship
will have. Most merchantmen run with no more than
twice the minimum number of crew to save on wages.
Warships rarely leave port with less than 75% of the
maximum crew allowed. On average, crew members

cost 100 credits a day in wages, plus 20 more for necessary food and stores. PCs, naturally, are unlikely to
charge themselves wages, but they need to eat.
Fourth, note down the six-month maintenance
cost of the ship, which is equal to 5% of its total noncrew cost. If this fee isn’t paid, a -1 penalty is applied to
all skill checks and hit rolls related to the ship for each
maintenance period skipped.
Lastly, fill in a ship record for the craft, marking
down the ship’s statistics and the attack bonuses for the
gunners using the ship’s weapons.
The speed of building or modifying a ship will depend on the quality of available shipyards and the political importance of the job. On average, 25,000 credits
a day of work or modifications can be done by most
shipyards on average-importance jobs. Enough reason
to rush can double or even quadruple this amount.

STARSHIP HULLS
Starship hulls are divided into four general hull classes:
fighters, frigates, cruisers, and capital ships. The size
of each class varies depending on the technological sophistication and available resources of their creators. In
some sectors a smuggler’s free merchant frigate might
measure no more than 34.75 meters from nose to tail,
while in another it might be four times as large. As a
general proportion, each class’ average size is usually
from four to eight times larger than the class before it.
Each hull has several base attributes. Individual
models might vary slightly, and careful tuning and customization might alter these numbers as described later,
but most ships of a given hull type will perform as listed.
Cost is the price of the base hull with a drive-1
class spike drive. Any military hull type is generally
unavailable without very good naval contacts with a
shipyard’s owning government or a carefully-placed
favor to those in authority.
Speed is the relative combat speed and maneuverability of a ship. Over long distances a ship’s spike drive
rating is all that matters, but in the tight quarters of
combat this can make a great difference. A ship’s Speed
is added to all Pilot skill checks made by the craft’s pilot,
whether in combat or performing other maneuvers.
Armor is the measure of the ship’s plating and redundant systems, and is subtracted from any incoming
damage from hostile fire or hazardous space environments. Ship-mounted weapons with the Armor Piercing trait may ignore part or all of this rating. Ships
generally cannot be harmed by anything short of other
ship’s guns, vehicle-mounted Heavy weapons or carefully-placed demo charges.
Hit Points reflects the amount of damage the ship
can take before it explodes or becomes inoperable.

Crew lists the minimum crew necessary for basic
operation and the maximum crew the life support system can sustain for two months. Smaller crews than
the maximum will make the ship’s life support last proportionately longer. While it’s theoretically possible for
a lone crewman to make a successful spike drill, the
constant vigilance and wakefulness required mandates
the use of heavy pharmaceuticals and great desperation.
A minimum of three crew are normally required for a
relatively safe drill.
Armor Class is a combination of agility and effective ECM denoting the difficulty of landing a solid hit
on the ship.
Power is the amount of free power available after
the ship’s basic operation is taken into account. Fittings
and weapons take up some part of this power.
Mass records the amount of free mass left unassigned by the hull’s design. This free mass can be filled
with fittings, weapons, or cargo holds.
Hardpoints indicate how many weapons a ship can
successfully mount. Most weapons take up one hardpoint, though particularly large or power-hungry ones
may take up more than that.
Finally, the class of the particular hull shows the
general size of the ship. Some fittings and weapons
have a minimum hull class, beneath which a ship is
just too small to successfully install the hardware.
Starship hulls are sturdy enough to ignore damage
from small arms or TL3 Heavy weapons. TL4 Heavy
weapons or demo charges applied to the exterior of a
ship do half damage minus the ship’s Armor. If a saboteur gets inside with such weapons, the damage is
halved but Armor does not apply. Use of some Heavy
weapons in confined areas may be decidedly imprudent.

BUILDING A STARSHIP •95

Hull Types

The hull types listed below are some of the most common models found throughout the remnants of human space. Individual worlds often experiment with
different vessels as they gradually develop their own
astronautic doctrines, but these models have the benefit
of long and proven utility.
Strike Fighter: Small craft, often modified to replace
the spike drive with a system drive. Their speed,
cheapness, and combat utility make them a popular choice as inexpensive system patrol craft.
Shuttle: The smallest craft that’s regularly used for interstellar drills, a shuttle is a cheap means of moving
small amounts of precious material or important
persons between worlds.
Free Merchant: A hull type much beloved by adventurers, a free merchant has unimpressive combat
utility but can carry substantial amounts of cargo
while mounting enough weaponry to discourage
small-craft piracy.
Patrol Boat: The hull of choice for customs cutters and
system law enforcement, the patrol boat is a light
frigate built heavy enough to overawe small merchant vessels while still being relatively cheap to
build and crew.
Corvette: The smallest true combat frigate, and often
simply called a “frigate” by spacers. Corvettes have
significantly thicker armor than patrol boats and
trade additional crew needs and less maneuverability for more available free mass.
Heavy Frigate: The heaviest starship that most poor
or resource-deprived worlds can build, the heavy
frigate can carry a significant loadout of weaponry
and has enough crew to overwhelm most pirate
ships if it comes to a boarding action. While it
packs a substantial punch, it lacks the armor of a
true cruiser-class warship.
Bulk Freighter: This class of huge cargo ship is found
most often in peaceful, heavily-populated sectors.

Fleet Cruiser: The favored ship of the line of most
wealthy, advanced worlds, and often the biggest
and most powerful ship most planets can build. A
cruiser’s heavy armor and infrastructural support
for heavy guns make it a lethal weapon against
frigates and any other ship not optimized for
cracking heavy armor. They can prove vulnerable to swarm attacks by fighter-bombers equipped
with the right kind of armor-piercing weapons.
Battleship: Dreaded hulks of interstellar war, very few
worlds have the necessary technology or economy
to support the massive expense of building and
crewing a battleship. Those that do gain access
to a ship that is largely invulnerable to anything
short of specially-designed anti-capital cruisers or
hunter-killer frigates.
Carrier: The queen of a fleet, even fewer polities can
afford to build one of these huge ships. Carriers
can support flights of fighter or frigate-class warships, ones specially equipped to handle particular
missions. This versatility allows it to load fighter-bombers for anti-capital missions one month,
and then switch to swarms of hunter-killer frigates the next when a hostile system’s asteroid outposts need to be destroyed. Stripped of its combat
wings, however, a carrier has less individual firepower than a cruiser.
Stations: Almost every space-faring world has at least
one space station in orbit. A station has no Speed
score, no spike drive, and cannot perform any
maneuvers in combat, though its transit jets can
slowly move it around a solar system over a matter
of weeks. Civilian trade stations allow for docking
by bulk freighters and ships not cleared to land on
the surface, while military stations strictly forbid
any civilian docking. The small station listed here
is a Bannerjee-12, a common model found on poor
or backwater worlds with little traffic. The large
station represents an Arx, a major trade station for
a hub world with money to spare.

96• BUILDING A STARSHIP

STARSHIP FITTINGS
The following list of ship fittings are largely standard
TL4 technologies that are available in most sectors. A
few items on the list are rare pretech devices that cannot be acquired without special connections or a lucky
feat of salvage.
Some costs are marked with an asterisk. These
costs are multiplied by 10 when the fitting is installed
in a frigate-class hull, by 25 when installed in a cruiser-class hull, and by 100 when installed in a capital ship.
Some power and mass entries are marked with a
hashmark. These costs are multiplied by 2 for frigates,
3 for cruisers, and 4 for capital ships, rounded up. Note
that you apply these multipliers even if the fitting only
works on a large ship; a frigate with a Drill Course Regulator pays 250,000 credits, not 25,000.
Advanced research lab: A lab suitable for investigating
alien xenolife, planetary geology, esoteric technology, and other mysteries of the cosmos. The lab
contains cold sleep pods adequate to contain alien
samples, viro-shielded research cells, high-energy
lasers, and other requisite tools. When used to investigate some phenomenon or object, any applicable skill rolls are improved by +1 for a frigate lab,
+2 for a cruiser lab, and +3 for a capital ship lab.
Advanced nav computer: Forging new spike courses is
too much an art to rely on computerized assistance, but an advanced nav computer can help on
well-mapped routes. When navigating an interstellar drill course with charts less than a year old,
the navigator decreases drill difficulty by 2.
Amphibious operation: This fitting includes the benefits
of the Atmospheric Configuration fitting, as well as
allowing the ship to operate while immersed in a
liquid medium. Submerged ships cannot be detected with conventional planetary traffic sensors
and require military sonar and naval sensors to fix
their position, resources often unavailable on less
developed worlds. So long as the ship stays away
from military naval craft and bases, it is almost
impossible to track while submerged. Only fighter
and frigate hull classes can mount this fitting.
Armory: Rather than maintaining lengthy lists of ship
equipment, a captain can simply buy an armory.
Ships so equipped have whatever amounts of TL4
military-grade weaponry and armor that a crew
might require, and integral maintenance facilities
for its upkeep. There is enough gear available to
outfit the entire crew for normal use, but giving
it away or losing it in use may deplete it.
Atmospheric configuration: This fitting must be put
in place when the ship is built, and cannot be
installed on cruiser-class or larger ships. A ship
designed for atmospheric flight can land on most
solid or aqueous surfaces.

Auto-targeting system: Some ships run with more guns
than crewmen. A single NPC or PC can man one
gun per round, firing it as often as the gunnery
chief’s Fire One Weapon or Fire All Guns actions
allow, but sometimes that’s not enough. Installing
an autonomic targeting system for a gun allows it
to shoot at a +2 hit bonus without human assistance. This system must be installed once for each
gun that is to be self-manned.
Automation support: The ship has been carefully fitted
to support the use of non-sentient expert system
robots in its operation. At least one human, VI,
or True AI crew member is necessary to oversee
the bots and monitor spike drills, but otherwise
crew may be replaced with cheap, basic robots at
a cost of 1,000 credits per crew member replaced.
Bots don’t draw pay, don’t take up life support,
and their maintenance is assumed to be part of the
ship’s operating costs. These bots are incapable of
any actions unrelated to operating the ship and
are treated as level-0 in their skills where relevant.
Boarding tubes: Armored tubes equipped with laser cutter apertures can be used to forcibly invade a hostile ship, provided the target’s engines have been
disabled. Ships without boarding tubes have to
send invaders across empty space to either make
an assault on a doubtless heavily-guarded airlock
or cut their way in through the hull with laser
cutters and half an hour of work.
Cargo lighter: Cruisers and larger craft can’t land on
planetary bodies, so they require small shuttlecraft for transport. A cargo lighter is only capable
of surface-to-orbit flight, which takes roughly
twenty minutes either way, but can latch on to
a standard pressurized cargo container holding
up to 200 tons of cargo and passengers. These
containers are usually collapsible and take up no
significant space when compressed for storage, assuming they’re not simply disposable cargo shells.
This fitting can be purchased multiple times.
Cargo space: Free mass can be traded for pressurized
cargo space. Tracked by weight for convenience,
one cubic meter is usually one ton, with most vehicles requiring ten tons when loaded, tanks taking 25, and aircraft or mechs taking up 50 tons of
cargo space. One point of free mass grants 2 tons
of cargo space in a fighter, 20 tons in a frigate, 200
tons in a cruiser, and 2000 tons in a capital-class
ship. This fitting can be purchased multiple times.
Cold sleep pods: These stasis pods can keep a subject
alive for centuries provided that the ship’s power
doesn’t fail. Each installation allows for keeping
a number of people equal to the ship’s maximum
crew in stasis indefinitely. This fitting can be installed multiple times.

98• BUILDING A STARSHIP
Colony core: The ship has been designed to act as the
core of a future settlement. Once this fitting is
engaged, the ship ceases to be operational as a
starship, and builds out into a set of habitats, hydroponic gardens, fusion plants, and living spaces
sufficient to support up to five times its maximum
crew, including enough fabrication and workshop
facilities to keep the settlement operational under normal conditions. The settlement can be a
deep-space hab, orbital installation, or planetary
settlement. In the latter case, the ship must land
to form the settlement; even ships without atmospheric operations can do so, but they can never
take off again. Once activated, a colony core cannot be re-packed.
Drill course regulator: Drills along a known spike drive
route have no chance of failure so long as the route
is no longer than twice the operating pilot’s skill
level and does not involve course trimming. Thus,
a navigator with Pilot-1 skill would always succeed
in making a drill of two hexes or less, provided the
route was a known one. The drill course regulator requires a sophisticated technical base and
compatible metadimensional energy conditions
in a given sector; many sectors no longer have
this technology or lack the right environment to
use it. If the GM prefers a campaign where space
travel is always at least somewhat dangerous, they
may deny access to this fitting. Ships piloted by
exceptionally talented navigators may choose not
to mount it even then.
Drive upgrades: A ship can improve its standard-issue
drive-1 spike drive with additional phase filters
and power throughput refinements. A captain
needs buy only the final grade of drive desired. He
does not have to buy upgrades sequentially. Drives
of rating 4 and higher are generally TL5 artifacts
that cannot be built most modern worlds.
Drop pod: Armored and stealthed versions of cargo
lighters, these craft are twice as fast, apply a -3
penalty to tracking and targeting skill checks, and
can carry up to one hundred troops or passengers.
Many are equipped with assorted Heavy weapons
to clear the landing zone, and can be treated as
flight-capable gravtanks for purposes of combat.
This fitting can be purchased multiple times.
Emissions dampers: Stealth systems can mask the ship’s
energy emissions through careful modulation of
the output. All travel times inside a star system are
doubled when the system is engaged, but any skill
checks to avoid detection gain a +2 bonus.
Exodus bay: These banked rows of compressed cold
sleep pods are designed to carry enormous numbers of people in extended hibernation, most often colonists to some new homeworld or escapees
from some stellar disaster. A cruiser can carry up
to 1,000 colonists in stasis, while a capital ship
can handle up to 5,000. Each further time this fit-

ting is selected, these numbers double. These pods
put their inhabitants into very deep hibernation
so as to minimize the resources necessary to maintain their lives. Bringing them out of this stasis
requires a month of “defrost”. Crash awakenings
have a 25% chance of killing the subject. The pods
are rated for 100 years of stasis, but their actual
maximum duration is somewhat speculative.
Extended life support: The ship can be designed to accommodate a larger number of crew or passengers.
Extended life support can be fitted multiple times;
each time, the maximum crew rating of the ship
increases by 100% of its normal maximum. Thus,
a free merchant who installs this twice can have a
maximum complement of 18 people.
Extended medbay: All ships are equipped with basic
medical facilities for curing lightly injured crew
members and keeping the seriously injured ones
stable until reaching a planet. An extended medbay improves those facilities, allowing for the
medical treatment of up to the ship’s entire maximum crew at once, including the treatment of
critically wounded passengers.
Extended stores: A normal complement of ship’s stores
can keep the maximum crew size supplied for two
months. Each selection of Extended Stores doubles
that time, and can be fitted multiple times.
Fuel bunkers: Most ships require refueling after each
drill jump, no matter the distance. Installing fuel
bunkers allows the ship to carry one additional
load of fuel. This fitting can be installed multiple
times for ships that wish to minimize fueling.
Fuel scoops: Fuel scoops allow for the harvesting and
extraction of hydrogen from gas giants or the
penumbra of solar bodies. The extraction process
requires four days of processing and refinement,
but completely refuels the ship. Such fittings are
common on explorer craft that cannot expect to
find refueling stations.
Hydroponic production: Some ships are designed to produce food and air supplies for the crew. Selecting
hydroponic production allows for the indefinite
supply of a number of crewmen equal to the ship’s
maximum crew. This option may be taken multiple times for farm ships, in which case each additional selection doubles the number of people the
ship can support.
Lifeboats: Selecting this fitting equips the ship with
a number of single-use escape craft capable of
reaching the nearest habitable planet or station
in a star system. If no such destination exists,
the boats can maintain their passengers for up
to a year in drugged semi-stasis. Lifeboats have
fully-functional comm systems and are usually
equipped with basic survival supplies and distress
beacons. A single selection of this fitting provides
enough lifeboats for a ship’s maximum crew, with
up to twenty people per boat.

BUILDING A STARSHIP •99

Luxury cabins: Each time this fitting is selected, 10%
of the ship’s maximum crew gain access to luxury cabins of a spaciousness sufficient to please
a wealthy star-farer. This fitting comes with the
usual zero-gee athletic courts, decorative fountains, fine dining, and artistic fittings.
Mobile extractor: Automated mining and refinery
equipment has been built into the ship, allowing
it to extract resources from asteroids and planetary surfaces. Careful extraction of specific lodes
of valuable minerals can be quite profitable at the
GM’s discretion, but if the crew is simply melting down available asteroids for raw materials,
the unit can refine one ton of usable materials
per day worth about 500 credits in most markets.
These raw materials can be used to feed a mobile
factory, and a ship may have more than one mobile extractor fitted to it to multiply the return
if sufficient raw feedstock is available. Operating
an extractor requires at least five crew members.
Mobile factory: The ship is equipped with a full-scale
TL4 fabrication plant programmed to support its
needs. The ship can stock raw materials and parts
at 5,000 credits per ton; these parts can then be
used to “pay” ship repair or maintenance costs
when conventional shipyards are unavailable. The
factory can also create and repair vehicles, TL4
equipment, space habs, and planetary structures
with these parts at a rate of 10,000 credits worth
of construction a day. If a mobile extractor is
available, the raw materials processed by the latter unit can be used to feed the factory. Operating
a mobile factory requires at least 100 well-trained
personnel. Each 10 fewer available doubles repair
or maintenance times.

Precognitive nav chamber: An extremely rare example
of psitech dating from before the Scream, a precognitive nav chamber allows a character with at
least Precognition-2 psionic skill to assist in interstellar drills, sensing impending shear alterations
before they happen. The navigator automatically
succeeds on any spike drill check of difficulty 9 or
less. On a failed check, add 2 to the Spike Drive
Mishap roll, limiting the potential damage. On
drilling in to the destination system, the psychic
has expended all Effort in the process.
Psionic anchorpoint: This pretech relic is unavailable on
the open market in most sectors. Once installed
in a ship, it can be “imprinted” by up to a dozen
psychics. These psychics can sense and affect any
object or location within ten meters of the relic
after one minute of concentration, provided they
are within the same solar system. Thus, teleporters can always teleport next to the anchorpoint,
telepaths can always contact anyone within the
affected zone, telekinetics can manipulate objects
near the relic, and so forth. The relic can be recoded to eliminate existing imprints, but any psychic who gets access to the relic for ten minutes of
meditation and focus can imprint on it afterwards.
There is no obvious way to tell how many psychics
have imprinted to the anchorpoint.
Sensor mask: The ship can disguise its long-range sensor readings, spoofing scans with the ID tags and
apparent hull type of any other ship of its choice.
To penetrate this masquerade, the scanning entity must beat a Wis/Program skill check against
difficulty 10 plus the Program skill of the masking ship’s comms officer. Once the ship is close
enough to visually identify, the masking is useless.

100• BUILDING A STARSHIP
Ship bays: These sophisticated docking bays provide
all the necessary tools and support for launching
a starship from the mother craft. They are rarely seen outside of dedicated capital-class carriers,
but some cruisers make room to mount a fighter-class attack shuttle. Each bay allows room for
one ship of the appropriate hull class. While the
carried ship can support its own crew if necessary, most carriers fold their space wing into the
mothership’s crew roster. This fitting can be taken
multiple times.
Ship’s locker: Much like an armory, this option allows
a captain to lay in a general supply of equipment
likely to be useful to explorers and spacemen. Any
TL4 equipment on the gear list can be found in
the ship’s locker in amounts commensurate with
the ship’s size. A few guns and some basic armor
might be included as well, but for serious armament an armory is required. There is enough gear
available to outfit the entire crew for normal use,
but giving it away or losing it in use may deplete
the locker until it is restocked.
Shiptender mount: The ship is designed with symbiosis
mounts that allow other ships to “hitch” on the
craft’s spike drills. Each shiptender mount allows
one craft of a hull size smaller than the tender to
link up for intersystem drills. Mounts cannot be
used for in-system travel. If the linking ship has
been designed to be carried by a tender then establishing this link takes one hour. If not, it takes
a full day to fit the ship into the mount. Ships can
dismount from the tender with an hour’s disentanglement. In an emergency, the carried ships can
dismount instantly, but the mountings are considered disabled then until repairs are made. Carried
ships cannot fight.
Smuggler’s hold: Carefully-designed storage space intended to conceal illicit cargo from customs inspection. Each installation of this fitting adds 200
kilograms of cargo space in a fighter, 2 tons in a
frigate, 20 tons in a cruiser, or 200 tons in a capital ship. Cargo in a smuggler’s hold will never be
found by a standard customs inspection. Careful
investigation by a suspicious official can find it on
a difficulty 10 check using their Wis/Notice skill,
and a week-long search one step short of disassembly will find it on a difficulty 7 check.
Survey sensor array: Most ships require only basic
analysis of a star system, sufficient to identify
population centers, do rough scanning of an object’s composition, and chart major navigational
hazards. Survey sensor arrays greatly enhance
the ship’s sensor abilities, allowing for finely-detailed mapping of objects and planets, along with
broad-spectrum communications analysis. They
also improve attempts to detect other craft when
scanning a region for stealthy vessels. Any rolls
with survey sensor arrays add +2 to skill checks.

System drive: The ship’s standard drive-1 spike drive is
removed and replaced with a different propulsion
system. The ship is still treated as having a drive-1
for maneuvering and system transit purposes, but
it cannot make interstellar drills. This modification lowers the cost of the basic hull by 10% and
adds extra power and space based on the size of
the hull: 1 power for fighters, 2 for frigates, 3 for
cruisers, and 4 for capital ship hulls. Twice this
amount of free mass is gained by the process.
Teleportation pads: This TL5 tech is completely unavailable in most sectors and was uncommon even on
Mandate-era ships. The pads allow up to a dozen
people or 1,200 kilograms of matter to be teleported to and from the surface of a planet or the
interior of a another ship, provided it is no more
than a few tens of thousands of kilometers distant.
Ship-to-ship teleportation is possible only when
the receiving ship is cooperating by transmitting
accurate coordinate details; otherwise, a friendly,
unjammed signal from inside is necessary to lock
onto the target point. Planetary teleportations are
possible only in the absence of physical barriers
between the ship and the target point below. The
teleporters may be used once every five minutes.
In those rare sectors where this tech is widely
available, it costs 200k.
Tractor beams: Gravitic projectors allow the ship to manipulate objects within its immediate area, pushing, pulling, and sliding objects no larger than a
ship of one hull class smaller. Targets with shipscale propulsion can resist the beams, but lifeboats,
individual suit jets, or other smaller propulsors
are inadequate. The beam can focus on only one
object at a time but can move it into the ship’s
cargo bays or hurl it out of the ship’s immediate
vicinity within three rounds. The beams can only
effectively manipulate objects in very low gravity,
and not those on the surface of planets or other
objects with significant natural gravity.
Vehicle transport fittings: The ship has been fitted with
specialized mounts, bunking, cargo bays, and
other facilities to expedite the transport of often-unwieldy vehicles, including mechs and other
military craft. Any vehicles carried count as only
half their usual cargo tonnage. Assuming trained
operators, up to four vehicles can be offloaded or
ramped onto the ship per round in cases where
speed is critical.
Workshops: On-board workshops can be bought at
smaller than maximum sizes than a hull would allow, if additional TL4 tech facilities aren’t strictly
needed. A frigate-sized workshop is sufficient for
modding any personal gear as per the modification
rules on page 90. A cruiser-sized workshop handles vehicle modding and starship maintenance,
and a capital-class workshop can build vehicles or
similar large work from scratch at full cost.

BUILDING A STARSHIP •101

STARSHIP DEFENSES
The defenses listed here are some of the more common
ones installed in modern TL4 starships. Most non-warships mount little or nothing in the way of special defenses, preferring to save the hull space for cargo and
immediately useful fittings.
Ablative Hull Compartments: By sacrificing empty hull
space in a complex system of ablative blast baffles,
a capital-class ship can have a large amount of its
total mass shot away without actually impinging
on its normal function. This grants it a +1 AC
bonus and 20 extra maximum hit points.
Augmented Plating: At the cost of a certain amount of
speed and maneuverability, a ship can have its armor plating reinforced against glancing hits, gaining a +2 bonus to its AC. This augmentation can
decrease a ship’s Speed below 0, meaning it will
be applied as a penalty to all Pilot tests.
Boarding Countermeasures: The ship has hardened
bulkheads, reinforced hatches, and specially-designed automated kill corridors for wiping out
intruders. Provided that the ship’s bridge is still
under control, the operator can prevent entry to
the ship by any force that lacks shipyard-grade
tools, weapons capable of melting hull plating,
or specialized military breaching implements. If
intruders do get inside, only well-equipped, specially-trained marines have any real chance of
breaching the defenses. Ordinary space pirates or
more casual invaders have only a 1 in 6 chance
of threatening the bridge crew, though they may
cause significant damage in their dying.
Burst ECM Generator: A high-powered secondary ECM
generator can be activated to negate any one otherwise-successful hit against the ship. This generator can be activated after the damage has been
rolled, but enemy ships rapidly compensate for the
new ECM source, and so the generator can only
be used effectively once per engagement.

Foxer Drones: These drones are invariably short-lived
due to the enormous energy signatures they produce, but until the ship’s next turn they grant a +2
AC bonus as their emissions confuse foes. Foxer
drones are cheaply constructed and essentially
free; the only limit on their number is the amount
of free space set aside for holding them.
Grav Eddy Displacer: This system links with a ship’s
navigational subsystem and randomizes the motion vectors in sympathy with metadimensional
gravitic currents. This agility gives any hit on the
ship a 1 in 6 chance of being negated entirely.
Hardened Polyceramic Overlay: A complex glazing process can harden the surface of a ship’s armor to
more effectively shed incoming attacks, decreasing the armor-piercing quality of any hit by 5.
Planetary Defense Array: The ship is equipped with
an array of gravitic braker guns and an upgraded nuke snuffer field. While useless in conventional ship-to-ship combat, the array can deflect
or dampen meteor impacts, dropped penetrator
rods, or other non-powered bombardment techniques, and the snuffer field is powerful enough
to prevent nuclear fission reactions over a hemisphere-sized area. A single ship with a PDA can
protect against any natural meteor strikes and
deny easy terror bombardment of a planet’s population. The PDA cannot fully protect against
orbital strikes by powered penetrators, but it can
nudge them off course and make pinpoint strikes
impractical. Most developed planets have much
more powerful and effective ground installations,
but a PDA-equipped ship is a useful emergency
stopgap for poor or primitive worlds.
Point Defense Lasers: Too small to damage ships, these
point defense lasers can detonate or melt incoming munitions, improving the ship’s defenses
against torpedoes, fractal impact charges, and
other ammunition-based weapons.

102• BUILDING A STARSHIP

STARSHIP WEAPONRY
Space is dangerous, and most ships mount the best
weapons their purse and their ship’s infrastructure
can support. While most worlds limit the purchase of
warships by civilians, few place restraints on the type
of weapons a civilian ship can mount.
Ship weaponry tends to come in two classes. One
class of weapon is damaging and has moderate power and mass demands, but has comparatively weak
armor-piercing capabilities. Another class of weapon is expensive, taxing to a ship’s systems, and may
have somewhat inferior damage, but it has enough armor-piercing to affect a warship of a hull size one step
larger than the mounting starship.
The choice of which class of weapon to mount
usually depends on the type of opposition the designer
expects the ship to face. Most civilian ships favor the
former kind, as few expect to engage true warships.

Weapon Qualities

Ammo: The weapon or defense requires ammunition
to fire. Each round’s cost is listed after the weapon’s cost, and a number of rounds equal to the
weapon’s Ammo rating can be fit into one free
mass unit. For example, a torpedo launcher can fit
the magazine and loading gear for four torpedoes
into one free mass unit, and each torpedo will cost
2,500 credits. For each ship class larger than the
minimum required to mount the weapon, double
the stored ammo per unit. The weapon itself includes one free mass unit worth of ammunition
as part of the installation, so simply mounting a
torpedo launcher alone on a frigate gives the ship
four rounds of ammo.
AP: The weapon ignores this many points of a target’s
armor. The Hardened Polyceramic Overlay defense
upgrade may lessen the effectiveness of this quality. The most a weapon’s AP rating can do is reduce
a target’s effective armor to zero. It cannot add
additional damage to a hit.
Cloud: The weapon fires an omni-directional wave
or spray of projectiles. It automatically targets
all fighter-class ships that have attacked the ship
within the past round, and the gunner may make
one attack roll against each target. Cloud weapons
have no effect on ships larger than fighter-class
hulls or intruders who are actually on the hull.
Clumsy: Either through a slow discharge time or unwieldy engineering requirements, this weapon
suffers -4 to hit small fighter-class hulls.
Flak: These weapons launch vast numbers of small
energy discharges or projectiles, and are particularly dangerous to small ships that rely on speed
over thick armor. Against fighter-class hulls, these
weapons roll hit rolls and damage rolls twice and
take the better result.

Weapon Descriptions

Each weapon listed below has a cost, the damage die it
uses on a hit, and the amount of hardpoints, free power,
and mass it takes up in a hull. The minimum hull class
required to mount it is also listed, as is the minimum
tech level to manufacture it.
All ship weapon attack and damage rolls use the
better of the gunner’s Intelligence or Dexterity modifiers. Most use Shoot as the relevant skill, though Pilot
can be used for the guns of a fighter-class ship.

Multifocal Laser: Twinned assay and penetration lasers modulate the frequency of this beam for remarkable armor penetration. These weapons are
popular choices for fighters intended for frigate
or cruiser engagement.
Reaper Battery: Stepped tapping of the spike drive
power plant allows for the emission of a torrent
of charged particles. The particles have very little
armor penetration, but can fry a small ship’s power grid in a strike or two.
Fractal Impact Charge: A spray of penetrator sabots that
use fractal surfacing to increase impact. Favored
for bomber-class fighter hulls.
Polyspectral MES Beam: A rare example of pretech
weaponry, a fighter equipped with a PMB can
scratch even a battleship’s hull.
Sandthrower: Projecting a spray of tiny, dense particulate matter, sandthrowers are highly effective
against lightly-armored fighters.
Flak Emitter Battery: A baseline frigate anti-fighter system, this battery fires waves of lasers or charged
particles to knock down small craft.
Torpedo Launcher: Capable of damaging even a battleship, torpedoes are cumbersome, expensive, and
often the core of a line frigate’s armament.
Charged Particle Caster: A focalized upgrade to the
reaper battery, the CPC has a much better armor
penetration profile.
Plasma Beam: With superior targeting and a smaller
energy drain than a CPC, a plasma beam sacrifices
some armor penetration.
Mag Spike Array: A storm of magnetically-accelerated
spike charges is almost guaranteed to eradicate any
fighter-class craft it hits.
Nuclear Missiles: Useless in ship-to-ship combat or
against any other TL4 planet with working nuke
snuffers, one of these missiles can still erase an
entire lostworlder city without such protection.
Spinal Beam Cannon: One of the first spinal-mount class
weapons, the SBC briefly channels the full power
of the ship into a charged beam. It lacks the power
and penetration of the more advanced gravcannon, but also takes less power to mount.

BUILDING A STARSHIP •103
Smart Cloud: A swarm of self-directed microdrones
sweeps over the ship. Their integral beam weaponry is too small to damage larger ships, but they
can wipe out an attacking fighter wave.
Gravcannon: Using much the same principles as
man-portable grav weaponry, the gravcannon
causes targets to fall apart in a welter of mutually-antagonistic gravitic fields.
Spike Inversion Projector: The SIP uses the ship’s spike
phasing as an offensive weapon, penetrating the
target with a brief incursion of MES energies that
largely ignore attempts to evade.
Vortex Tunnel Inductor: A capital-class model of the SIP,
a VTI is capable of incapacitating a cruiser in two
hits. Its bulk limits its utility against fighter-class
craft, however.
Mass Cannon: By firing projectiles almost as large as
fighter-scale craft, the mass cannon inflicts tremendous damage on a target. Serious ammunition
limitations hamper its wider-scale use.
Lightning Charge Mantle: Modulation of the ship’s
power core emits a cloak of MES lightning. While
larger spike drive craft can shunt the energies
away harmlessly, fighter-class ships are almost
invariably destroyed if hit.
Singularity Gun: One of the few surviving pretech
weapons in anything resembling wide currency,
this capital-class weapons system fires something
mathematically related to a miniaturized black
hole at a target.

Ground Weapons vs. Ships
On rare occasions, PCs will have to deal with small
arms fire against their spaceship, or evade ground
guns when trying to escape a port or land safely
on a hostile world.
As a basic rule of thumb, hostile TL3 small
arms fire does no damage, TL4 small arms fire
does 1d6 damage per ten minutes of persistent
gunfire, and Heavy weapons do half their rolled
damage, minus the ship’s Armor. Multiple Heavy
weapons blazing away at a grounded free merchant can reduce it to unflyable scrap in short
order, but a peppering of mag rifle fire is unlikely
to do serious damage to a ship that decamps with
sufficient speed.
It is impossible to miss a grounded ship. The
Armor Class of a ship in flight will vary with the
situation; AC 10 for hovering nearby, AC 15 for
close-to-earth flight, and AC 20 if the ship is simply flying within weapon range.
Active ground-placed anti-ship defenses are
a different matter. These massive lasers and energy projectors are absolutely lethal at atmospheric
ranges. Avoiding them is a Pilot skill check at a
GM-chosen difficulty of 8 to 10 for each round the
ship is exposed, suffering 2d10 damage with AP
20 on each miss. A desperate ship can get outside
the gun’s firing angle if it can survive three rounds
of this peril.

The standard drill-capable fighter craft of most TL4
polities, this model retains a spike drive instead of replacing it with a cheaper systems drive. While the lone
pilot would have to be desperate and heavily drugged
to make an entire spike drill solo, it remains an option
when no larger craft is available.
This particular model is equipped with a reaper
battery for dealing with small, lightly-armored civilian ships. “Bomber”-type fighters usually replace this
with a fractal impact charge to threaten larger warships,
while fighters built to dogfight their peers favor fitting
a multifocal laser.

This craft is a conventional civilian shuttle, albeit one
with a spike drive sufficient to get it to a neighboring
system and enough passenger space to make it a minimally-acceptable transport for brave VIPs and light
cargo. If used as an inter-system transport, however, at
least three crew will be needed to safely navigate a drill.
While cheap and flexible, the shuttle is entirely
unarmed and acutely vulnerable to piracy or hostile
warships. In such cases the pilot’s only recourse is to
surrender or hope the small craft’s nimble maneuver
drives can keep it away from the attacker long enough
to get to safety.

775K base price, 38,750 maintenance,
131,400 yearly crew cost for 3 crew

A mainstay of freebooting merchant-adventurers
throughout human space, the standard free merchant
is an extremely versatile craft, capable of hauling significant amounts of cargo to neighboring systems while
requiring very few hands to operate it. Only one crew
member is needed for in-system flight, though spike
drills require three for normal margins of safety.
The standard free merchant is not a warship, but
its sandthrower is enough to discourage pirate shuttles
and the other small or fragile craft that wreckers or
primitive worlds tend to favor. The multifocal laser
is ideal for a highly-skilled gunner who can snipe out
important systems on an attacking vessel, but the ship
lacks the armor and durability to stand up to a true warship. Of course, with a sufficiently expert crew, even a
corvette might be threatened by the well-aimed guns
of a small craft like this.

Patrol boats are often the largest ships fielded by poor
or backward frontier worlds that lack the shipyard facilities or available resources to build bigger military
craft. Even so, the ability to field two patrol boats for
the yearly maintenance cost of one corvette often appeals even to richer worlds that need more coverage
than their available craft can provide.
Patrol boats are the smallest independent warships
fielded by most navies, as fighters are not normally
considered capable of extended independent operation. They have considerable spike drive reach and are
faster in-system than most of their potential targets.
While their single mounted gun is vulnerable to being
disabled by expert enemy gunners, the relatively thick
armor of the ship and skilled damage control crew can
mitigate that danger. A few patrol boats replace their
survey sensor array with a sandthrower to up-gun the
ship, but most prefer the additional edge in scanning
potential smugglers.
The usual ship of the line of most modestly-funded
frontier navies, a corvette is a true warship, albeit of
a minimal size. While it is unable to land on worlds
with standard gravity, its cargo lighter allows crew and
cargo transit from the surface of a world, and its extended stores allow for more than four months of field
operation under normal crew parameters.
Most pirates flying reworked free merchants
or stolen patrol boats will turn tail as soon as a corvette shows up in the region. Good armor, multiple
ship-killing guns, and trained boarding marines make
a corvette a death sentence to most stellar ruffians, and
even when a pirate wolf pack can bring one down, it
usually comes at the cost of crippling damage.
The model depicted here is standard for anti-piracy and basic system defense missions. Against cruiser-class warships, however, this corvette’s weapons
have insufficient armor penetration to seriously threaten such a major warship.
Sometimes confusingly called a “light cruiser”, a heavy
frigate pushes the engineering parameters of a frigate
hull to the maximum available to most TL4 worlds.
Equipped with a torpedo launcher capable of threatening even cruiser-class enemies, the heavy frigate
can intimidate any ship of its weight class. Its heavy
crew complement and military drop pod fitting allow
it to quickly dispatch well-armed marines to hot spots
throughout a solar system.
However, despite the large weapon loadout, the
heavy frigate remains a frigate. Its armor is significantly inferior to that of a true cruiser-class warship, and
most frigates built for same-class engagements can be
a meaningful threat to it. It comes into its own as a
bludgeon against the other small warships likely to be
fielded by a peer star-faring polity.

Found only in rich, peaceful regions of space, the bulk
freighter is capable of hauling thousands of tons of
goods between star systems. While it’s equipped with
enough of a sting to discourage small-ship piracy, it’s
woefully inadequate to handle a warship, or even an
up-gunned free merchant.
Some adventurers do find use for a bulk freighter
hull, however, trading off some of its massive cargo
space for more fittings and using customized modifications to allow the ship to support heavier power
demands. While the end result is no match for a true
cruiser, the sheer mass of the freighter can make it a
dangerous opponent in the right hands.

The archetypal warship of post-Silence humanity, the
fleet cruiser is a ship-eating monster compared to its
smaller brethren in the navy. Only prosperous polities
can build such powerful ships, and even they sometimes find it more practical to have a flexible fleet of
small craft rather than a few heavily-armed cruisers.
The chief advantage of a fleet cruiser is in its heavily-armored hull. Only special hunter-killer ships fitted
with armor-piercing weaponry have any real chance of
penetrating the cruiser’s thick skin. Those weapons are
almost always more bulky and power-hungry than their
peer weapons, so enemy polities must usually choose
between building small ships that are very effective at
defeating other small ships, or building hunter-killers
that can threaten cruisers but are at a disadvantage
against their less specialized brethren.

Built off the biggest hull class that TL4 polities can

worlds with adequate resources to do so often balk at
expending such a tremendous amount of money on a
single ship.
Those that do build battleships do so for a reason.
The tremendous weight of fire these ships put out can
pop a cruiser in a single firing pass, and its reinforced
hull plating shrugs off all but the heaviest armor-piercing blows. Where cruisers often require hunter-killer
frigates to take them out, battleships commonly require
hunter-killer cruisers to disable them.
The main weakness of a battleship is the fact that it
is only a single ship… a single, extremely expensive ship.
It can only attack or defend a single location at a time,
and an enemy that has the time and resources to build
specialized anti-capital ships with AP weaponry and
expendable crews can bring the battleship down for far
less money than it cost to build it.

Building a Ship
A fortunate adventurer has won the favor of a powerful shipping magnate, and has earned one million
credits worth of astronautic work. The player thinks
it’s an excellent chance to have a ship built to fit the
adventuring party’s needs.
She starts by looking over the ship hulls and
quickly sees that a free merchant hull is the best she
can afford. A shuttle hull might work, but such a
ship is too fragile for her liking. The hull itself costs
500,000 credits and comes with a drive-1 spike drive.
It also has free Power and Mass scores of 10 and
15 respectively. The player can fill that space with
fittings and defenses as she wishes.
First, she looks at weaponry. She wants enough
firepower to discourage small ships, but she can’t
mount weapons that require a cruiser or capital hull,
and a plasma beam is far too expensive. She could
settle for a multifocal laser, which is cheap, but she
decides to up-gun to a fractal impact charge, trusting
in the party’s Warrior to aim it well. It costs 200k
credits, 5 power, 1 mass, and 1 free hardpoint. It can
store up to 8 charges in the launcher since a frigate-class hull is one larger than the minimum needed
to mount it. The charges themselves will cost her
another 4,000 credits.

Next, she thinks about better engines. She briefly considers a drive-3 upgrade, but it would take 4
points of Power and Mass, leaving her almost no
Power left for other fittings. She settles for a drive-2
upgrade for 100k credits, 2 Power, and 2 Mass.
She takes a moment to think about adding some
hardened polyceramic overlay to the merchant as a
defense, but the ship’s Armor is so low that it doesn’t
seem worth the effort to harden it.
The PCs will need to land, so she adds an atmospheric configuration at 50k and 2 Mass. She wants
fuel scoops so she doesn’t have to trust to local refueling stations, so that’s 50k, 2 Power, and 2 Mass. Prudence recommends a fuel bunker in case she needs
to drill out before refueling, adding 25k and 1 Mass.
She’s so far spent 929,000 credits, 9 Power, and
8 Mass. To spare bookkeeping, she puts in a ship’s
locker for 25k, but an armory is too expensive; the
PCs will just have to track their own weapons and
ammo. The remaining Mass is turned into 140 tons
of cargo space. Thus, the final ship costs 954,000
credits and uses 9 Power, and 15 Mass. At a rate of
25,000 credits of shipyard work a day, it’ll take the
yards about 39 days to build, giving the party time to
think about how they’ll pay for maintenance…

The queen of every navy that has one, a carrier is the
pinnacle of TL4 shipbuilding technology and a massive credit sink for any polity rich or desperate enough
to build one. Every fully-equipped carrier holds more
firepower than most modern navies can assemble, and
a single carrier is more than enough to crush most TL4
naval task forces.
The carrier itself is only the vector for its tremendous payload of ships, both small fighters and corvette-type daughter craft. The ability to quickly alter
the flight wings of a carrier allows a rich planet to tailor
its loadout to the specific needs of a campaign, whether it’s destroying the interstellar commerce and asteroid mines of an enemy polity or going head-to-head
against their cruiser line of battle. Many polities further
optimize their carrier-loaded ships by removing their
spike drives and replacing them with system drives, relying on the carrier to get them into position. Of course,
if the mothership is destroyed in hostile territory, these
orphans are doomed.
While a carrier has a belly full of death, the ship
itself is lightly gunned and has significantly weaker
armor than its battleship brethren. Any polity rich
enough to build a carrier knows well enough to equip
it with an escort of other ships to screen it from hostile attentions. Lightly-armed as it is, a wing of fighter-bombers can leave it a burning hulk if it’s caught out
without protection.

108• MODIFYING AND TUNING STARSHIPS

MODIFYING AND TUNING STARSHIPS
Most ships are maintained in the condition they came
from the shipyard, with the crew and the engineers
working to keep things aligned with the shipwright’s
specifications. Such rigid conformity with standard
techniques ensures easy repair, cheap maintenance, and
the ready ability to switch crews without requiring laborious retraining or familiarization. Not all engineers
value these qualities so highly, however, and some prefer to install their own improvements.
A ship’s engineer can alter the wiring, internal
structure, or other specifications of a starship, either
to improve overall performance or make tradeoffs that
are useful to their needs. Making these modifications
isn’t cheap, and they often require the strategic deployment of rare pretech ship components.
Engineers with sufficiently vast resources, shipyard access, and available pretech components can
completely re-engineer a ship to integrate their improvements in the basic hull structure. These improvements no longer require their special attention to keep
them operational, allowing the engineer to focus on
other modifications or allow less talented crewmen to
keep the ship in fighting trim.

Mods and Maintenance

Every engineer has a Maintenance score, the same used
for installing equipment mods as described on page 90.
The score is equal to their Intelligence modifier plus
their Constitution modifier plus three times their Fix
score. Any mod maintenance is counted against this
Maintenance score, whether for equipment or starships.
An engineer can maintain a number of mods at
once equal to their Maintenance score. If a ship mod
is neglected for one week of active use, it breaks down.
Any fittings or functions dependent on the mod also
become inoperable until a sufficiently skilled engineer
spends at least 8 hours repairing the mod, a process
which requires time but no significant additional parts.
Ships parked at a station or landing strip don’t count
as “active” for this purpose, so the ship’s engineer can
go off for a week’s adventure or shore leave without
returning to a broken-down starship.
More than one engineer can work to maintain a
ship’s modifications, provided the maintenance officer
has a Fix skill score as high as that needed to install the
mod in the first place. This also assumes that the chief
engineer and any assistants work together closely to
properly teach the structure and quirks of the modification. The difficulty of maintaining this close teamwork
and sourcing exotic parts to maintain a non-standard
modification is one reason why very few NPC ships
have mods. While they’re possible for elite craft and
idiosyncratic prototypes, most military ships or corporate traders have too much of a logistical burden to
support these odd alterations.

Installing Mods

Every starship mod requires a certain amount of refitting work and after-market parts, along with a potential need for one or more pretech components. These
pretech components are not normally for sale, and are
usually found only through salvage during adventuring or as rewards for favors performed for important
personages. While they vary in structure and appearance, for convenience’s sake it’s assumed that a given
component can serve in installing any mod.
Building the mod can be done at a rate of one day’s
work for the crew per 5,000 credits in mod cost, or
one day per 25,000 credits if a shipyard’s services are
available. Mods can also be torn out, a process taking
less than a day that reclaims any pretech components
used in their construction but wastes any credit investment in parts.
Mod installation does not require a full shipyard,
but it does assume the full crew of the ship is assisting
the engineer in stripping components, welding in new
fittings, and hauling heavy parts. A lone engineer can’t
make mods to anything larger than a frigate-class hull,
and that might take a week’s painstaking labor for every
5,000 credits of cost.

Redesigning Ships

An engineer with vast amounts of money, components,
and shipyard support can completely rebuild a ship hull
to include a mod as part of its basic structure, or redesign an existing hull schematic to include the mod.
This is much more expensive than a quick after-market
addition, but the mod becomes part of the basic ship
itself and requires no further Maintenance.
To rebuild a ship with a mod, the engineer must
spend five times the usual cost in credits and twice as
many pretech components as usually required by the
mod. A shipyard is mandatory for such extensive redesign, and can do the work at a rate of 25,000 credits
worth each day.
To build an entirely new hull that includes the mod
as part of its design, only the normal price of the mod
must be paid in credits and components. By integrating
the modification into the ship’s basic blueprints, the
engineer makes it much easier to install and maintain
it. Of course, the entire hull must then be built from
scratch at a shipyard, also at the usual rate of 25,000
credits of work done per day.
There’s a limit to the amount of flexibility an engineer has in such designs, however. A ship can only be
rebuilt or redesigned with a number of mods equal to
twice the engineer’s Fix skill score. Further mods can
be bolted on afterwards, but these will require Maintenance to keep in operating order, just as with any
other mod.

MODIFYING AND TUNING STARSHIPS •109

Example Starship Mods

The following modifications aren’t the only alterations
that a canny engineer can install on a starship, but
they’re among the most common. Each one is listed
with the minimum Fix skill required to install or maintain the mod.
The credit price for most is expressed in a percent of the base hull cost; thus, to install a power trunk
streamlining mod with a 10% cost in a free merchant
hull would cost 50,000 credits, or 10% the cost of the
base hull. In a battleship hull, that same mod would
cost 6,000,000 credits.
The pretech component cost is given in components per hull class. Thus, if a mod requires one component per hull class, it would take one component for
a fighter-class hull, two for a frigate, three for a cruiser,
and four for a capital-class hull. These pretech components are usually rare and restricted enough that they
cannot be purchased on the open market. PCs need
to find them during their adventures, acquire them
through favors to powerful persons, or intentionally
seek them out in salvage adventures.
Most mods can be installed only once, though a
few of them labeled otherwise can be duplicated as far
as the ship’s infrastructure can support them.
Cargo Efficiency Bays (Fix-1): The ship’s internal structure is adjusted to optimize available cargo space.
The ship’s total free Mass is decreased by 10%,
rounded up, but, each point of Mass dedicated to
cargo space counts as two points. Cost: 10% of hull,
1 component/hull class
Compact Magazines (Fix-1): The ship can carry twice
as much ammunition as its available weapons and
magazine space would normally allow. Cost: 5%
of hull, no components
Drill Velocity Upgrade (Fix-2): The ship’s spike drive
is counted as one level better when determining
spike drill transit speed and maximum drill range,
up to a maximum of drive-6. Cost: 10% of hull, 1
component/hull class
Emergency Drill Activation (Fix-3): The ship can engage
its spike drives even when in dangerous proximity
to a planetary body. When engaged, it can drill out
in a single round. Doing so increases the difficulty
of any spike drive skill check by +2 if in-system or
+4 if actually landed. Drilling out from the surface
will destroy everything within 200 meters of the
ship. The mod can be used only once every four
weeks. Cost: 20% hull, 2 components/hull class
Emergency Thruster Boost (Fix-1): Retune the engines
for emergency power. Once per space combat,
gain a +2 bonus to Speed for three rounds. Cost:
10% of hull, no components
Engine Optimization (Fix-2): The engines have been
optimized for realspace maneuverability. The
ship’s Speed increases by 1. Cost: 10% of hull, 1
component/hull class

Eternal Reactor (Fix-2): The ship’s fuel tanks are replaced with effectively everlasting pretech energy
cores. It no longer needs to refuel for drills or operation. Cost: 5% of hull, 2 components/hull class
Extended Mass Support (Fix-1): The engineer trims back
the power core to allow for more ship mass. Lose
up to ten points of free Power; gain half as many
points of free Mass, rounded down. This mod can
be installed multiple times. Cost: 10% of hull, one
component
Low Emissions (Fix-1): Any sensor checks to detect the
ship have their difficulty increased by +2. Cost:
10% of hull, 1 component/hull class
Nemesis Tracker (Fix-3): The ship’s targeting computers are augmented with pretech prediction software. Once per ship combat, a gunner on the ship
can take an Instant action to cause a weapon shot
to hit, regardless of the hit roll. Cost: 5% of hull, 2
components/hull class
Oversized Mountings (Fix-2): Choose a specific weapon
or fitting that normally requires a hull size one
step larger than the ship the mod is installed on.
The ship can mount that fitting. Cost: 15% of hull,
1 component/hull size
Power Trunk Streamlining (Fix-1): Sacrifice free hull
space for superior power core efficiency. Lose up
to five points of free Mass; gain twice as many
points of free Power. This mod can be installed
multiple times. Cost: 10% of hull, one component
Q-Ship Cladding (Fix-1): Some or all of ship’s weapons
are concealed from external observation and standard scans when they are not deployed for combat.
The ship itself can be made to look like a merchant
or freighter of its size class. Cost: 5% of hull, no
components
Regenerative Armor (Fix-3): The ship’s Armor score
increases by 5 points. Cost: 15% of hull, 2 components/hull class
Reinforced Armor (Fix-1): The ship’s Armor score increases by the Fix skill of the installing engineer.
The ship loses one point of Power and one point
of Mass. Cost: 5% of hull
Specialized Mountings (Fix-1): Choose a specific weapon
or fitting when this mod is installed. The chosen
fitting requires only half the normal Power and
Mass per fitting installation, rounded down to a
minimum of 1. Cost: 10% of hull, no components
Volley Capacitors (Fix-2): The ship’s weaponry has been
altered for rapid firing. Once per combat, the
ship’s gunner gets 4 Command Points that must
be spent on gunnery actions. Cost: 10% of hull,
no components
Weapon Overcharge (Fix-2): One weapon of the engineer’s choice has been overcharged. It requires
50% more Power than a usual installation, but
rolls its damage twice and takes the better result
each time. This mod may be installed more than
once. Cost: 5% of hull, no components

110• SPACE TRAVEL

SPACE TRAVEL
Interstellar travel takes place through metadimensional
space, a higher-order continuum “understood” by only
a handful of brilliant researchers and astronautic engineers. Fortunately, it is not necessary to have an intuitive understanding of the place in order to operate
a spike drive starship. While modern postech spike
drives are neither as powerful nor as efficient as the
exquisite creations of the Terran Mandate, most TL4
worlds can still put together the necessary components
to get a ship from one stellar system to another.
Within the gravity well created by a stellar body, a
spike drive provides sub-light propulsion sufficient to
get the ship to most system locations within a few days
at most. Only at the edge of a solar system, where the
gravitic influence of the star dwindles away to almost
nothing, can the spike drive be fully engaged to catapult the ship into metadimensional space. This gravitic
transition zone is critical for providing the necessary
step-up and step-down for a spike drive. Without such
a transition, a ship can neither climb into metadimensional space nor come down from those elevated dimensional frequencies. Only a star is sufficient to provide enough of a gravitic gradient; random interstellar
rocks and debris don’t exert enough of an influence to
form a usable transition zone.
Ships are generally unable to “overshoot” a transition zone. If a ship is coming into a system from a spike
drive course to the stellar northwest of the star, it will
appear at the northwest edge of the solar system. Its
pilot can’t choose to “overshoot” that region, traveling
across the solar system to come down on the southeastern edge of the star’s transition zone. This property
allows a solar system’s owner to fortify probable transit
paths into the system, placing defenses and picket ships
in the path of likely arrivals.
This can be a difficult and expensive process if the
star is in a crowded stellar neighborhood. The transit
paths from each potential destination are different; if
a star has two other systems to its east, it has to fortify
two different arrival zones if it wants to be confident
of detecting incoming ships from both stars. If an exceptionally powerful spike drive allows an intruder to
drill in from a more-distant star, the local polity might
have no local sensors at all in the region, having never
anticipated that a ship might come directly from such
a distant location.
These relatively-fixed arrival zones only apply
to ships arriving at a star. A ship can leave from any
location on the rim, traveling toward any destination
within reach of its spike drive. Thus, a ship that’s able
to skulk past a system’s frontier sensors can usually find
an empty region of space in the transition zone to skip
out undetected. It also has no obligation to be on the
“correct side” of the star to go leaping off toward a particular stellar destination.

Making Spike Drills

Interstellar spike drills are dangerous. Some sectors
have the technology and friendly-enough metadimensional weather to make standard drill paths relatively
safe for travel. Ships in these favored sectors can move
between connected worlds with no significant chance
of disaster. Other sectors are not so fortunate, nor are
those ships that must forge through uncharted metadimensional space to reach their destination. Careless
navigation or sheer bad luck can result in these ships
being snuffed out by an unexpected surge of metadimensional energy or lost in the storms of hyperdimensional space.
To make a successful spike drill, the target system
must be within range. A spike drive has a hex range
equal to its rating; a drive-3 can reach a star three hexes
away on the sector map. Note that these sector maps
are abstractions rather than strict 2D maps. A star three
hexes away might be a vast distance away, but connected by a friendly stretch of metadimensional space. Conversely, an “empty” adjacent hex might have a star in
it, but it’s surrounded by killing waves of impenetrable
dimensional disruption. Because of this, conventional astronomical mapping isn’t overly useful to transit.
The astronomers might know that there’s a star only a
few light years away, but if the navigators can’t find a
metadimensional path to it, it might as well be on the
far side of the galaxy.
A spike drill requires one load of fuel. Most ships
can hold a single load of fuel at any one time. All can
be refueled from the appropriate refineries or starport
tending services, while others can use fuel scoop fittings to refuel from a star or gas giant. Other ships
have fuel bunkers that can hold more than one load of
fuel, for quick double-drills when speed is vital. Normal
intra-system maneuvering uses no significant amount
of fuel, and refueling costs a flat 500 credits per load.
A spike drill requires time. A safe drill procedure
requires half an hour to enter metadimensional space,
though this process can be rushed at greater risk. The
transit time is six days per hex traveled, divided by the
spike drill rating. Thus, a drive-3 crossing two hexes
would take four days, while a drive-1 moving to an
adjacent hex would take six days. Daring navigators
can “trim the course”, accepting greater risks in transit
in order to increase their effective drive rating by 1 for
purposes of determining the speed of travel, though
this bonus doesn’t increase the drive’s maximum range.
A spike drill needs a course record, or “rutter” to
guide the pilot. Ideally, this is an up-to-date and recent
record of the metadimensional currents and energetic
weather between the origin and destination of their
course, one reported by a recent traveler. The older and
staler the readings of the rutter, the more dangerous

SPACE TRAVEL •111
the drill. Most rutters for commonly-traveled routes
are freely available, and significant trade corridors
usually have ones only a few days old available to any
pilot making the drill. Rutters charting heretofore-unknown paths between stars are often kept jealously secret by their owners, and may require an adventure or
a favor to obtain.
Attempting to drill to a star without any rutter
at all is insanely dangerous, the work of near-suicidal
crew of adventurers willing to risk everything in order
to obtain a secret route to some hopefully-unplundered
world. Only a masterful interstellar navigator has any
real hope of surviving such a blind drill.
Finally, a spike drill needs a pilot. Only a human
or other sentient-grade intellect is capable of dealing
with the dangerously unpredictable perils of metadimensional space, as expert systems and other “dumb”
robots simply can’t handle the random dangers. Most
ships require at least three crew members to cover all
the bridge watches necessary, though only one of these
crew needs to be an actual pilot. In desperate circumstances, a lone pilot can use drugs to stay awake for as
much as a week in order to single-handedly steer a ship
to its destination.
If all these ingredients are in place and the ship
is at the edge of the solar system, a ship’s navigator
can make an Int/Pilot skill check to make a successful
spike drill, the process taking 30 minutes. If rushed,
it takes only one ship combat round to execute. The
base difficulty is 7, modified by the available rutter, the
distance drilled, rushed procedures, and whether or not
the navigator is trimming the course to speed up the
transit. If the final difficulty is 6 or less, the drill is too
safe and simple to have any risk of failure.

Intra-System Travel

Traveling inside a solar system is much safer and more
rapid than interstellar travel. Barring unusual perils or
mechanical failure, such journeys can be made without
Pilot skill checks or risk of dramatic mishaps.
For convenience, space within a solar system is
broken up in regions. Each region is simply a place of
interest within the system; planets are regions, fortified
arrival zones are regions, particular pirate lairs in the
asteroid belts are regions, and so forth. Any particular
place of interest and its satellite areas can be treated as
a single region.
The base travel time for moving inside a region is
six hours. Thus, in six hours a ship could travel from a
planetary starport to a site on the planet’s moon, or to
a distant science station orbiting around the planet, or
to a distress beacon in space near that world. Any place
within that region can be reached within six hours, or
faster at the GM’s discretion.
The base travel time for moving between regions
is forty-eight hours. A ship in orbit around one planet
could thus travel to an entirely different planet, or to
the transition zone at the rim of the system, or to a
ship detected deep within system space, or to an asteroid pirate base, or to any other point of interest in the
solar system.
Base travel time is divided by the ship’s spike drive
rating. Thus, a ship with drive-3 could reach another
region in the system in only 16 hours. Bold navigators
can “trim the course” to increase their effective spike
drive rating by 1 by making a successful Pilot check at
difficulty 9. On a failure, the travel actually takes twice
as long as usual.

If the roll fails, something has gone wrong on
the drill, and a roll on the failed navigation results are
necessary. These mishaps don’t normally result in the
summary death of the crew, but they often force the
navigator to make emergency course changes or drill
exits that might leave the ship in a dangerously unfriendly region of space.

SENSORS AND DETECTION
Adventurers often find it necessary to be very discreet
about their comings and goings within a solar system,
as do pirates, hostile warships, smugglers, and other
nefarious sorts. Space is wide and dark, and if a ship is
careful to avoid inhabited regions it can often escape
notice by a system’s inhabitants.

Hiding and Seeking

As a general matter it is very difficult to spot a ship in
deep space when it doesn’t wish to be spotted. Once a
ship’s energy signature is identified, however, it becomes much easier to follow the ship’s movement; such
a positional fix is called a detection lock, and once a ship
has been locked by an observer it can be tracked at any
distance in the system.
Fixing a lock on a target requires the observer to
be in the same region of space and to win an opposed
Int/Program skill check against the ship’s comms officer. If the observer wins the opposed roll, they get a
detection lock on the ship. If they lose or tie, they remain oblivious to the ship’s presence and can try again
in 24 hours. The active sensors used to form a detection
lock can be detected by the target; they know they’ve
been made. If the observing ship uses passive sensors,
the lock is undetectable, but it’s more difficult to obtain.
The observer takes bonuses and penalties to their
opposed skill check based on the circumstances as listed
below. This can alter their die roll substantially, and
make concealment almost impossible for ships not
specially equipped for stealth. The modifiers below are
common ones, but particular regions of space may have
their own hazards or complications, with some making
detection so difficult that they become favorite lairs for
pirates and malcontents.

The larger the ship, the better the sensors it will
have, but the easier it is to spot it in space. Minor outposts would reflect small deep-space habs or listening
posts, while major space stations would include most
military stations and other significant fortifications.
Ships that carefully avoid population centers when
landing on a world can mitigate some of the danger of
a planetary sensor network, leaving smugglers and pirates to prefer landing in remote, little-inhabited areas.

To break a lock, a tracked ship needs to leave the
region. As soon as it does, the observer and the ship
repeat their opposed skill check. If the observer wins,
it continues to track the ship, while a tie or loss means
the ship slips the lock. Any observers in the destination
region can attempt to pick up the ship immediately and
then once every 24 hours, but the original observer is
out of luck. Provided a ship is willing to escape to the
region of deep space above or below the solar ecliptic,
it’s extremely unlikely that there’ll be anything there to
spot them. Of course, such escape also means staying
clear of potential refuges. A ship that flees to the “edge
of the system” region can drill out to safety from there,
and unless they pick a chunk of the rim monitored
by the locals, they can do so with impunity. Very few
worlds can monitor the entire system perimeter.
When rolling for observation, only roll once for
any given group, outpost, or planet, using the best
modifiers available. Thus, if a battle squadron including a cruiser and three frigates rolls to observe, the
GM would use the skill bonus and +2 modifier for the
cruiser’s crew. If a separate pirate ship was in the same
region, the GM would roll for them as well, because
they’re a separate force in the region.

Pursuit and Escape

Adventurers have a habit of drawing unfriendly attention from hostile ships. While escape from a combat
engagement is a matter of maneuver jets and good piloting, long-range chases rely more on a ship’s spike
drives to provide raw motive power.
A pursuer must be in the same region of space to
pursue and must have a detection lock. Of course, if the
pursued lacks a detection lock on the pursuer, they’ll
have no idea that they’re being chased.
Both ships make Int/Pilot opposed skill checks,
each adding their spike drive rating to the roll. If the
pursuer wins or ties, they force an engagement and
the ships are moved into combat range. If the pursued
ship wins, it gets six hours of distance, modified by any
difference in spike drive ratings; a drive-1 ship being
chased by a drive-2 ship would have three hours, for
example. It can use this time to reach a particular point
inside the region, or can put it toward an attempt to
escape the region entirely. Ships with spike drive-1 engines need 48 hours to enter a new region, so they are
unlikely to avoid a determined pursuer; one with spike
drive-3, on the other hand, can make the escape in only
16 hours. Some pilots may attempt to speed this up by
trimming their course.
A pursuing ship can also use this six hours to aim
toward a different region, if it thinks it knows where
the ship is running. Assuming they can keep the detection lock when the pursued ship slips over the sub-stellar border, they can end up close on their prey’s heels.

SENSORS AND DETECTION •113

Scanning Planets and Ships

Short-range scans of ships and planetary objects are relatively simple affairs. Any scan of a ship within combat
range will reveal the ship’s hull type, obvious weaponry
and damage, and registered ID code. A scan of a planet
in orbit will always reveal basic information on atmosphere, geology, advanced energy-using surface communities, other ships in orbit, and any surface features
designed to attract orbital interest.
Comms officers can attempt to interrogate the
scans, asking one question before rolling an Int/Program skill check against difficulty 8. On a success, the
question is answered, while a failure means that the
data is inconclusive and no further questions can be
asked of it that day. Each question after the first success that same day is asked at a cumulative +1 difficulty
modifier. Questions should be simple and direct.
When scanning a ship, a comms officer might
ask whether particular fittings or weapons have been

MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR
Ships are expensive things to keep flying, and many
adventuring crews find themselves taking somewhat
dubious work just to get enough money to keep their
ship in the air.

Spares, Repairs and Refueling

Most ships have their repairs and maintenance done at
a shipyard, but a ship can perform field maintenance
and repair if they have the necessary parts. One ton of
cargo space can hold 10,000 credits worth of spare parts.
Any time required is quadrupled, however.
Ship fuel costs a flat 500 credits per load.

Six-Month Maintenance

Every ship needs to spend 5% of its total non-crew cost
every six months in order to pay for basic maintenance.
Each such period that is skipped applies a -1 penalty to
all ship skill checks and hit rolls. At -4, the ship gains a
10% chance per month of breaking down entirely until
backlogged maintenance is repaired. At a shipyard, this
maintenance takes a day for a fighter hull, a week for a
frigate or cruiser, and a month for a capital ship.

Repairing Hulls and Systems

Fixing ship hit points can be done at a cost of 1,000
credits per point, with up to the presiding engineer’s
Fix skill repaired in points each day. A disabled system can be jury-rigged back to functionality for onetenth the system’s cost and one day’s work per 25,000
credits so spent. A jury-rigged system that is disabled
again is destroyed. Full repairs of a disabled system cost
one-quarter of its original price.
Repairs made during combat do not need to be
re-done or paid for afterwards, as they were performed
before the damage could become critical and lasting.

mounted, where good boarding points might be on the
hull, whether the ship looks to be the product of a particular world or culture, or simply to question whether anything looks odd about the ship’s readings. The
sensors can probe a meter or so beneath the hull skin,
but they can’t intrude on a ship’s computer network or
provide a map of interior spaces.
When scanning a planet, a comms officer can ask
about apparent capitals or spaceports, major industrial
sites, unusual planetary weather patterns, unique allergens or atmospheric hazards, current local news transmissions, or identify hidden or low-tech communities
that are large but do not have clear energy signatures.
If they have the Survey Sensor Array fitting, they
can do orbital visual spying accurate enough to read
newsprint, in addition to asking questions about subterranean spaces, visible surface life forms of interest,
crude maps of the interior spaces, and interesting energy readings.

Sneaking In
The free merchant Grendel has just drilled into a
new system using charts her captain stole from an
unfortunate pirate.
As it happens, a small pirate base is positioned
in the region, placed there by its inhabitants to
keep an eye on any traffic from the adjacent system. They get a chance to detect the Grendel, and
roll the pirate comm officer’s skill bonus of +2 plus
another +2 for being a minor outpost, and a -2
for using passive sensors to avoid alerting targets.
Their total is 12. The Grendel’s comms officer is
good, however, and gets a +2 for being a frigate-class ship. His Int/Program skill roll is a 13,
meaning the base has not detected the ship.
Now the free merchant gets a chance to spot
the station, also using passive sensors at a -2 penalty. The outpost is a very visible space station, and
takes -2 on its opposed roll, while the frigate gains
a +1 on its check. The base rolls a 7 and the Grendel
rolls an 8. The frigate has a detection lock on the
pirate base.
Her captain decides to sneak further into the
system. She can’t be sure the station hasn’t spotted
her, but it’s made no obvious sign of it and she
wants to investigate the local planets and their inhabitants. The Grendel’s drive-2 engine can cross
over to a planet’s region with 24 hours of travel.
This will give the station one more chance
to lock the ship, since it can try again in 24 hours.
Even if it does successfully lock the free merchant,
however, the captain bets they can lose it when
they transfer out of the solar region. The pirate
base might broadcast an alert to any other local allies, however, which could make things awkward.

114• SPACE COMBAT

SPACE COMBAT
The clash of ships in the void, the flash of silent explosions and soundless death… these things are familiar to interstellar adventurers, and a natural hazard of
the profession. While most adventurers seek to avoid
such hull-melting conflagrations of war, sometimes the
choice is not their own. When two or more ships close
to combat range with the intent to kill, it’s time to fight.

The Combat Round

Space combat begins with a normal initiative roll, one
made by each ship involved in the combat. Each rolls
1d8 modified by the Intelligence or Dexterity modifier
of the pilot, and they take their turns in order, with
PCs winning ties. Once every ship has had a turn, the
round starts over from the top. Initiative is not rerolled.
A round of ship combat takes about 15 minutes, but
Experts and Warriors can only use their special class
abilities to reroll skill checks or ensure automatic hits
once per engagement.
On its turn, a ship’s captain decides in which order
its various departments will act: bridge, gunnery, engineering, comms, and captain. Each department then
chooses actions, choosing either from their specific
department or a general action available to all departments. A department head can choose actions from
only one category; they can’t pick from both. Some of
these actions generate Command Points, allowing other
departments to spend these points taking actions that
require them. When all departments have acted, the
next ship in order can go.
If the ship is an NPC ship, the GM can abbreviate the process, giving it a fixed number of Command
Points based on its general crew quality, with the ship
being able to take whatever actions it needs using that
total. Fighters and civilian ships usually have 4 Command Points, military or pirate ships have 5, native
spacers and highly-trained warships have 6, and the
finest NPC crews in space can muster 7 points.

Ship Departments

For purposes of interstellar combat, every ship is assumed to have five departments: bridge, gunnery, engineering, comms, and captain. A ship with too few
crew to actually man these departments may have to
double-up on staffing, but these five functions are the
ones that are critical during space combat, and every
ship has to be able to act on them.
The bridge is where the ship’s piloting and navigation is done. This might be no more than the cramped
cockpit of a starfighter or it might be a cavernous central control node in the bowels of a battleship. The
bridge department handles attempts to escape combat,
perform evasive maneuvers, or pursue a fleeing enemy.
The gunnery department is in charge of the ship’s
weaponry. If it’s used to blow pieces out of something

unfriendly, it’s in the charge of the gunners who man
this department. They’re the ones who fire a ship’s guns
and make the targeting calculations necessary to snipe
specific systems and weapons on a hostile target.
Engineering keeps the ship flying when enemies
are carving chunks out of her hull. They can perform
damage control, boost the engines to speed a ship’s maneuvers, and execute emergency repairs to get a damaged system back online before it’s too late.
The comms department doesn’t just handle inter-ship communications, but it also manages sensors,
electronic warfare, and combat hacking duties. Their
crew can baffle enemy targeting attempts, fool hostile
sensors, and choke enemy computers with ECM.
The captain is master of the ship and directs the
other departments. On a warship, this discipline might
be taut and automatic. On a ship piloted by PCs, obedience may be less certain. Regardless, the captain can
boost the effectiveness of other departments, direct
crew for perilous but necessary tasks, or convert otherwise-crippling hits into more manageable crises.
For player-run ships, every PC should be put in
charge of one of these departments, preferably the one
that best suits their character’s skills. If a PC is totally
incompetent for space combat, they can be given temporary control of the NPC officer who actually is in
charge of the department, and can run that NPC as
their character during the fight. If the ship is so small
that there is no NPC available to run the department,
then the PC is treated as a supernumerary officer, and
can only take actions from the general action list available to all departments.
Sometimes there are fewer PCs than there are departments. In that case, double-up the duties of two
or more departments on a single PC. That PC can
still only take actions from one departments per turn;
any departments they don’t take an action from are
assumed to use the Do Your Duty action, adding 1 Command Point to the ship’s available total. Thus, if a PC
was in charge of both the bridge and the comms, she
could take actions either from the bridge list, the comms list, or the general list of actions. If she didn’t pick
any action from the bridge or comms list, the neglected
department would simply use Do Your Duty to add +1
Command Point to the ship’s available total. For a single-seat fighter, the lone crewman might have all five
departments on his head. Such a pilot would be able to
take actions from any single department each round
with the other four providing 4 Command Points to
fuel that action.
Sometimes the PCs may want to swap departments in mid-battle for some reason, or to replace a
department head who has been incapacitated. They
may do so at the start of any given combat turn provided that the department heads involved do not object.

SPACE COMBAT •115

Actions and Command Points

At the start of every ship’s turn, the captain decides the
order in which the departments will take their action.
In the chaos of combat, she can give directions to the
heads, but they are not obligated to follow them.
When a department’s turn comes up, the PC in
charge chooses actions, either from their department
list or the general action list. Some actions may require skill checks to execute properly, while others are
automatically successful. Some actions may require
Command Points to be spent in order to attempt them,
while others give Command Points. A few prohibit the
PC from doing any other action that round.
Barring these actions, a department head can take
as many actions as they have Command Points to spend
on them. A gunnery chief with 4 Command Points, for
example, could use the Fire One Weapon action twice,
spending 2 Command Points each time, or he could
use the Fire All Guns action once, spending 3 Command
Points and leaving 1 left. The department head does not
need to get permission to spend points from the rest of
the crew; if he decides to burn the points to open fire
when the rest of the crew wanted him to save them,
that’s too bad for the rest of the crew. A traitorous or
uncooperative department head can only be stopped
by PC intervention with the Deal With a Crisis action.
After every department has acted, all excess Command Points are lost. Ships normally start their turns
with 0 Command Points.

Attacks and Damage

When a ship fires a weapon, it can choose any target
involved in the combat. Either the gunnery department
head, an NPC, or a nominated PC may make the attack,
but a given gunner can man only one gun a round. The
gunnery head is always the one to spend Command
Points to fire, but their nominees may be the ones actually manning the guns and rolling the attacks.
The gunner rolls a normal hit roll, using their
base attack bonus plus the better of their Intelligence
or Dexterity mods, plus their Shoot skill. If flying a
fighter-class ship, Pilot may be used in place of Shoot.
Foci that normally give bonuses to Shoot attacks, such
as Gunslinger, do not apply to ship combat unless specifically noted as doing so. The luck ability of the Warrior
class may be used once per fight to hit with ship guns,
but cannot be used to negate a hit against their ship.
If the hit roll equals or exceeds the target ship’s
Armor Class, the attack is a success and the attacker
may roll damage, again modified by the better of the
gunner’s Intelligence or Dexterity modifiers. This damage is lessened by the target’s Armor score, which may
in turn be negated by a gun’s Armor-Piercing quality.
A successful hit by a plasma beam, for example, does
3d6 damage plus the gunner’s attribute modifier, with
an Armor Piercing quality of 10. Against a free merchant with an Armor score of 2, the full damage of the
beam gets through, as the AP 10 cancels out all the
merchant’s Armor.

116• SPACE COMBAT
Armor can negate all damage from a hit if it’s
strong enough. If Armor completely negates the attack,
the hit cannot disable systems.
Sufficiently skilled gunners can use the Target System action to aim a shot at a particular weapon system,
engine, or other fitting that seems vulnerable to the
GM. On such a hit, the damage is halved, rounded up,
before Armor is applied. If any damage gets through,
that system is disabled and cannot be used until it is
repaired. Engines lose one drive rank instead, so that
a drive-2 spike drive becomes a drive-1 until repaired.
Disabled systems hit again or drives reduced below
drive-0 are destroyed, and cannot be repaired during
combat. A ship with destroyed engines cannot perform
any bridge actions and may be boarded at an attacking
ship’s leisure, assuming its guns are also disabled.
If a ship is reduced to zero hit points, fighter-class
hulls are instantly destroyed with all hands. Larger
ships are mortally damaged. Such crippled ships can
take no action and will explode within 2d6 minutes
unless the chief engineer succeeds in an Int/Fix skill
check against difficulty 10. On a failure, the explosion is
inevitable, while on a success the ship merely becomes
a burnt-out hulk with all systems destroyed. If sufficiently vast amounts of repair supplies are still intact in
the hold, a determined crew might be able to jury-rig
the maimed ship into temporary operation.

Ship Crises

Instead of accepting some particularly gruesome hit or
disabling attack, a PC ship can instead choose to accept
a Crisis. The attack or the disabling hit is then negated,
with no damage done. Instead, the GM rolls on the
Crisis table to find out what dire event happened as
a consequence of the hit, instead of the ship damage.
Some of these Crises are continuing. They will
continue to plague the ship until a PC can solve them
with the Deal With a Crisis general action. Usually this
involves a skill check at difficulty 10, but multiple PCs
can choose to take the Deal With a Crisis action to cooperate in resolving the problem that round.
Some of these Crises are acute. The PCs must resolve them before the end of the ship’s next turn or else
something very bad will happen.
A ship can accept only one Crisis per round, not
including the Into the Fire or Keep it Together captain
actions which may be taken at the captain’s discretion.
Thus, if the ship is hit twice, only one of those hits can
be converted into a Crisis unless the captain uses one
of these actions. A ship accepts a Crisis if any of the
department heads requests it, even if the rest of the
heads don’t want one. Thus, if the ship’s main gun is hit,
the gunnery chief can request a Crisis to prevent the hit
even if the rest of the crew was against it.
To simplify ship combat, NPC ships do not normally accept more than one Crisis per space combat,
at most. They usually just take the damage or negative
effects of hits straight until facing imminent ruin.

Handling Crises

To resolve a Crisis, a PC needs to take the Deal With
a Crisis general action on their department turn. They
must explain what they are doing to solve the problem
to the GM, who will then tell them what combination
of attribute and skill they should roll. The usual difficulty of resolving a crisis is 10, though the GM may
increase or decrease that difficulty by up to 2 points
either way depending on how bad the Crisis is and how
useful the PC’s plan is to resolve it.
If the PC succeeds in the roll, the Crisis is ended.
Continuing Crises no longer apply their penalty to the
ship, and acute Crises are defused before disaster can
strike. If they fail, a continuing Crisis is unchanged and
an acute one is yet unresolved.
More than one PC can try to resolve a Crisis, either
making an independent attempt if they have a relevant
skill, or using their talents to aid the main responder
with the usual rules for aiding another’s skill check.
The Deal With a Crisis general action can also be
used to get a scene’s worth of general activity aboard
the ship. If a xenomorphic monster suddenly breaches
the ship’s hull during a battle with its alien mothership,
two of the PCs might take the Deal With a Crisis action
to spend a scene battling the beast in the guts of the ship
while the rest of the party tries to keep the ship fighting.

Running a Crisis
When a Crisis hits a ship, the GM should describe
it in a concrete way. A Crew Lost crisis, for example,
may be described as “A damage control squad has
been trapped in the engine room and temperatures are rising dangerously high.” A Hull Breach
might be described as “That last hit drove a support column through a capacitor bank; it’s about
to explode.” It should be described as a specific
problem that threatens the ship.
In turn, when a PC chooses to Deal With a
Crisis, they should indicate what it is exactly that
they’re trying to do. A PC with Fix might declare
that they’re trying to pump coolant into the engine room, or a telekinetic PC might try to forcibly
eject the capacitor bank before it can explode.
Don’t worry about being too technically precise with descriptions, or painstakingly deciding
whether the ship has available coolant supplies
or whether the capacitor is one ton or two. Decide whether or not the plan the PC is declaring
is plausible or not in the general sense, and set the
difficulty accordingly.
Extremely good plans or applicable abilities
might make the Crisis resolution check as easy as
difficulty 8, while a very marginal plan that doesn’t
seem likely to help might be difficulty 12. Whatever you do, keep it quick; don’t drag it out in play.

SPACE COMBAT •117

SHIP COMBAT ACTIONS
Every PC can take one or more actions per ship round.
PCs who are department heads can pick actions from
their department. Any PC can pick from the general
actions. Some actions prohibit any other act that round.
Most actions have a cost in Command Points.
Usually, some PCs choose to Do Your Duty or go Above
and Beyond to generate Command Points, while others
then spend them on actions for their department. All
unspent Command Points are lost at the round’s end.
NPC ships usually have a base number of Command Points they can spend each round, and may pick
actions freely to spend them. For simplicity, NPC ships
can’t usually generate more Command Points with
their actions and can’t normally take Captain actions.

Bridge Actions

Escape Combat (4 CP): Roll an opposed Int/Pilot or Dex/
Pilot skill check plus your ship’s Speed against the
fastest opponent’s skill check plus their ship’s
Speed. On a win, all enemy ships gain one point
of Escape. If an enemy ship gets three points, after
three uses of this maneuver, your ship gets away
from that ship and is no longer in combat with it.
Evasive Maneuvers (2 CP): Roll Int or Dex/Pilot against
difficulty 9 to add your Pilot skill to the ship’s AC
until its next turn. Usable once per round at most.
Pursue Target (3 CP): Opposed Int/Pilot or Dex/Pilot
skill check plus Speed against the target ship’s skill
check plus Speed. On a win, you shed one point
of Escape rating the target ship may have on you.

Captain Actions

Into the Fire (0 CP): Accept a Crew Lost Crisis and gain
your Lead skill plus one in Command Points. You
may do this at most once per round.
Keep It Together (0 CP): Nullify a successful enemy hit
and roll a Crisis instead. You can use this action
in Instant response to an enemy hit but you may
only use it once per round.
Support Department (0 CP): Choose a department. One
action that department takes will require 2 fewer
Command Points. You can do this once per round.

Comms Actions

Crash Systems (2 CP): Roll an opposed Int/Program
check against a targeted ship. On a success, it starts
its next turn with a Command Point penalty equal
to your Program skill.
Defeat ECM (2 CP): Roll an opposed Int/Program
against a targeted ship. On a success, any attacks
this round by your ship against the target get a hit
bonus equal to twice your Program skill.
Sensor Ghost (2 CP): Succeed on a difficulty 9 Int/Program check to gain your Program as an AC bonus
until the next turn. Usable once per round at most.

Engineering Actions

Boost Engines (2 CP): Roll Int/Fix versus difficulty 8. On
a success, the ship’s Speed is increased by 2 until
the start of the ship’s next turn.
Damage Control (3 CP): Roll Int/Fix versus difficulty
7. On a success, repair a number of lost hit points
equal to your Fix skill times 2 for fighter hulls, 3
for frigates, 4 for cruisers, and 6 for capital-class
hulls. Each attempt of this action after the first in
a fight increases its difficulty by a cumulative +1.
Emergency Repairs (3 CP): Roll Int/Fix versus difficulty
8. On a success, a disabled system is repaired or
a damage-degraded drive has its rating increased
by 1. Destroyed systems cannot be fixed this way.

Gunnery Actions

Fire All Guns (3 CP): Gunners fire all weapons mounted
on the ship, designating targets as they wish.
Fire One Weapon (2 CP): A gunner fires a single ship’s
weapon of their choice.
Target Systems (1 CP): A Fire One Weapon action you
take this round may target a ship’s weapons, engine, or fittings the GM decides are vulnerable.
Such targeted attacks take -4 to hit. On a hit, do
half damage before applying Armor. If damage
gets through the system is disabled or drive is
degraded by 1 level. Disabled systems hit again
are destroyed. You may take this action more than
once to aim additional shots you may fire.

General Actions

All these general actions are exclusive; if you take one
of these actions you can do nothing else in the round,
either before or after you take the action.
Above and Beyond (0 CP): Push yourself to help the ship
or its crew. Pick an attribute and skill check and
explain how you’re using it to help the ship. If the
GM agrees, roll it against difficulty 9. On a success,
gain your skill level in Command Points plus one.
On a failure, take -1 Command Point.
Deal With a Crisis (0 CP): Explain what you are doing
to solve a Crisis and roll the relevant skill check.
The difficulty is usually 10, plus or minus 2 depending on the situation and the effectiveness of
your action. On a success, the Crisis is resolved.
You may also use this action to aid another PC in
resolving a Crisis, or to take one scene’s worth of
other actions around the ship.
Do Your Duty (0 CP): The ship gains 1 Command Point.
PCs who head more than one department can act
only in one of them; the rest automatically take
this action. If invoked by a PC, they must name
some plausible act the PC is doing to be useful, and
can’t do the same act two rounds in a row.

118• SPACE COMBAT

SHIP CRISES
Once per round, a ship may choose to accept a Crisis
instead of taking an enemy hit. They must choose to
do so immediately after damage is rolled, and only one
player needs to request the Crisis to get it even if the
rest of the party doesn’t want it. Once the Crisis is accepted, the hit is negated and the GM rolls on the table.
The captain may also choose to voluntarily accept
a Crisis through their Keep It Together or Into the Fire
department actions. Use of these actions doesn’t count
against the one-voluntary-Crisis-per-round maximum.
Some Crises are continuing. They will apply a
penalty to the ship that continues until some PC successfully performs a Deal With a Crisis action.
Other Crises are acute. They inflict no immediate
negative consequence, but if the PCs don’t resolve it
by the end of the next combat round, an unpleasant
consequence will ensue. The Crisis is then removed.
The same Crisis rolled more than once will stack
on the ship, though hits to empty cargo holds or dry
fuel tanks may not be much of a problem to the ship.

Dealing With a Crisis

Any PC can Deal With a Crisis by taking that general action and describing what they’re doing to solve
the problem. They then roll an applicable skill check
against difficulty 10, possibly modified by up to plus or
minus two depending on the GM’s judgment of their
general plan and its likelihood of being helpful. On a
success, the Crisis is resolved. All Crises are considered
resolved at the end of an engagement.

Crises

Armor Loss: The hit melted an important patch of ship
armor, cracked an internal support, or exposed a
sensitive system. Until resolved, the ship’s Armor
rating is halved, rounded down.
Cargo Loss: The hit has gored open a cargo bay, threatening to dump the hold or expose delicate contents to ruinous damage. If not resolved by the end
of the next round, lose d10*10% of the ship’s cargo.
Crew Lost: Brave crew risk their lives to keep damaged
systems operating. Describe the danger they face.
If the Crisis is not resolved by the end of the next
round, 10% of the ship’s maximum crew are incapacitated, not counting any Extended Life Support
fittings. Half these crewmen are dead or permanently disabled, and the other half return to duty
in a week. Extended Medbay fittings halve the number of dead and crippled. If the ship has run out
of NPC crew when it takes this Crisis, a random
PC must roll a Physical save; on a success, they
lose half their hit points, while on a failure, they
are mortally wounded. If not stabilized by the end
of the ship’s turn through some PC taking a Deal
With A Crisis action to heal them, they will die.

Engine Lock: The ship’s engine has been jammed or
control circuits have gone non-responsive. Until
resolved, no bridge actions can be taken, though
the pilot can still perform general actions.
Fuel Bleed: The ship’s fuel tanks have been holed or
emergency vents have been force-triggered by
battle damage. If not resolved by the end of the
next round, the ship will jettison all fuel except the
minimal amount needed for in-system operation.
Haywire Systems: Critical command links have been
damaged or disordered by the hit. Until resolved,
the ship starts each round at -2 Command Points.
Multiple such Crises can stack this penalty, crippling a ship until the Crises are resolved.
Hull Breach: The hull has been damaged in a way that is
currently non-critical but is about to tear open an
important compartment or crumple on vital systems. If not resolved by the end of the next round,
the ship will take damage: 1d10 for fighter-class
hulls, 2d10 for frigates, 3d10 for cruisers, and 4d10
for capital hulls, all ignoring Armor.
System Damage: One of the ship’s systems has been
cooked by the hit. The GM randomly picks a
weapon, fitting, or engine; that system is disabled
as if hit with a targeted shot, with drives suffering
a 1 point drive level decrease. Disabled systems hit
by this Crisis or drives reduced below drive-0 are
destroyed and cannot be repaired during combat.
Target Decalibration: The gunnery computers are
hopelessly confused and cannot lock the ship’s
weaponry on a target until this Crisis is resolved.
VIP Imperiled: Shipboard damage threatens a random
PC or important NPC. That victim must immediately roll a Physical saving throw; on a success,
they lose half their hit points, and on a failure they
are mortally wounded. NPC crew can make a free
attempt to stabilize the downed VIP using their
usual NPC skill bonus. If the NPC fails, and no PC
takes a Deal With a Crisis action to successfully stabilize them by the end of the ship’s turn, they die.

SPACE COMBAT •119

The Thunder of the Guns
The free merchant Grendel finds herself engaging the
Sacred Wrath, a patrol boat of the Luminous Hegemony determined to stop the Grendel before it can
deliver its cargo of military supplies to the rebel outpost that contracted the ship. Captain Wilhelmina
Stokes knows she’s substantially outclassed by the
patrol boat, but she trusts her comrades and is determined to blast her way through.
The combat begins with an initiative roll. The
Grendel’s pilot rolls 1d8 plus the best of his Intelligence or Dexterity modifiers, getting a 6. The
Wrath’s pilot rolls a 4, so Grendel goes first.
Grendel starts her turn with 0 Command Points.
Captain Stokes decides that she’ll act first among the
crew, and uses the Support Department action to aid
the gunnery department; one action the gunner
takes will be 2 Command Points cheaper than usual.
The ship still has no Command Points, however, so Captain Stokes tells the comms chief to go
next. Feeling daring, the comms chief decides to go
Above and Beyond to help the ship, overclocking the
ship’s computing core. The GM decides this is an
Int/Program skill check, so the comms chief rolls it
against difficulty 9. He fails his first roll, but uses his
Expert class reroll benefit to try again, and gets it the
second time. The ship gains 3 Command Points for
the comms chief’s Program-2 skill.
Stokes considers letting the gunner blaze away
now, but she wants to go for a real torrent of fire to
open the fight, so she asks the bridge pilot to act next
to build more Command Points. He chooses to Do
Your Duty, adding 1 CP and declaring that he’s lining
the ship up for the shot.
Three Command Points aren’t enough for the
captain, so despite the gunner’s entreaties, she chooses for the engineer to go next. She also plays it safe,
deciding to Do Your Duty and feed power to the guns.
Lastly, there’s a sixth PC in the crew, a storyteller with absolutely no applicable space-faring skills.
Even though he is no department head, the captain
nominates him to act next, since every PC gets to act
each round. Able to take only general actions, the
storyteller chants a mighty lay of battle to encourage
his comrades on to glory. The GM lets him roll a
Cha/Perform skill check to go Above and Beyond, and
he succeeds, adding 3 more Command Points from
his Perform-2 skill.
Now, at last, with 8 Command Points, the captain gives the gunner her signal. The gunner decides
that it’s absolutely critical to defang the patrol boat
before it can open up with its plasma beam. He
chooses to Target Systems with his attack, spending
1 CP. He knows the free merchant’s sandcaster has
no chance of piercing the patrol boat’s armor, but
his multifocal laser can cut through the ship’s plat-

ing. Thus, instead of trying to fire the sandcaster this
round, he decides to blaze away exclusively with the
laser, using the Fire One Weapon action. Firing one
weapon costs 2 Command Points and he has 5 left,
plus the captain’s Support Department action to give
him a zero-cost shot.
The gunner is a grizzled Warrior and uses his
class ability to make the first shot an automatic hit.
He rolls 1d4 for damage, +1 for his Dexterity modifier, and gets a 3. The multifocal laser’s armor-piercing
quality of 20 overwhelms the patrol boat’s Armor
of 5, but since he’s Targeting Systems, his damage
is halved, rounded up. The patrol boat takes 2 hit
points of damage… but its plasma beam is now disabled until the boat’s crew can perform repairs.
The gunner’s not satisfied; he wants that gun
wrecked. He Fires One Weapon again for 2 CP, Targeting Systems once more for 1 CP, rolling a hit roll at
-4 and using his Shoot skill and Dexterity attribute to
modify his attack bonus. He hits with a 15 and does
another 2 damage, destroying the gun.
The GM decides that the patrol boat’s captain
is willing to go to extremes to prevent this, and lets
him accept a Crisis instead. The GM rolls 1d10 and
gets the Hull Breach crisis; if the boat can’t resolve
it by the end of the next round, it’ll take 2d10 hit
points of damage that ignores Armor, but for now
the gunner’s second hit is negated. The gunner has
2 CP left, so he burns those and his captain-supplied
free shot on two more attacks, both of which miss.
The round ends, and if the Grendel had any CP left it
would lose them now.
Being a properly-trained military crew, the
Sacred Wrath has 5 Command Points. Her captain
knows that her absolute priority is getting her gun
back online, so he spends 3 points to do Emergency
Repairs from the engineer actions. The GM rolls her
crew’s default +2 skill bonus and gets a 9, enough to
fix the plasma beam and remove its disabled status.
That leaves the NPC ship with 2 Command
Points left, which is just enough to open fire. The
gunner blasts away with the plasma beam, using his
hit bonus of +4 to get a 17, enough to hit the Grendel.
The plasma beam does 12 points of damage to the
free merchant, its AP 10 defeating the target’s Armor.
Captain Stokes can’t handle a hit like this and
immediately accepts a Crisis. The GM rolls an Armor
Loss result, halving the Grendel’s already-sad Armor.
The next round then begins. The PCs have the
edge, as the Wrath is going to need to Deal With a Crisis or take a heavy hit at round’s end. If the Grendel’s
gunner can’t shut down that plasma beam, however,
the free merchant runs the risk of eating more hits
than it can survive… or trying to evade those hits and
rolling a Crisis her crew can’t handle.
