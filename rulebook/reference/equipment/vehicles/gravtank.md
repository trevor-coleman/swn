# Gravtank

## Overview
Make up the bulk of prosperous TL4 worlds' armored forces. Private ownership strictly forbidden on most worlds, but "export models" often available for transport offworld.

## Statistics
- **Cost**: 200,000 credits
- **Speed**: 2
- **Armor**: Special (Immune to non-Heavy weapons)
- **Hit Points**: 50
- **Crew**: 3
- **Tonnage**: 50
- **Tech Level**: 5

## Description
Gravtanks are specialized weapons platforms with armor heavy enough to ignore all damage from conventional small arms. They can only be harmed by Heavy weapons or properly-placed demolition charges.

## Special Armor
- **Immunity**: All non-Heavy weapons
- **TL4 Heavy**: Required to damage
- **TL3 Heavy**: Can damage
- **Small Arms**: No effect
- **Demolitions**: Specially placed only

## Capabilities
- Can mount 6 weapons
- Advanced targeting systems
- All weapons fired by one gunner
- Gravitic propulsion
- All-terrain operation

## Combat Systems
- **Weapon Mounts**: 6 hardpoints
- **Targeting**: Advanced fire control
- **Integration**: Single gunner operation
- **Coverage**: 360Â° traverse
- **Automation**: Target prioritization

## Crew Positions
- 1 Commander/Gunner
- 1 Driver
- 1 Systems Operator
- Highly trained crew required
- Neural link compatibility (some models)

## Weapon Configurations
Common loadouts:
- Main gun + 5 support weapons
- 6 heavy weapons array
- Mixed anti-infantry/anti-armor
- Point defense systems
- Electronic warfare suite

## Gravitic Advantages
- Ignore terrain obstacles
- Cross water barriers
- Stable firing platform
- No ground pressure
- Silent movement

## Tactical Role
- Spearhead assaults
- Area denial
- Fire support
- Breakthrough operations
- Urban pacification

## Legal Status
- Military only (most worlds)
- Export models available
- Strict registration required
- Offworld transport only
- Black market exists

## Export Model Differences
- Reduced armor possible
- Weapon limitations
- No military encryption
- Tracking devices
- Remote shutdowns

## Comparison to Ground Tanks
| Feature | Gravtank | Traditional Tank |
|---------|----------|------------------|
| Mobility | Superior | Limited |
| Armor | Special | Heavy |
| Weapons | 6 | 1-3 |
| Crew | 3 | 4-5 |
| Cost | 200k | 50-100k |

## Power Requirements
- Multiple power cells
- High drain systems
- 6-hour combat operation
- Extended cruise mode
- Emergency batteries

## Maintenance
- TL5 systems optimal
- TL4 can service
- Complex gravitics
- Weapon calibration
- Armor inspection

## Electronic Warfare
- ECM suite standard
- Target designation
- Communication jamming
- Sensor spoofing
- Drone control

## Defensive Systems
- Point defense weapons
- Smoke generators
- Chaff/flare dispensers
- Reactive armor (optional)
- Shield generators (rare)

## Operating Doctrine
- Combined arms support
- Infantry cooperation
- Air cover preferred
- Supply line dependent
- Maintenance intensive

## Vulnerabilities
- Heavy weapons
- Demolition charges
- EMP attacks (limited)
- Gravitic interference
- Sustained bombardment

## Cost Breakdown
- Base vehicle: 200,000
- Weapons: Additional
- Ammunition: Varies
- Maintenance: High
- Crew training: Extensive

## Historical Note
Gravtank technology represents the pinnacle of TL4 ground combat systems, though the TL5 designation indicates incorporation of limited pretech systems in manufacturing.

## Variants
- **Assault**: Maximum weapons
- **Command**: Enhanced comms
- **Support**: Repair/supply
- **Urban**: Anti-infantry focus
- **Siege**: Heavy bombardment
