# Vehicles

Most modern TL4 worlds rely on electrically-powered gravitic vehicles. Whether in the ubiquitous gravcar, hovercycle, or high-altitude gravflyer, cleared roadways carry the traffic of countless worlds. On rougher worlds, the roads may not even be paved, instead relying on a gravitic vehicle's high clearance to avoid holes and rough debris.

Less sophisticated worlds are still reliant on internal-combustion engines. Many worlds have sufficient local resources to fabricate some kind of combustible fuel, but a few are so impoverished that they lack even this minimal resource. Such worlds must rely on muscle power for transport, either that of alien beasts or humble human porters.

## Vehicle Statistics

### Power Requirements
- TL4 vehicles: Type B power cells
- TL3 and below: Biofuel or fossil fuels
- One cell/refueling per 6 hours of operation

### Terrain Capabilities
- **Standard vehicles**: Limited to reasonably flat, dry terrain
- **Grav vehicles**: Can ignore rough terrain and calm water
- **ATVs**: Can handle rough terrain
- **Gravflyers**: Purpose-designed aircraft with hover/VTOL capability

### Combat Statistics
- **Speed**: Abstract measure of speed and agility (penalty to opposing Pilot checks)
- **Armor**: Reduces damage except from Heavy weapons
- **Hit Points**: Damage capacity (half speed at 50% HP)
- **Crew**: Maximum occupants (only one needed to drive)

## Vehicle Combat Rules

### Hitting Vehicles
- **Stationary within 30 feet**: Automatic hit
- **Beyond 30 feet or moving**: Attack vs AC 10
- **Target moving**: Subtract target's Speed from hit roll
- **Attacker also moving**: Also subtract attacker's Speed

### Damage and Destruction
- **Half HP**: Speed reduced by half; flying vehicles must land
- **Zero HP**: All occupants make Physical saves
  - **Failure**: Take vehicle's max HP in damage
  - **Success**: Take half damage

### Heavy Weapons vs Vehicles
- Normal weapons have damage reduced by vehicle Armor
- Heavy weapons ignore vehicle Armor
- Gravtanks immune to all but TL4 Heavy weapons
- Standard tanks immune to below TL3 Heavy weapons

## Vehicle Weaponry

### Mounting Capacity
- **Motorcycle/Hovercycle**: No integral weapons
- **Groundcar/Gravcar**: 1 weapon
- **ATV/Helicopter/Atmoflyer/Gravflyer**: 2 weapons
- **Gravtank**: 6 weapons (advanced targeting)

### Weapon Requirements
- Heavy weapons take space of 2 normal weapons
- Each weapon needs its own gunner
- All use Shoot skill (or Pilot for nose-mounted)
- Gravtanks can have all weapons fired by one gunner

## Purchase Notes

Prices reflect mid-range new vehicles sold to PCs with few local contacts. Natives who know the right people or are willing to buy used or "quirky" vehicles might get one at half price.

## Special Vehicle Properties

### Gravitic Vehicles
- Can boost 10+ meters above ground
- Ignore difficult terrain
- Hover capability
- Higher tech requirements

### Military Restrictions
- Gravtanks strictly forbidden for civilians on most worlds
- "Export models" may be available for offworld transport
- Heavy weapon mounts often require permits
