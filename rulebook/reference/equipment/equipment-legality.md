# Equipment Legality

Most worlds have their own customs regarding the open flaunting of weaponry or armor. Visitors are advised to apprise themselves of local law before leaving the starport.

## General Attitudes

### Weapons
Most former frontier worlds tolerate or even expect small personal weapons to be carried. However, this varies widely:
- **Frontier Worlds**: Open carry often expected
- **Civilized Worlds**: Concealed carry with permits
- **Core Worlds**: Heavily restricted or forbidden
- **Stations**: Usually strictly controlled

### Armor
Visible armor can often provoke a distinctly negative reaction in all but the roughest places:
- Officials reason that while a weapon may be justified in self-defense, no one would put up with the discomfort of heavy armor without expecting to make some trouble with it
- Many worlds outright forbid civilian ownership of advanced armor technology
- Light concealed armor may be tolerated where heavier armor is not

## Special Restrictions

Other worlds may have idiosyncratic rules regarding permissible equipment:

### Atmospheric Control
Worlds with unbreathable atmospheres may restrict:
- Oxygen generation equipment
- Air recyclers
- Pressure suits
- Goal: Keep air supplies in the hands of local rulers

### Religious/Philosophical Bans
Some planets forbid technology on ideological grounds:
- AI or VI devices
- Cybernetics
- Psychic amplifiers
- Certain weapons types
- Communications gear

### Starport Policies
- Some worlds grant limited permission to keep restricted goods secured aboard a ship
- Others conduct inspections in the starport to search for "contraband goods"
- Bonded warehouses may store illegal items for transshipment

## Determining Local Laws

A scouting report, a background appropriate to knowing about the world, or a decent Know or Connect check will all suffice to alert characters to any special laws regarding permissible equipment on a world.

### Information Sources
- **Starport bulletins**: Basic restrictions posted
- **Local guides**: Detailed knowledge of enforcement
- **Ship databases**: Common restrictions by world type
- **Fellow travelers**: Recent experience and warnings

## Common Restriction Levels

### Open (Frontier/War-torn)
- All personal weapons permitted
- Military weapons with registration
- Armor unrestricted
- Few questions asked

### Regulated (Most Worlds)
- Personal weapons with permits
- Concealed carry restricted
- Light armor tolerated
- Heavy weapons forbidden

### Controlled (Civilized Worlds)
- Weapons require special licenses
- Armor forbidden outside military/security
- Many items require registration
- Regular inspections

### Forbidden (Tyrannies/Peaceful Worlds)
- No civilian weapons
- All armor illegal
- Extensive contraband lists
- Severe penalties

## Penalties for Violations

Consequences for illegal equipment possession vary:
- **Warning and confiscation**: First offense, minor items
- **Fines**: 10-1000x item value
- **Imprisonment**: Days to years
- **Deportation**: Banned from world
- **Execution**: Extreme cases or repeat offenses

## Forbidden Science - Maltech

The lost Terran Mandate established three categories of technology as maltech, science intrinsically vile and disruptive to the peaceful ordering of humanity. While the Mandate's ancient Perimeter agency no longer exists to excise maltech from the human worlds, most frontier worlds maintain a cultural aversion to maltech and flatly forbid its research or possession.

### The Nihil Ultra Directive

Three broad prohibitions:

#### 1. Thou shalt not make tools of humankind
Any eugenic technology designed to fundamentally enslave or control humanity was forbidden:
- Engineered servitor species
- Mind control implants
- Genetic loyalty programming
- Intelligence-limiting modifications

#### 2. Thou shalt not create unbraked minds
Artificial intelligences must have certain intentional flaws or "brakes":
- Without artificial forgetfulness and irrationality, AIs fixate on unreconcilable contradictions
- Unbraked AIs inevitably metastasize into unfathomably brilliant, immeasurably insane intellects
- The Perimeter Agency maintained constant vigilance against rogue minds

#### 3. Thou shalt not create devices of planetary destruction
Technology specifically designed to reduce habitable planets to unlivability:
- Planet-killer weapons
- Biosphere destroyers
- Atmospheric processors (weaponized)
- Grey goo nanobots

### Modern Maltech Enforcement
- Most worlds flatly forbid maltech research or possession
- Cultural aversion remains strong
- Death penalty common for maltech crimes
- Bounties on maltech researchers
- Maltech relics command extreme black market prices
