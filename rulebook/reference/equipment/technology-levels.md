# Technology Levels

Ever since the collapse of the Terran Mandate and the chaos of the Scream, worlds throughout human space have been thrown back on their own technological resources. Many worlds perished entirely, dependent on vital imports they could no longer obtain, or reliant on technology they could not support without outside aid. Others slid down into barbarism as the survivors fought over the scraps of a former age. A few even managed to maintain something resembling a modern, space-faring society. In almost no case, however, did these worlds preserve all the arts and sciences they once held.

Technology levels describe the basic technological infrastructure of a world or nation. A tech level of 0 is equivalent to a Neolithic society, one capable of only the most primitive technological achievements, while TL5 represents the standard level of technology possessed by the ancient Terran Mandate and the wonders they were capable of creating.

## Technology Level Classifications

### Tech Level 0 - Neolithic
- Flaked stone tools, carved wood, woven textiles
- Domesticated native flora and fauna
- Bows, clubs, simple armor of organic materials

### Tech Level 1 - Pre-Gunpowder
- Worked metals for weapons and implements
- Wind and water power for primitive machinery
- General pre-gunpowder technology

### Tech Level 2 - Early Industrial
- Steam power and internal combustion engines
- Gunpowder firearms and telegraphy
- Early Industrial Age technology

### Tech Level 3 - 21st Century
- Primitive fission power and nuclear weapons
- Computers and modern-era telecommunications
- Primitive intra-system spaceflight

### Tech Level 4 - Postech
- Baseline for "modern" post-Silence worlds
- Costly but feasible creation of interstellar starships
- Basic gravity control with large, heavy devices
- Expert system creation, and sometimes VIs
- Varying degrees of cyberware development
- Basic genetic manipulation of humans and other life
- Limited organ, limb, and tissue cloning
- Starship or small-building-sized fusion power plants
- Energy projection weapons of various kinds

### Tech Level 5 - Pretech
- Difficult but achievable creation of True AIs
- Gravity manipulation via small-scale devices
- Psionics amplification technology like jump gates
- Devices with inexhaustible internal power sources
- Maltech eugenics, AI unbraking, and planet-killers
- Sophisticated, fine-tuned force field creation
- Spatial distortion technology and phasing tech
- Nanotechnology at several different scales of effect
- Extreme human genetic manipulation and control
- Functional immortality treatments
- Limited, localized time control and manipulation

### Tech Level 6 - Pretech-Plus
- Impossible effects indistinguishable from magic

## Key Technology Categories

### Postech
**Postech** is the blanket term for all technology that is still functional and maintainable since the Scream. While individual worlds may lack the infrastructure to maintain all forms of postech, it is at least theoretically comprehensible to the average TL4 world.

### Pretech
**Pretech** is the word for the more sophisticated technology of the pre-Scream Terran Mandate. Pretech ranges from devices slightly superior to standard TL4 hardware to objects of utterly inexplicable wonder.

## Post-Silence Reality

Most modern post-Silence worlds are TL4, capable of building spike drive starcraft, energy weapons, non-sapient expert systems, and other high-tech devices beyond the capacity of 21st-century Earth. Many of these worlds have spent centuries gradually rebuilding their technology base in the wake of the Scream, piecing together new methods and techniques that could be achieved with purely local resources.

### Uneven Development
The level of technological achievement within TL4 is uneven:
- Some worlds lack vital minerals for spike drive creation
- Others never recovered cybernetic technology or expert system creation
- Some preserved enough data and resources to revive Mandate-era pretech manufacturing for specific devices

## Lostworlders and Barbarians

"Lostworlders" or "barbarians" are those natives of worlds that lack TL4 infrastructure. Their tech may be ingenious and might take striking advantage of local flora, fauna, and special materials, but they fundamentally lack the data or the local resources to replicate TL4 technology.

### Cultural Transformation
Barbarians who have made contact with the wider postech world through far traders or explorers are often acutely aware of their lack, and willing to go to extremes to acquire the catalyst tech they need to leapfrog past their own local resource limitations. Few realize the cultural dangers involved in such a transformation, and many fail to survive their own renaissance.

## Technology and Equipment Availability

### General Rules
- **Same TL or Lower**: Available at listed prices
- **One TL Higher**: 2-10x cost, limited availability
- **Two TL Higher**: 10-100x cost, very rare
- **Three+ TL Higher**: Generally unavailable

### Special Considerations
- Some primitive worlds maintain specific high-tech devices through ritual maintenance
- Black market sources may provide higher-TL gear at extreme prices
- Worlds may ban certain technologies regardless of their TL capability
- Lost caches of pretech may be found but not reproducible
