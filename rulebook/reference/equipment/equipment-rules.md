# Equipment Rules

Core rules for equipment, encumbrance, money, and technology in Stars Without Number.

## Encumbrance

Characters can only carry limited gear. The encumbrance system tracks this without complex weight calculations.

### Carrying Capacity

#### Readied Items
- **Limit**: Half Strength score (rounded down)
- **Access**: Can draw/use as part of any action
- **Includes**: Worn armor, holstered weapons, belt items
- **Excludes**: Normal clothing and jewelry

#### Stowed Items  
- **Limit**: Full Strength score
- **Access**: Takes Main Action to retrieve
- **Includes**: Backpack contents, spare gear
- **Location**: Packs, pockets, balanced carrying

### Encumbrance Levels

#### Unencumbered
- Normal capacity only
- Movement: 10 meters/round

#### Lightly Encumbered
- +2 Readied OR +4 Stowed items
- Movement: 7 meters/round
- No other penalties

#### Heavily Encumbered
- +4 Readied OR +8 Stowed items total
- Movement: 5 meters/round
- GM may impose skill penalties

### Special Cases

#### Small Items
- Very small items in small numbers: No encumbrance
- Can bundle small items together
- Bundle counts as 1 item
- Takes extra round to unpack bundles

#### Bundle Examples
- 6 Type A power cells = 1 item
