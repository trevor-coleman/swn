# Full Plate

## Stats
- **Armor Class**: 17
- **Cost**: 100 credits
- **Encumbrance**: 2
- **Tech Level**: 1
- **Category**: Primitive Armor

## Description
Full plate armor represents the pinnacle of pre-spacefaring protective technology. This complete suit of articulated metal plates covers the wearer from head to toe, with carefully designed joints that allow for surprising mobility despite the armor's weight. Layered mail protects the few gaps necessary for movement.

## Properties
- **Primitive Limitation**: This armor is useless against advanced TL4 melee weapons and firearms of all kinds. Against these weapons, it is treated as AC 10.
- **Heavy**: Counts as 2 items for encumbrance
- **Complete Protection**: Covers entire body with overlapping plates
- **Maintenance Required**: Needs regular care to prevent rust and joint seizure

## Usage Notes
- Requires assistance to don properly (10-15 minutes)
- Significantly impairs swimming and climbing
- Symbol of wealth and status on primitive worlds
- Often custom-fitted to the wearer
- May include decorative elements without compromising protection

## Combat Considerations
- Excellent against primitive weapons
- Weight distributed across body when properly fitted
- Vision and hearing somewhat restricted by helmet
- Heat buildup can be problematic in warm climates

## Variants
- **Gothic Plate**: Fluted design for increased strength
- **Maximilian Armor**: Distinctive ridged appearance
- **Tournament Armor**: Extra-heavy version for jousting
- **Parade Armor**: Elaborately decorated ceremonial version
