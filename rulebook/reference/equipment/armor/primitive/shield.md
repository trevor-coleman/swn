## Description
Shields are an ancient yet extremely useful adjunct to body armor. Primitive shields are usually constructed from wood or stretched hide, designed to deflect blows and projectiles. Despite their simplicity, shields remain effective even in modern combat for those skilled in their use.

## Special Properties
- **Requires Free Hand**: Must have one hand free to use effectively
- **Stacking Bonus**: The +1 AC bonus stacks with any worn armor
- **Universal Design**: Can be manufactured by any TL0+ society

## Variants
- **Primitive Shield**: Wood and hide construction (standard stats)
- **Riot Shield**: Modern materials, same stats but TL3
- **Force Pavis**: Advanced TL5 energy shield (see separate entry)

## Tactical Notes
Shields are particularly useful for:
- Melee combatants who want extra protection
- Characters who can't afford better armor
- Situations where armor is socially unacceptable
- Defensive fighting styles

## Availability
Found on virtually every world, though materials and construction vary. Primitive worlds favor wood and hide, while advanced worlds might use transparent polymers or light alloys.
