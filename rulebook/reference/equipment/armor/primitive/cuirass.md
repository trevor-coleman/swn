## Stats

- **Cost**: 50 credits
- **Encumbrance**: 1
- **Tech Level**: 1
- **Category**: Primitive Armor

## Description
The cuirass represents a significant advancement in primitive armor technology, combining a solid breastplate with additional protective elements. Common varieties include brigandine (metal plates riveted inside a cloth covering), the Greek linothorax (layers of linen glued together), and traditional half-plate configurations.

## Properties
- **Primitive Limitation**: This armor is useless against advanced TL4 melee weapons and firearms of all kinds. Against these weapons, it is treated as AC 10.
- **Partial Coverage**: Protects vital organs while maintaining mobility
- **Craftsmanship**: Requires skilled metalworking or specialized techniques

## Usage Notes
- Standard equipment for professional soldiers on TL1 worlds
- Offers good protection without the full encumbrance of plate armor
- Often combined with helmets and additional limb protection
- Can be worn by mounted warriors without significant impediment

## Variants
- **Brigandine**: Small metal plates sewn between layers of fabric
- **Linothorax**: Laminated linen armor, surprisingly effective
- **Scale Mail**: Overlapping metal scales on a backing
- **Lamellar**: Small rectangular plates laced together

## Historical Note
These armor types represent the peak of pre-gunpowder military technology, offering excellent protection against the weapons of their era while remaining practical for extended campaigns.
