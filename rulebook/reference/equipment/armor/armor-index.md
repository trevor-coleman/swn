# Armor Index

Armor is a popular acquisition for adventurers as their lifestyle often puts them in harm's way. Completely unarmored human combatants rarely last very long in a fight, and have a base Armor Class of 10. Armored or not, characters add their Dexterity modifiers to their Armor Class. The higher a person's AC, the harder it is to take them out of a fight.

Heavy suits of armor can count as more than one item for encumbrance purposes. Very light suits may not encumber at all.

## Armor Categories

### Primitive Armor
A catch-all covering all armor technology that lacks access to advanced materials and processes. While such armor can be very effective in protecting against primitive weaponry, it is **useless against advanced TL4 melee weapons and firearms of all kinds**. Against these weapons, it is treated as AC 10.

Note that some planets have native flora or fauna capable of naturally producing extremely effective armor materials, ones not susceptible to this limitation.

### Street Armor
The sort of TL4 gear one can wear in public without social repercussions. Such armor is disguised as ordinary street clothing or is so light as to be wearable under an ordinary outfit. PCs can wear street armor on most worlds without incurring any trouble from authorities.

### Combat Armor
Obviously armor and cannot be effectively disguised. Most worlds reserve combat armor to law enforcement officials, military personnel, and the bodyguards of important or wealthy citizens. Most law enforcers consider anybody wearing combat armor to be a person clearly expecting military-grade problems in their immediate future.

### Powered Armor
The heaviest personal protection gear available short of an actual mech. Most powered armor requires at least a month of training before it can be used effectively by any PC who hasn't got a background involving such experience. Someone wearing armor of this class is **immune to primitive melee weapons, unarmed attacks, and any firearm or grenade-scale explosive of TL3 or less**.

## Shield Rules

Shields grant a base AC to their user; 13 for primitive and riot shields, and 15 for a force pavis. If the bearer's AC is already equal or better, the shield simply grants a +1 AC bonus. Primitive and riot shields are ignored by all weapons that ignore primitive armor.

Aside from their AC benefit, a shield also renders the bearer **immune to the first instance of melee Shock damage** they take each round, assuming the shield is effective against the weapon being used.

All shields require one free hand to use effectively.

## Legality
- **Street Armor**: Generally legal on most worlds
- **Combat Armor**: Requires permits on civilized worlds
- **Powered Armor**: Usually restricted to military/government use
