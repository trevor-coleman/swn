# Encumbrance

Characters might want to carry an armory on their backs and the contents of a general store in their pockets, but this is rarely a practical ambition. Characters can only carry so many things, and carrying a great deal can slow them down substantially.

## Readied Items

A character can have **Readied** a number of items equal to **half their Strength score, rounded down**.

Ready items include those that the character is using or wearing at all times, or that they have conveniently to hand in sheaths, holsters, or belt pouches. Suits of armor count as Readied items, but the normal clothing and jewelry that a character might wear does not. A character can draw or produce a Readied item as part of any action they may take during a turn.

## Stowed Items

A character may have a number of **Stowed** items equal to their **full Strength score**.

Stowed items are carried in backpacks, in carefully-balanced leg or arm pockets, or otherwise packed away where they will least encumber the character. If a character needs to get out a Stowed item in a hurry, they must use their Main Action to dig it out of their pack or pockets.

## Small Items and Bundles

Very small items carried in small numbers do not count against encumbrance limits. Other small items can be packed together into bundles to simplify their carriage, though getting at them then takes an additional round of fumbling with the packaging.

### Bundle Guidelines
- **6 Type A energy cells** = 1 item bundle
- **3 magazines of bullets** = 1 item bundle
- Exact bundling limits are at GM discretion
- Extremely bulky or unwieldy objects might count as multiple items

## Encumbrance Levels

Characters can burden themselves with more gear if they're willing to sacrifice some fleetness of foot.

### Lightly Encumbered
- **Additional Capacity**: +2 Readied items OR +4 Stowed items
- **Movement**: Reduced from 10 meters/round to **7 meters/round**

### Heavily Encumbered
- **Additional Capacity**: +4 Readied items OR +8 Stowed items (total)
- **Movement**: Reduced from 10 meters/round to **5 meters/round**

## Special Encumbrance Values

On the equipment lists, some items are given an encumbrance value higher than 1. These items count as multiple objects for encumbrance purposes, being heavy, clumsy, or unwieldy to carry.
