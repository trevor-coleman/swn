# Drones

In the far future, it's often more convenient to send an expendable grav-flying probe into danger before venturing less repairable assets. Well-prepared adventuring groups often have reason to pack along a drone or two for exploring and aerial recon.

Military use of drones is limited by the ubiquitous use of quantum ECM. The easy confusion of electronic navigation makes it impossible to control an unwired drone remotely on a modern battlefield or in proximity to important civil structures, but in the alien wilds or away from urban centers, drones remain a feasible tool for explorers and conquerors of primitive militaries.

## Piloting a Drone

### Control Methods
- **Cybernetic drone control link**: Can pilot up to 1 + Program skill drones simultaneously
- **Handheld control unit**: Comes with drone, can only pilot one drone

### Operating Requirements
- **Power**: One Type A cell per hour of operation
- **Actions**: Pilot must spend Main Action each round to command move OR shoot
- **Uncontrolled drones**:
  - Control link: Remain stationary
  - Handheld unit: 2-in-6 chance of crashing if not controlled

### Movement
- **Combat**: 30 meters per round on pilot's turn
- **Non-combat**: Up to 100 km/hour

### Detection
- **Observation range**: Wis/Notice DC 10
- **Engagement range**: Wis/Notice DC 8
- **Secure facilities**: Automatic detection

## Drone Weapon Rules

### Mounting Weapons
- Small ranged weapons only (pistol-sized)
- Requires Weapon Mount fitting (2 slots)
- Uses drone's power for energy weapons
- Projectile weapons need ammo supply

### Combat Operations
- Pilot uses Main Action to command shoot
- Uses pilot's Shoot skill
- Range penalties apply normally
- Cannot burst fire

## Special Drone Types

### Void Hawks
- Designed for space operations
- Cannot function in atmosphere
- Perfect for ship-to-ship recon
- Silent running capability

### Cuttlefish
- Aquatic operations only
- Sonar navigation system
- Double fitting capacity
- Limited range due to sonar

### Ghostwalker
- Radar-transparent materials
- Integral Sensor Transparency
- Detection DC 11 (vs 9 normal)
- Preferred for infiltration

### Sleeper
- Integral Stationkeeping
- 1 day hover = 5 minutes power
- Ideal for long surveillance
- Can remain on station for weeks

## Limitations

### Quantum ECM
- Military zones have drone jamming
- Important civil structures protected
- Urban centers often restricted
- Wilderness operations unaffected

### Detection
- All secure facilities detect civilian drones
- Military drones may have countermeasures
- Primitive worlds lack detection capability
