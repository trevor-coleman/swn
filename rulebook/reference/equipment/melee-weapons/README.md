## Shock Damage

### How It Works
- Applied on **missed** attacks only
- Only if target's AC â‰¤ Shock threshold
- Always includes attribute modifier
- Always includes other damage bonuses

### Example
Warrior with Str 14 (+1) using Medium Primitive (2/AC 13):
- vs AC 13 or less: 3 Shock damage on miss (2 + 1)
- vs AC 14+: No Shock damage
- On hit: At least 3 damage (never less than Shock)
