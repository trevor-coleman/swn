# Power Cell, Type A

## Quick Stats
- **Cost**: 10 credits
- **Encumbrance**: 1#
- **Tech Level**: 4

## Description
One of the few standardized artifacts inherited from before the Silence, type A power cells are small cylindrical objects designed to take and hold electrical charges. They are primarily used for personal equipment and represent one of the most successful examples of pre-Scream technological standardization.

## Physical Characteristics
- Small cylindrical shape
- Standardized connectors for universal compatibility
- Durable casing resistant to environmental damage
- Visual charge indicator on most models

## Technical Details
- Designed for personal-scale equipment
- Cannot be exchanged with Type B cells without modification
- Engineering substantially different from Type B cells
- Requires converter unit for cross-compatibility

## Recharging
- Can be recharged from ship's power plant or any standard grid
- Full recharge time: 30 minutes
- Compatible with solar rechargers (1 cell per day)
- Can be charged via telekinetic generator (15 minutes with Telekinesis-1)

## Common Applications
- Personal weapons (laser pistols, rifles)
- Communication devices
- Low-light goggles
- Survival equipment
- Medical devices
- Most handheld tools

## Encumbrance Note
The hashmark (#) indicates this item can be packed together. Three type A cells count as 1 encumbrance item.

## Historical Note
The universal adoption of standardized power cells was one of the Mandate's greatest logistical achievements. Even after the Scream and centuries of isolation, virtually every human world maintains compatibility with these standard cells.
