## Quick Stats
- **Cost**: 10 credits
- **Encumbrance**: 1#
- **Tech Level**: 2

## Description
A few worlds are too primitive or too resource-poor to manufacture ammunition, but the vast majority of worlds provide cartridges in almost every conceivable caliber and make. Most local gunsmiths can load ammunition to any specification required by a buyer.

## Details
- Standard pack contains 20 rounds
- Can be used interchangeably with any projectile weapon
- Available in virtually all calibers on most worlds
- Local gunsmiths can customize loads to buyer specifications

## Encumbrance Note
The hashmark (#) indicates this item can be packed together with similar items. Three such objects count as 1 encumbrance item.

## Availability
Ammunition is one of the most common trade goods in the galaxy, available on almost any world with TL2 or higher technology. Only the most primitive or resource-starved worlds lack the industrial capacity to produce basic cartridges.

## Usage
For game purposes, ammunition is abstracted - any projectile weapon can use the same ammunition supply, eliminating the need to track specific calibers unless the GM wishes to add that level of detail for their campaign.
