# Solar Recharger

## Quick Stats
- **Cost**: 500 credits
- **Encumbrance**: 3
- **Tech Level**: 4

## Description
This portable recharging station unfolds into a 2 meter by 2 meter square field of high-efficiency solar cells. Designed for field operations where access to power grids is limited, it provides a renewable energy source for Type A power cells.

## Physical Characteristics
- Folds into compact carrying case when not in use
- Unfolds to 2m x 2m solar collection area
- Durable photovoltaic surface
- Integrated charging ports for Type A cells
- Weather-resistant construction

## Technical Specifications
- Charges one Type A power cell per day
- Requires primary star of roughly Earth-like intensity
- Efficiency decreases in cloudy conditions
- No capability to charge Type B cells
- Automatic voltage regulation and safety cutoffs

## Deployment
1. Unfold panels on flat, unobstructed surface
2. Orient toward primary star for maximum efficiency
3. Connect Type A cell to charging port
4. Charging indicator shows progress
5. Full charge achieved in one standard day

## Environmental Factors
- **Optimal**: Clear skies, direct sunlight, Earth-like star
- **Reduced Efficiency**: Cloud cover, atmospheric interference
- **Minimal Function**: Dim stars, heavy atmosphere
- **Non-functional**: Underground, permanent cloud cover

## Field Applications
- Extended wilderness operations
- Remote outpost power supply
- Emergency backup charging
- Scientific expeditions
- Military field operations

## Limitations
- Cannot charge Type B cells
- One cell at a time only
- Requires full day for complete charge
- Vulnerable to weather damage if deployed
- Bulky when compared to charged cells

## Maintenance
- Clean panels regularly for optimal efficiency
- Check connections for corrosion
- Store properly when not in use
- Replace damaged cells immediately
