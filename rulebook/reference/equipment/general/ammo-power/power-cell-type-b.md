# Power Cell, Type B

## Quick Stats
- **Cost**: 100 credits
- **Encumbrance**: 1
- **Tech Level**: 4

## Description
Type B power cells are larger energy storage devices designed for vehicles and heavy equipment. Like their smaller Type A counterparts, they represent a standardized pre-Scream technology that remains in universal use throughout human space.

## Physical Characteristics
- Larger cylindrical design than Type A cells
- Heavy-duty connectors for high-power applications
- Reinforced casing for vehicle mounting
- Multiple charge indicators and safety systems

## Technical Details
- Designed for vehicle and heavy equipment use
- Cannot be directly exchanged with Type A cells
- Substantially different engineering from Type A
- Higher energy density and discharge rates

## Recharging
- Requires connection to ship's power plant or industrial grid
- Full recharge time: 24 hours
- Cannot be charged by portable solar rechargers
- Industrial charging stations available at most starports

## Common Applications
- Ground vehicles (6 hours operation)
- Grav vehicles and flyers
- Heavy weapons systems
- Industrial equipment
- Base installations
- Comm servers (several months operation)

## Duration by Device
- Standard vehicles: 6 hours of operation
- Comm server: Several months
- Pressure tent filters: Variable based on use
- Heavy equipment: Varies by application

## Storage and Handling
- More robust than Type A cells but still requires care
- Should be stored in climate-controlled conditions
- Regular maintenance checks recommended for vehicle-mounted cells
- Safety protocols required for industrial applications
