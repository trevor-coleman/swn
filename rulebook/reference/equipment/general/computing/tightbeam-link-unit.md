# Tightbeam Link Unit

## Quick Stats
- **Cost**: 1,000 credits
- **Encumbrance**: 1
- **Tech Level**: 4

## Description
Much like a remote link unit, a tightbeam unit uses a laser to connect via line-of-sight transmission. This technology offers near-perfect security at the cost of requiring unobstructed visual connection between transmitter and receiver.

## Technical Design
- Laser-based communication
- Line-of-sight requirement
- Precision targeting system
- Weatherproof housing
- Automated alignment

## Key Advantages
- **Undetectable** by conventional security
- No radio emissions
- Cannot be intercepted
- Quantum encryption capable
- No signal degradation

## Operational Requirements
- Clear line of sight mandatory
- Stable mounting preferred
- Both units must align
- No obstacles permitted
- Weather affects performance

## Range Capabilities
- Ground-to-ground: Limited by horizon
- Elevated positions: Extended range
- Ground-to-orbit: Possible with clear sky
- Indoor use: Impossible
- Urban environment: Highly restricted

## Satellite Option
- Commercial satellite reception available
- Cost: 500 credits per hour
- Requires skyward visibility
- Booking often needed
- Weather dependent

## Setup Process
1. Position both units with clear sightlines
2. Activate auto-alignment systems
3. Confirm laser lock
4. Establish encrypted channel
5. Begin data transmission

## Environmental Limitations
- Rain/fog severely degrades signal
- Dust storms block transmission
- Heat shimmer affects alignment
- Smoke interrupts beam
- Physical objects break connection

## Security Benefits
- No EM emissions to detect
- Impossible to intercept beam
- Physical access required to tap
- Attempts visible as beam interruption
- Perfect for sensitive data

## Comparison to Remote Link
Advantages:
- Complete stealth
- Higher bandwidth
- No detection possible
- Longer potential range

Disadvantages:
- Line of sight required
- Setup more complex
- Weather vulnerable
- No indoor capability

## Tactical Applications
- Covert data extraction
- Secure field communications
- High-security installations
- Wilderness operations
- Ship-to-ship transfer

## Common Problems
- Building vibration disrupts alignment
- Atmospheric conditions
- Bird strikes
- Equipment damage from exposure
- Power consumption in cold
