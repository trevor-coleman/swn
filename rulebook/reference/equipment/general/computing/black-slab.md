# Black Slab

## Quick Stats
- **Cost**: 10,000 credits
- **Encumbrance**: 1
- **Tech Level**: 4

## Description
While a "black slab" appears to be a normal dataslab to casual examination, these devices are packed with intrusion-optimization hardware and integral line tapping tools. They represent the pinnacle of commercially available hacking technology.

## Physical Characteristics
- Identical appearance to standard dataslab
- Concealed internal modifications
- Hardened against scanning
- Biometric security locks
- Self-destruct capabilities

## Technical Features
- Advanced intrusion hardware
- Integral line tapping tools
- Signal analysis processors
- Encryption breaking acceleration
- Stealth transmission modes

## Hacking Capabilities
- Functions as metatool for data line access
- **+1 bonus** to all hacking attempts
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Real-time encryption analysis
- Network mapping functions

## Integrated Tools
- Physical line tappers
- Wireless intercept modules
- Signal boosters
- Encryption crackers
- Trace detection systems

## Security Features
- Biometric locking
- Data encryption at rest
- Automatic wipe protocols
- False data partitions
- Anti-forensic measures

## Legal Status
- **Highly illegal** on most worlds
- Possession often equals presumed guilt
- Severe penalties for ownership
- Customs scanning may detect
- Law enforcement priority target

## Acquisition
- Black market dealers only
- Private sales from hackers
- Prices vary by local laws
- Quality varies significantly
- Counterfeits common

## Operational Risks
- Device may be traced to crimes
- Previous user data may remain
- Backdoors possible from dealers
- Law enforcement honeypots exist
- Rival hackers may target owners

## Professional Use
Expert hackers prize black slabs for:
- Corporate espionage
- Government infiltration
- Criminal operations
- Security testing (rarely legal)
- Emergency system access

## Countermeasures
Modern security systems often include:
- Black slab detection algorithms
- Hardware signature scanning
- Behavioral analysis
- Honeypot data streams
- Active trace protocols
