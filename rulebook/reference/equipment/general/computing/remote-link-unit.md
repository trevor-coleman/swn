# Remote Link Unit

## Quick Stats
- **Cost**: 250 credits
- **Encumbrance**: 1
- **Tech Level**: 4

## Description
These data broadcast link units have been preloaded with one-time pad security measures, advanced stealth circuitry, and sophisticated data progression algorithms. Two units working in tandem allow users to maintain contact with remote data storage or hacking operations.

## Technical Design
- Paired unit operation
- One-time pad encryption
- Stealth broadcast technology
- Data progression algorithms
- Hardened against interference

## Security Features
- Pre-loaded encryption keys
- Frequency hopping
- Low-probability intercept
- Anti-jamming measures
- Tamper detection

## Operational Characteristics
- Requires two units (one local, one remote)
- Maintains connection with remote systems
- Allows data storage access
- Enables remote hacking attempts
- "Stiff" connection limits flexibility

## Hacking Limitations
The security measures that protect the link also constrain it:
- **-2 penalty** to hacking attempts through link
- Reduced response time
- Limited bandwidth
- Cannot handle complex operations
- May drop connection under stress

## Detection Vulnerabilities
- Professional security systems can detect broadcasts
- Signal analysis may reveal location
- Extended use increases detection risk
- Moving units may break connection
- EM scanners can identify transmission

## Typical Applications
- Remote data backup
- Distributed hacking operations
- Covert communications
- Emergency data extraction
- Team coordination

## Range and Environment
- Urban: 1-2 kilometers typical
- Open terrain: 5+ kilometers
- Obstacles reduce range
- EM interference disrupts signal
- Weather affects performance

## Setup Process
1. Place remote unit at target location
2. Activate encryption synchronization
3. Establish initial handshake
4. Confirm secure connection
5. Begin data operations

## Power Consumption
- Moderate battery drain
- 4-6 hours continuous operation
- Standby mode extends life
- Type A cell compatible
- Heat signature when active

## Comparison to Tightbeam
Advantages:
- No line of sight required
- Works through obstacles
- More portable setup

Disadvantages:
- Detectable by security
- Lower bandwidth
- Range limitations
