# Data Phase Tap

## Quick Stats
- **Cost**: 5,000 credits
- **Encumbrance**: 1
- **Tech Level**: 4

## Description
This handheld device is normally illegal outside the possession of licensed data line repair technicians. The tap can detect data lines within walls and generate an energy manipulation field that allows wireless tapping for hacking purposes.

## Physical Design
- Handheld scanner configuration
- Digital display interface
- Directional sensors
- Field generation emitters
- Ergonomic grip design

## Technical Capabilities
- Detects data lines within 5 meters
- Penetrates up to 10cm of ordinary walls
- Energy manipulation field generation
- Non-destructive line access
- Real-time data stream display

## Detection Features
- Visual indication of line location
- Signal strength measurement
- Line type identification
- Data flow direction
- Encryption status indicator

## Tapping Mechanism
The phase tap uses advanced energy manipulation:
- Creates localized field distortion
- Intercepts electromagnetic signals
- No physical wall damage
- Maintains line integrity
- Undetectable by basic diagnostics

## Legal Restrictions
- Illegal for civilian possession on most worlds
- Licensed technicians only
- Severe penalties for unauthorized use
- Customs seizure common
- Some worlds ban entirely

## Legitimate Uses
- Data line maintenance
- Network troubleshooting
- Infrastructure mapping
- Emergency repairs
- Security auditing (with permission)

## Hacking Applications
- Bypass physical security
- Access isolated networks
- Avoid detection systems
- Tap high-security lines
- Corporate espionage

## Operational Limits
- 5-meter detection range
- 10cm wall penetration maximum
- Cannot penetrate shielded conduits
- Reduced effectiveness through metal
- Power-intensive operation

## Detection and Countermeasures
- Advanced security systems may detect field
- Shielded conduits block access
- Active monitoring can spot anomalies
- Regular line integrity checks
- Physical inspection reveals nothing

## Power Requirements
- Internal power cell
- 2-3 hours continuous operation
- Recharge between uses
- Power drain increases with wall thickness
- Auto-shutdown prevents overheating
