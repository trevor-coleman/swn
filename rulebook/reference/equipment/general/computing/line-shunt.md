# Line Shunt

## Quick Stats
- **Cost**: 100 credits
- **Encumbrance**: *
- **Tech Level**: 4

## Description
These palm-sized discs are roughly one centimeter in thickness, with an adhesive side that will stick to virtually anything and a polychromatic phased compound shell that shifts color to blend with surroundings. Essential tools for covert network access.

## Physical Characteristics
- Palm-sized disc form
- 1 centimeter thickness
- Universal adhesive backing
- Color-shifting shell
- Nearly invisible when placed

## Technical Features
- Phased energy manipulation technology
- No direct line contact required
- Works within few centimeters of data lines
- Single-use design
- Continuous operation until removed

## Camouflage System
- Polychromatic phased compound shell
- Automatic color matching
- Adapts to surrounding textures
- Effective against casual observation
- Specialized scanners can still detect

## Installation Process
1. Locate data line (manually or with scanner)
2. Place shunt within few centimeters
3. Adhesive automatically bonds
4. Color adaptation begins immediately
5. Device activates and maintains connection

## Hacking Applications
Line shunts are required for accessing well-defended systems:
- Bypasses physical line security
- Enables remote system access
- Multiple shunts extend hack duration
- Creates persistent backdoors
- Allows distributed attacks

## Operational Details
- Single-use only
- Functions until physically removed
- No power source required
- Passive operation mode
- Cannot be remotely deactivated

## Strategic Placement
Optimal locations include:
- Junction boxes
- Behind wall plates
- Under desks
- Inside cable runs
- Near server connections

## Detection Risks
- Thorough physical inspection
- Specialized EM scanners
- Network traffic analysis
- Regular security sweeps
- Thermal imaging (slight heat signature)

## Limitations
- Must be placed physically
- Single-use design
- No remote activation
- Limited to few centimeters range
- Cannot penetrate heavy shielding

## Encumbrance Note
The asterisk (*) indicates this item has no significant encumbrance. Multiple shunts can be carried easily.

## Legal Considerations
While less restricted than phase taps, line shunts are still:
- Controlled items on many worlds
- Illegal for unauthorized network access
- Subject to security screening
- Evidence of criminal intent
- Traced in criminal investigations
