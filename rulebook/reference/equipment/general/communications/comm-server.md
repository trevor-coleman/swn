# Comm Server

## Quick Stats
- **Cost**: 1,000 credits
- **Encumbrance**: 3
- **Tech Level**: 4

## Description
A powerful base unit for providing communications without comsats. The comm server creates a localized communication network that can support up to three dozen compads within its operational range, making it invaluable on worlds lacking satellite infrastructure.

## Technical Specifications
- Supports up to 36 simultaneous compad connections
- 300 kilometer operational radius
- Heavy encryption on all transmissions
- User authentication and access control
- Type B power cell provides months of operation

## Features
- **Network Creation**: Establishes local communication grid
- **Access Control**: Can lock usage to specific compads
- **Encryption**: Military-grade encryption standard
- **Range**: 300km radius coverage area
- **Capacity**: 36 device maximum

## Power Requirements
- Operates on Type B power cell
- Several months operation per cell
- Low power consumption design
- Automatic power management
- Battery status indicators

## Setup and Operation
1. Deploy in central location for maximum coverage
2. Initialize with security protocols
3. Register authorized compads
4. Configure encryption keys
5. Monitor network traffic as needed

## Security Features
- Device-specific access control
- Encrypted transmissions
- Anti-tampering mechanisms
- Traffic monitoring capabilities
- Remote shutdown options

## Common Applications
- Frontier settlements without satellites
- Military field operations
- Corporate facilities
- Emergency communication networks
- Covert operations

## Environmental Considerations
- Weather-resistant housing
- Operates in extreme temperatures
- Requires clear signal paths
- Performance degraded by terrain
- Urban environments may cause interference

## Limitations
- 300km maximum range
- 36 device limit
- Requires Type B power cell
- No satellite uplink capability
- Terrain affects signal propagation
