# Compad

## Quick Stats
- **Cost**: 100 credits
- **Encumbrance**: *
- **Tech Level**: 4

## Description
One of a host of different hand-held portable communications devices, compads are ubiquitous on TL4 worlds. These versatile devices serve as the primary means of communication, data access, and personal computing for billions across human space.

## Physical Characteristics
- Palm-sized device
- Various designs and form factors
- Durable construction for daily use
- Touch-sensitive display
- Integrated audio/video capabilities

## Functionality
- Voice and video communication
- Text messaging and data transfer
- Access to planetary data networks
- Personal computing functions
- Entertainment and media playback

## Network Requirements
Most TL4 worlds have global comm coverage, providing seamless connectivity planet-wide. However, compads have significant limitations:
- Require planetary comm grid or nearby comm server
- Useless on primitive worlds without infrastructure
- Limited to local network access only
- No interstellar communication capability

## Common Features
- Contact management
- Calendar and scheduling
- Basic productivity applications
- Media capture and playback
- Network data access
- Location services (where available)

## Power and Maintenance
- Integrated power cells
- Weeks of standby time
- Days of active use
- Wireless charging on many models
- Minimal maintenance required

## Encumbrance Note
The asterisk (*) indicates this item has no significant encumbrance. Dozens can be carried without hindrance.

## Cultural Variations
Different worlds produce compads with varying:
- Form factors and designs
- Interface languages
- Cultural applications
- Security features
- Network protocols

## Limitations
- Dependent on local infrastructure
- No function on primitive worlds
- Cannot communicate between planets
- Subject to local network control
- May require protocol adjustment on new worlds
