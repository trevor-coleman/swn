## Quick Stats
- **Cost**: 500 credits
- **Encumbrance**: 1
- **Tech Level**: 4

## Description
A combination of low-tech compasses, automappers, astronomic charts, and gyroscopes packed into a flat, one-kilo case. This device ensures that properly equipped explorers never lose their way, even in the most challenging environments.

## Integrated Systems
- Magnetic compass array
- Inertial navigation system
- Astronomical positioning
- Automatic mapping
- Dead reckoning backup
