## Quick Stats
- **Cost**: 50 credits
- **Encumbrance**: 1
- **Tech Level**: 3

## Description
A collection of straps, ropes, pitons, and other climbing aids designed to make vertical ascents safer and more manageable. While effective for climbing, the equipment's mechanical nature makes stealth difficult.

## Components
- Adjustable body harness
- Dynamic climbing rope (20m)
- Assorted pitons and anchors
- Carabiners and quickdraws
- Belay device
- Chalk bag and chalk

## Game Mechanics
- **+1 bonus** on Exert climbing skill tests
- **-2 penalty** to Sneak checks while climbing
- No bonus if lacking proper anchor points
- Can arrest falls with successful check
- Enables rope-assisted climbing

## Safety Features
- Distributes fall forces
- Multiple redundant connections
- Self-locking carabiners
- Dynamic rope absorbs shock
- Emergency descent capability

## Noise Factors
The Sneak penalty results from:
- Metal-on-metal contact
- Piton hammering
- Rope movement sounds
- Equipment jangling
- Verbal communication needs

## Climbing Applications
- Rock face ascent
- Building scaling
- Ice climbing (with additions)
- Cave exploration
- Emergency evacuation

## Setup Time
- Basic anchor: 1-2 minutes
- Complex route: 10+ minutes
- Emergency use: 1 round
- Removal: Half setup time
- Inspection: 1 minute

## Weight Support
- Single person: Safe
- Two people: Possible with care
- Heavy loads: Reduced safety
- Equipment hauling: Separate lines
- Emergency rescue: Reinforced anchors

## Maintenance Required
- Inspect before each use
- Replace worn components
- Clean and dry after use
- Retirement schedule for ropes
- Professional inspection annually

## Skill Synergies
Works well with:
- Athletics background
- Military training
- Scout experience
- Zero-G experience
- Wilderness survival

## Environmental Considerations
- Wet conditions increase difficulty
- Ice requires special equipment
- Extreme heat weakens materials
- Sand/grit damages mechanisms
- Salt water causes corrosion

## Alternative Quiet Options
For stealthy climbing consider:
- Grav harness
- Gecko gear (if available)
- Free climbing
- Magnetic grips
- Synthetic rope (less noise)

## Common Modifications
- Silent-running gear (expensive)
- Quick-release systems
- Powered ascenders
- Emergency beacon
