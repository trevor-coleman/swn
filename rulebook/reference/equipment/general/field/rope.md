# Rope

## Quick Stats
- **Cost**: 4 credits (TL0) / 40 credits (TL4)
- **Encumbrance**: 2 (TL0) / 1 (TL4)
- **Length**: 20 meters standard
- **Tech Level**: 0 / 4

## Description
Light and sturdy rope remains essential equipment across all tech levels. Traditional hemp or synthetic fibers serve at TL0, while TL4 versions use advanced materials offering superior strength with reduced weight.

## TL0 Traditional Rope
- **Cost**: 4 credits
- **Weight**: 2 encumbrance
- Natural fiber construction
- Variable quality
- Degrades over time

## TL4 Synthetic Rope
- **Cost**: 40 credits  
- **Weight**: 1 encumbrance per 40m
- Advanced polymer construction
- Consistent strength
- Weather resistant

## Material Properties (TL4)
- Cut/join with metatool
- Self-lubricating fibers
- UV resistant
- Minimal stretch
- Memory effect

## Strength Ratings
- Both support climbing weights
- TL4 has higher safety margin
- Shock absorption built-in
- Knot strength retained
- Abrasion resistant

## Common Applications
- Climbing operations
- Equipment securing
- Emergency rescue
- Construction rigging
- Survival situations

## Length Options
- 20 meters standard
- 40 meters for TL4 (same weight)
- Custom lengths available
- Field-cuttable
- Joinable sections

## Maintenance Differences
**TL0 Rope**:
- Regular inspection critical
- Protect from moisture
- Limited lifespan
- Fraying common
- Natural breakdown

**TL4 Rope**:
- Minimal maintenance
- Self-cleaning properties
- Decades of service
- Damage obvious
- Chemical resistant

## Field Modifications
TL4 rope can be:
