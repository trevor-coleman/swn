# Grav Chute

## Quick Stats
- **Cost**: 300 credits (TL4) / 1,000 credits (TL5)
- **Encumbrance**: 1
- **Tech Level**: 4 / 5

## Description
When this cylinder is strapped to a person or object and activated, it smoothly modulates falling speeds using gravitic technology. A single-use emergency device that has saved countless lives across human space.

## Technical Specifications
- **TL4 Version**: Safe descent up to 1,000 meters
- **TL5 Version**: Operates from orbital heights
- Weight capacity: 300 kilograms
- Single-use device (burns out after activation)
- Automatic activation available

## Physical Design
- Compact cylindrical form
- Secure strapping system
- Activation controls
- Status indicators
- Emergency manual backup

## TL4 Standard Version
- **Cost**: 300 credits
- Maximum altitude: 1,000 meters
- Civilian market standard
- Basic descent control
- Limited steering capability

## TL5 Orbital Version
- **Cost**: 1,000 credits (where available)
- Functions from orbit
- Military/specialty use
- Heat shielding included
- Enhanced control systems

## Activation Methods
- Manual pull cord
- Automatic altitude sensor
- Impact prediction trigger
- Remote activation
- Voice command (some models)

## Descent Characteristics
- Smooth deceleration curve
- Final landing speed: ~2 m/s
- Limited horizontal control
- Wind resistance included
- Stable orientation maintained

## Weight Considerations
- Optimal: Under 200kg
- Maximum safe: 300kg
- Overload: Faster descent
- Multiple units possible
- Load distribution important

## Single-Use Design
After activation:
- Gravitic elements burn out
- No repair possible
- Recycling value minimal
- Inspection shows usage
- Replacement required

## Common Applications
- Aircraft emergency escape
- High-altitude operations
- Combat drops (limited)
- Construction safety
- Extreme sports

## Environmental Limits
TL4 versions affected by:
- Extreme temperatures
- High radiation
- Electromagnetic fields
- Dense atmospheres
- Gravitic anomalies

## Deployment Sequence
1. Secure to body/object
2. Verify weight within limits
3. Check activation system
4. Deploy at safe altitude
5. Brace for landing

## Storage Requirements
- Climate-controlled preferred
- Regular inspection needed
- Expiration dates apply
- Pressure-sensitive packaging
- Tamper-evident seals

## Availability Issues
- TL5 versions rare
- Black market common
- Military surplus varies
- Quality concerns exist
- Counterfeit warnings

## Comparison to Alternatives
Versus parachutes:
- More compact
- Works in thin atmosphere
- No deployment issues
- Higher cost
- Not reusable
