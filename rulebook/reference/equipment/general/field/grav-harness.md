# Grav Harness

## Quick Stats
- **Cost**: 5,000 credits
- **Encumbrance**: 3
- **Tech Level**: 5

## Description
This advanced gravitic harness allows clumsy flight at a rate of 20 meters per round. While power-hungry and limited in duration, it provides unparalleled mobility for those who can afford its price and power requirements.

## Technical Specifications
- Flight speed: 20 meters/round
- Maximum altitude: Atmosphere dependent
- Lift capacity: 200 kilograms
- Power source: Type B cell
- Operation time: 5 minutes per cell

## Flight Characteristics
- Movement requires Main Action
- Clumsy maneuverability
- Hovering capability
- Vertical/horizontal movement
- No combat agility

## Power Consumption
- Requires Type B power cell
- 5 minutes operation per cell
- Rapacious energy drain
- No power-saving mode
- Instant shutdown when depleted

## Physical Design
- Full-torso harness
- Integrated gravitic nodes
- Control interface (handheld)
- Safety straps and buckles
- Emergency release system

## Weight Capacity
