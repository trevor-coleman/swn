# Instapanel

## Quick Stats
- **Cost**: 50 credits
- **Encumbrance**: 1#
- **Tech Level**: 4

## Description
In its compressed form, an instapanel is a two-kilo cube of ceraplast five centimeters on a side. When activated with a power cell, it expands into a rigid, waterproof sheet suitable for rapid construction needs.

## Physical Transformation
- **Compressed**: 5cm cube, 2kg weight
- **Expanded**: 2m x 2m x 1cm sheet
- Opaque ceraplast material
- Waterproof construction
- Semi-flexible for 5 minutes

## Activation Process
1. Insert Type A power cell
2. Immediate expansion begins
3. Shape within 5 minutes
4. Full hardening complete
5. Remove power cell

## Material Properties
- Tough ceraplast construction
- Completely waterproof
- Chemical resistant
- UV stable
- Temperature resistant

## Shaping Window
During first 5 minutes:
- Can be folded by hand
- Bent to desired angles
- Curved for specific needs
- Joined to other panels
- Cut with tools

## Bonding Capability
- Panels bond to each other
- Requires metatool or toolkit
- Creates seamless joints
- Permanent connection
- No adhesives needed

## Structural Strength
- Requires 12+ damage points to break
- Resistant to small arms
- Weatherproof indefinitely
- Load-bearing capable
- No maintenance needed

## Common Applications
- Emergency shelters
- Quick fortifications
- Water collection
- Equipment covers
- Temporary bridges

## Construction Uses
- Wall sections
- Roofing material
- Flooring panels
- Partitions
- Repair patches

## Field Techniques
- Overlap for larger areas
- Curve for strength
- Angle for water runoff
- Double layer for insulation
- Cut holes before hardening

## Limitations
- One-time use only
- Cannot be reshaped after hardening
- 5-minute working time
- Requires power cell
- Heavy when multiple used

## Encumbrance Note
The hashmark (#) indicates bundling possible - three instapanels count as 1 encumbrance item.

## Disposal Methods
- Breaks into recyclable chunks
- Chemical dissolution (special solvent)
- High-temperature melting
- Leave in place (inert)
- Construction material reuse

## Creative Applications
- Improvised stretchers
- Equipment sleds
- Boat hulls (sealed properly)
- Defensive shields
- Signage/markers

## Storage Considerations
- Keep dry until use
- Stable indefinitely
- Stack efficiently
- Protect from damage
- Mark with contents
