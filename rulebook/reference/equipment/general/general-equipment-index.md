# General Equipment Index

Most of the equipment listed here is available on any TL4 world. Even the TL5 items are among the simpler and more ubiquitous pretech relics and could likely be acquired on a sufficiently prosperous world with a good market in Mandate tech. Buying any TL5 equipment on the open market is subject to GM approval, however, and many worlds flatly ban private ownership of ancient Mandate technology.

## Encumbrance Notes

- **Hashmark (#)**: Items can be packed together; 3 such objects = 1 encumbrance item
