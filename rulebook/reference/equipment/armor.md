# Armor

Armor protects against the dangers of combat. Unarmored humans have AC 10. Characters add their Dexterity modifier to AC.

## Armor Categories

### Primitive Armor
Traditional armor lacking advanced materials. **Useless against TL4 weapons** - treated as AC 10 vs. advanced melee weapons and all firearms.

### Street Armor
TL4 gear that can be worn in public without social repercussions. Disguised as ordinary clothing or light enough to wear underneath.

### Combat Armor
Obviously military gear that cannot be disguised. Usually restricted to law enforcement, military, or licensed bodyguards.

### Powered Armor
Advanced suits requiring power cells. Provides immunity to primitive weapons and often includes additional systems.
