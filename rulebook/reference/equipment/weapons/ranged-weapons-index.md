# Ranged Weapons Index

Ranged weaponry makes up the majority of the lethal implements that litter the galaxy. Whether the primitive bows of a remnant colony on some desolate lost world or the sophisticated energy weapons of a modern interstellar freebooter, the ability to kill people at a comfortable distance is universally prized.

## Weapon Categories

### Projectile Weapons
Traditional firearms and magnetic weapons that fire physical projectiles.

### Energy Weapons

## Special Rules

### Burst Mode
Some weapons can fire in burst mode, allowing the wielder to fire three rounds of ammunition for a +2 bonus to hit and damage against the target. For projectile weapons, this means firing actual bullets, while energy weapons spread the beam or run the circuits hot.

### Energy Weapons
All energy weapons gain a +1 bonus to hit due to lack of recoil. One Type A power cell is sufficient to recharge an energy weapon's magazine. Laser weapons can be degraded by thick particulate matter like ash or sand.

### Grenades
Always roll to attack AC 10. On a miss, the grenade lands 1d10 meters away in a random direction. Explodes for 2d6 damage to all within 5 meters, Evasion save for half. Targets take 1 less point of damage for each point of AC above 14.
