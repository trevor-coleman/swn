## Description
Wheatcutter belts are one of several different antipersonnel measures often installed on gravtanks and other fighting vehicles. When triggered, a belt of explosives fires off a scything blast of shrapnel on any side of the vehicle. These defensive systems create a lethal zone around vehicles to counter infantry assault.
