# Railgun

## Stats
- **Damage**: 3d8#
- **Range**: 4,000/8,000 meters
- **Cost**: 8,000 credits
- **Magazine**: 20
- **Encumbrance**: * (vehicle mount only)
- **Attribute**: Dexterity
- **Tech Level**: 4
- **Special**: Can fire to suppress

## Description
Railguns are simply scaled-up versions of personal mag rifles. They accelerate large metallic slugs along the weapon's barrel, creating a steady spray of hypervelocity rounds. These electromagnetic weapons represent the pinnacle of kinetic weapon technology, delivering devastating firepower at extreme ranges.

## Properties
- **Suppression Capable**: Can saturate areas
- **Heavy Weapon**: Penetrates vehicle armor
- **Vehicle Mount Only**: Too large for infantry
- **Electromagnetic**: No chemical propellant
- **Expensive Ammunition**: 50 credits per round

## Technical Operation
- Electromagnetic rail acceleration
- Hypervelocity projectiles
- No moving parts in action
- Capacitor bank powered
- Heat dissipation critical

## Projectile Characteristics
- Solid metal slugs
- Mach 5+ velocity
- Kinetic penetrators
- Self-forging warheads
- Minimal drop over range

## Suppression Fire
When firing to suppress:
- Uses double ammunition
- All targets in area hit
- Half damage automatic
- Evasion save negates
- Devastating area denial

## Power Requirements
- Vehicle power plant
- Capacitor banks
- Surge protection
- Cooling systems
- Emergency batteries

## Common Mountings
### Tank Main Gun
- Coaxial configuration
- Turret stabilization
- Fire control computer
- Autoloader system

### Naval Weapon
- Point defense role
- Anti-missile capable
- Rapid traverse
- Radar guidance

### Fixed Emplacement
- Bunker installation
- Overlapping fields
- Remote operation
- Hardened position

## Advantages Over Chemical
- No propellant needed
- Consistent velocity
- Extended range
- No barrel fouling
- Weather immune

## Ammunition Types
- Solid penetrators
- Expanding rounds
- Incendiary slugs
- Sensor packages
- Submunitions

## Fire Control

- Suppression support
- Counter-battery fire
- Area denial

## Maintenance Requirements
- Rail alignment
- Capacitor service
- Cooling system flush
- Power system check
- Software updates

## Crew Operations
- Gunner
- Loader (if manual)
- Commander
- Maintenance tech

## Countermeasures
- Reactive armor
- Electromagnetic shields
- Rapid movement
- Terrain masking
- Smoke screens

## Limitations
- Power intensive
- Heat buildup
- Rail wear
- Vehicle only
- High cost

## Historical Development
Railguns represent the evolution of projectile weapons, using electromagnetic forces instead of chemical explosives. First deployed on naval vessels, they've become standard heavy weapons for advanced militaries.

## Engagement Envelope
- Direct fire weapon
- Line of sight
- Extreme range
- High velocity
- Flat trajectory

## Cost Factors
- Initial weapon: 8,000cr
- Ammunition: 50cr/round
- Power systems extra
- Maintenance intensive
- Specialized crew

## Battle Effects
- Sonic booms
- Impact craters
- Through-penetration
- Spalling damage
- Psychological impact
