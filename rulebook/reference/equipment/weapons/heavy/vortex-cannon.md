# Vortex Cannon

## Stats
- **Damage**: 5d12
- **Range**: 1,000/2,000 meters
- **Cost**: 75,000 credits
- **Magazine**: 5
- **Encumbrance**: * (vehicle mount only)
- **Attribute**: Dexterity
- **Tech Level**: 5

## Description
Vortex cannons use controlled gravitic shear planes to cause a target to simply fall apart into component fragments. The cannons are silent in operation but so heavy and complex that they can only be mounted on gravtanks and other similar dedicated fighting vehicles. These represent the pinnacle of pretech heavy weapons technology.

## Properties
- **Extreme Damage**: 5d12 - highest in the game
- **Silent Operation**: No sound whatsoever
- **Heavy Weapon**: Full effect vs all armor
- **Pretech**: Requires TL5 maintenance
- **Gravitic Technology**: Space-warping effects

## Technology
### Gravitic Shear
- Creates intersecting gravity fields
- Tears molecular bonds
- Instant disintegration
- Perfect cutting planes
- No debris scatter

### Silent Death
- No acoustic signature
- No visual beam
- No warning
- No defense
- Only result visible

## Damage Mechanism
The weapon literally tears targets apart:
- Multiple gravity planes
- Molecular disruption
- Instant effect
- Clean separation
- Total destruction

## Power Requirements
- Type B cells mandatory
- Massive energy draw
- 5 shots per cell
- Dedicated power systems
- Cooling critical

## Mounting Restrictions
Only possible on:
- Heavy gravtanks
- Capital ship turrets
- Fixed installations
- Specialized vehicles
- Pretech platforms

## Targeting Systems
- Quantum processors
- Gravity wave sensors
- Predictive algorithms
- Multi-spectrum tracking
- AI assistance

## Tactical Employment
- Ultimate tank killer
- Bunker destroyer
- Capital target elimination
- Terror weapon
- Decisive engagement

## Effects on Target
- Instant dismemberment
- Clean cuts through anything
- No explosion
- No heat signature
- Geometric destruction

## Psychological Warfare
- Silent elimination
- No trace of attack
- Unexplained destruction
- Absolute terror
- Surrender inducement

## Limitations
- Extremely expensive
- Pretech maintenance only
- Limited ammunition
- Heavy vehicle only
- Component scarcity

## Maintenance Challenges
- Requires pretech knowledge
- Specialized facilities
- Quantum alignment
- Gravity calibration
- No field repairs

## Historical Significance
Vortex cannons represent Mandate military supremacy. Few survived the Scream, and those that did are jealously guarded by major powers or lost in forgotten battlefields.

## Countermeasures
Almost none:
- Pretech shields (rare)
- Not being targeted
- Extreme range
- Terrain masking
- Surrender

## Crew Requirements
- Specialized training
- Physics understanding
- Quantum mechanics
- Years of practice
- Security clearance

## Acquisition
- Government arsenals
- Pretech caches
- Ancient battlefields
- Black market (impossible)
- Inheritance/discovery

## Legal Status
- Universally restricted
- Government monopoly
- War crime associations
- Treaties ban use
- Death penalty common

## Ammunition
- Specialized power cells
- Cannot be improvised
- Pretech manufacture only
- Each shot precious
- Strategic resource

## Battle Doctrine
- Reserved for critical targets
- Command authorization
- Strategic deployment
- Psychological operations
- Victory assured

## Famous Examples
- Siege of New Geneva
- Battle of Crimson Nebula
- Mandate Pacification Wars
- Lost Fleet encounters
- Legendary weapons

## Cost Reality
- 75,000cr base price
- If available at all
- Maintenance extreme
- Ammunition priceless
- Political cost higher
