- **Tech Level**: 3

## Description
Demo charges are the general run of placed explosives beloved of terrorists and adventurers the world over. The usual variety can be detonated by radio signals, timers, or electrical charges, and inflict their damage on any objects within twenty meters. These versatile explosives can be shaped by experts for directional blasts.

## Properties
- **Heavy Weapon**: Counts as Heavy vs vehicles
- **Area Effect**: 20m primary blast radius
- **Placed Explosive**: Usually not thrown
- **Shapeable**: Can direct blast
- **Multiple Triggers**: Various detonation methods

## Blast Zones
### Primary (0-20 meters)
- Full 3d10 damage
- Evasion save for half
- Structures heavily damaged
- 4-meter hole in normal walls

### Secondary (20-40 meters)
- Half damage (1d10+5)
- Evasion save for none
- Light structure damage
- Shrapnel and debris

## Detonation Methods
- **Timer**: 1 second to 24 hours
- **Radio**: Remote detonation
- **Electrical**: Command wire
- **Pressure**: Mine configuration
- **Proximity**: Motion sensing
- **Manual**: Direct activation

## Shaping Charges
PCs with demolitions background or Fix-0 can:
- Direct blast in one direction
- Spare all but 2 meters behind
- Concentrate force
- Minimize collateral
- Breach specific targets

## Common Applications
