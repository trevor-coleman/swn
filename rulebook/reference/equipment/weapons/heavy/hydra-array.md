# Hydra Array

## Stats
- **Damage**: 3d6#
- **Range**: 4,000/8,000 meters
- **Cost**: 20,000 credits
- **Magazine**: 15 (5 volleys of 3 missiles)
- **Encumbrance**: * (vehicle mount only)
- **Attribute**: Dexterity
- **Tech Level**: 4
- **Special**: Fires 3 missiles per volley, can suppress

## Description
Hydra arrays sequence a number of missile launchers to fire at once. The gunner designates up to three targets and can then make three rolls to hit divided among them. Each successful hit on a target allows the gunner to roll damage once, but only the highest damage roll is applied to the target. This creates a devastating barrage of guided missiles.

## Properties
- **Multiple Missiles**: Fires 3 per volley
- **Target Flexibility**: Split fire up to 3 targets
- **Best Damage**: Only highest roll applies per target
- **Heavy Weapon**: Full effect vs vehicles
- **Expensive Ordnance**: 150 credits per volley

## Firing Mechanics
1. Designate 1-3 targets
2. Make 3 attack rolls total
3. Divide rolls among targets
4. For each target hit, roll damage
5. Apply only highest damage roll

### Example
- 3 volleys at 1 target, 2 hit
- Roll damage twice (3d6 each)
- Apply best result only

## Missile Guidance
- Fire-and-forget capable
- Multiple tracking modes
- Terminal guidance
- Countermeasure resistant
- Smart target selection

## Suppression Mode
Can fire to suppress:
- Uses 10 missiles (special barrage)
- Area saturation
- Half damage to all
- Evasion saves apply
- Devastating coverage

## Ammunition Cost
- Standard volley: 150 credits
- 5 volleys per magazine
- Specialized warheads extra
- Reload time significant
- Supply chain critical

## Common Warheads
- High Explosive
- Armor Piercing
- Fragmentation
- Incendiary
- EMP (vehicle)
- Smoke

## Mounting Systems
### Vehicle Integration
- Automated loading
- Vertical launch
- Box launchers
- Rotating pods

### Fixed Installation
- Bunker defense
- Area denial
- Overlapping coverage
- Remote operation

## Tactical Applications
- Vehicle destruction
- Multiple target engagement
- Suppression barrages
- Area denial
- Psychological warfare

## Fire Control
- Multi-target tracking
- Priority designation

## Historical Development
Hydra arrays evolved from naval missile systems, adapted for ground combat. The ability to engage multiple targets simultaneously revolutionized vehicle warfare.

## Engagement Doctrine
- Priority targeting
- Saturation attacks
- Defensive barrages
- Breakthrough support
- Area interdiction

## Cost Breakdown
- System: 20,000cr
- Per volley: 150cr
- Full reload: 750cr
- Maintenance: High
- Training: Extensive

## Psychological Impact
- Overwhelming firepower
- Multiple explosions
- Smoke trails
- Sound and fury
- Morale destroyer
