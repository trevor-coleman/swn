# Anti-Vehicle Laser

## Stats
- **Damage**: 3d10
- **Range**: 2,000/4,000 meters
- **Cost**: 10,000 credits
- **Magazine**: 10
- **Encumbrance**: * (vehicle mount only)
- **Attribute**: Dexterity
- **Tech Level**: 4
- **Special**: Roll damage twice vs vehicles, use best

## Description
Anti-vehicle lasers are less useful against soft targets but excel at penetrating vehicle armor. These powerful directed-energy weapons focus coherent light beams to burn through the hardest armor plating. Against vehicles and other hard-skinned targets, damage is rolled twice and the better result is used.

## Properties
- **Heavy Weapon**: Ignores personal armor
- **Anti-Armor Specialist**: Double damage rolls vs vehicles
- **Energy Weapon**: Type B power cells
- **Vehicle Mount Required**: Too large for infantry
- **Long Range**: 2,000/4,000m effective distance

## Special Mechanics
Against vehicles and hard targets:
1. Roll damage twice (3d10 each)
2. Use the higher result
3. Represents optimal penetration
4. Finds weak points
5. Maximizes energy transfer

## Technical Specifications
- High-energy laser system
- Advanced focusing array
- Thermal management critical
- Continuous or pulse modes
- Adaptive frequency tuning

## Power System
- Type B cells required
- 10 shots per cell
- Vehicle power tap option
- Capacitor bank charging
- Heat sink mandatory

## Targeting Features

- Ablative coating
- Smoke generators
- Rapid movement
- Thermal decoys

## Historical Context
Anti-vehicle lasers emerged as traditional kinetic weapons struggled against advanced armor. The ability to deliver precise energy allowed engagement of heavily protected targets at extreme ranges.

## Engagement Priorities
1. Heavy armor
2. Command vehicles
3. Weapon emplacements
4. Aircraft
5. Fortifications

## Cost Analysis
- Initial cost: 10,000cr
- Power cells: 100cr each
- Maintenance: High
- Crew training: Extensive
- Effectiveness: Superior

## Battle Psychology
- Silent killer
- No warning
- Surgical precision
- Clean destruction
- Terror weapon
