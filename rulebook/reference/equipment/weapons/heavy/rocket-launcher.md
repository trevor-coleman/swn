## Missile Types
- **Standard**: Basic explosive warhead
- **Armor Piercing**: Shaped charge
- **Thermobaric**: Enhanced blast
- **Fragmentation**: Anti-personnel
- **Smoke**: Concealment
- **Illumination**: Battlefield lighting

## Targeting System
- Basic infrared tracking
- Laser designation option
- Wire guidance (older models)
- Fire-and-forget capable
- Manual override available
