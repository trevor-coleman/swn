- **Tech Level**: 4

## Description
Some sophisticated "conversion bows" use special materials to convert the kinetic energy of the draw into a force field "glazing" around the arrow, improving penetration. This TL4 technology bridges the gap between primitive projectiles and modern weapons, making arrows effective against contemporary armor.

## Properties
- **Force Field Arrows**: Energy glazing on projectiles
- **Enhanced Damage**: 1d8 vs 1d6 for standard bows
- **Superior Range**: 150/300 meters
- **Silent Operation**: No sound signature
- **Advanced Materials**: TL4 construction throughout
