# Distortion Cannon

## Stats
- **Damage**: 2d12
- **Range**: 100/300 meters
- **Cost**: 1,250 credits
- **Magazine**: 6
- **Attribute**: Dexterity
- **Encumbrance**: 2
- **Tech Level**: 5
- **Special**: +1 to hit (energy weapon), ignores 1m of cover

## Description
Distortion cannons are among the most sophisticated man-portable weapons designed before the Scream. These two-handed energy weapons rely on the same principle as spike drives, manipulating the underlying fabric of space to disrupt targets. Their most distinctive feature is the ability to ignore up to one meter of solid cover between the gun and its target.

## Properties
- **Energy Weapon Bonus**: +1 to hit due to no recoil
- **Space-Time Manipulation**: Warps reality to strike targets
- **Cover Penetration**: Ignores up to 1m of solid matter
- **Extreme Damage**: 2d12 - highest portable weapon damage
- **Line of Sight**: Must see or fix location within 1m

## Technical Marvel
- Miniaturized spike drive technology
- Localized metadimensional rifts
- Spatial coordinate targeting
- Reality distortion field
- Quantum tunneling effect

## Unique Targeting
The weapon can hit targets if:
- Direct visual contact exists
- Target location known within 1 meter
- Through walls, barriers, cover
- Around corners (with coordinates)
- Inside vehicles or bunkers

## Cover Penetration Mechanics
- Ignores up to 1 meter of ANY material
- No damage reduction from cover
- Penetrates shields and barriers
- Bypasses armor (partial effect)
- Cannot penetrate dimensional shields

## Operational Principles
1. Target acquisition (visual or coordinate)
2. Spatial mapping calculation
3. Metadimensional tunnel creation
4. Energy discharge through folded space
5. Target disruption at quantum level

## Power Requirements
- Type A cells mandatory
- 6 shots per cell
- Enormous energy draw
- Spike drive principles
- Capacitor array critical

## Firing Effects
- Reality ripple visible
- Air ionization
- Dimensional stress
- Electromagnetic pulse
- Temporal distortion (minor)

## Tactical Applications
- Assassination through walls
- Bunker neutralization
- Vehicle crew elimination
- Hostage situations
- Impossible angle shots

## Limitations
- Cannot create matter
- Line of sight or coordinates required
- Dimensional shields immune
- Extreme maintenance needs
- Component degradation

## Detection/Countermeasures
- Spike drive sensors
- Quantum field monitors
- Dimensional anchoring
- Pretech shields only
- Massive armor (>1m)

## Training Requirements
- Advanced physics degree
- Spike drive theory
- Quantum mechanics
- Spatial mathematics
- Years of practice

## Maintenance Protocol
- Daily field alignment
- Quantum stabilizer service
- Dimensional stress testing
- Component replacement
- Factory service only

## Acquisition
- Mandate special forces
- Pretech research facilities
- Ultra-black markets
- Government vaults
- Lost expeditions

## Legal/Ethical Issues
- Universally banned
- Possession equals death sentence
- War crime usage
- Assassination tool
- Reality damage concerns

## Historical Context
Developed for:
- Special operations
- Political assassination
- Ship boarding
- Siege warfare
- Terror weapons

## Psychological Impact
- Ultimate fear weapon
- No cover provides safety
- Paranoia inducing
- Morale destroyer
- Surrender motivator
