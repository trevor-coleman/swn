# Plasma Projector

## Stats
- **Damage**: 2d8
- **Range**: 50/100 meters
- **Cost**: 400 credits
- **Magazine**: 6
- **Attribute**: Dexterity
- **Encumbrance**: 2
- **Tech Level**: 4
- **Special**: +1 to hit (energy weapon)

## Description
Plasma projectors are the larger, two-handed cousins of thermal pistols. These weapons project magnetically-contained spheres of superheated plasma at targets, combining devastating damage with improved range over the pistol variant. The thunderous discharge and visible plasma bolts make them as much psychological weapons as physical ones.

## Properties
- **Energy Weapon Bonus**: +1 to hit due to no recoil
- **Two-Handed**: Rifle-sized weapon
- **Enhanced Range**: 50/100m vs thermal pistol's 25/50m
- **High Damage**: 2d8 plasma impact
- **Loud Operation**: Extreme noise signature
