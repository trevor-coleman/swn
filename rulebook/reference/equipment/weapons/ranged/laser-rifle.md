# Laser Rifle

## Stats
- **Damage**: 1d10*
- **Range**: 300/500 meters
- **Cost**: 300 credits
- **Magazine**: 20
- **Attribute**: Dexterity
- **Encumbrance**: 2
- **Tech Level**: 4
- **Special**: +1 to hit (energy weapon), can fire burst mode

## Description
Laser rifles are the most common type of energy weapon, offering superior range and efficiency compared to laser pistols. These weapons project phased multifrequency beams capable of penetrating ordinary mist or haze, making them reliable in various combat conditions. The ability to fire in burst mode makes them versatile battlefield weapons.

## Properties
- **Energy Weapon Bonus**: +1 to hit due to no recoil
- **Burst Fire**: +2 to hit and damage, uses 3 charges
- **Efficient Design**: 20 shots per power cell
- **Extended Range**: 300/500m effectiveness
- **Two-Handed**: Rifle configuration
