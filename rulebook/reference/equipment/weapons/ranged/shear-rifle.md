## Description
Shear rifles are the product of relatively few functioning pretech manufactories. These weapons use miniaturized grav projectors to create dangerous repulsor fields inside a target, tearing the object apart along perfectly smooth planes. The weapon operates in complete silence, making it a favorite of special forces and assassins.

## Properties
- **Energy Weapon Bonus**: +1 to hit due to no recoil
- **Burst Fire**: +2 to hit and damage, uses 3 charges
- **Completely Silent**: No sound whatsoever
- **Pretech Design**: TL5 manufacturing required
- **Gravitic Shear**: Unique damage mechanism

## Technical Marvel
- Miniaturized gravity manipulation
- Localized space-time distortion
- Quantum field generation
- Zero acoustic signature
- Instant effect delivery

## Shear Effect
The weapon creates intersecting repulsor fields that:
- Separate molecular bonds
- Create perfect cutting planes
- Ignore material hardness
- Leave mirror-smooth surfaces
- Cause instant structural failure

## Tactical Advantages
- Absolute silence
- No visible beam
- No environmental interference
- Penetrates soft cover
- Psychological terror

## Burst Mode Application
- Multiple shear planes
- Wider area effect
- Catastrophic damage
- Target disintegration
- Increased power draw

## Evidence Characteristics
- Perfectly smooth cuts
- No burn marks
- No projectile traces
- Geometric wound patterns
- Distinctive forensics

## Power Requirements
- Type A cells
- 10 shots standard
- 3 shots per burst
- High energy efficiency
- Pretech power regulation

## Operational Limitations
- Cannot penetrate heavy armor
- Limited by gravity fields
- Pretech maintenance only
- Irreplaceable components
- Detection by grav sensors

## Common Users
- Special operations
- Government assassins
- Corporate black ops
- Wealthy collectors
- Secret police

## Maintenance Challenges
- Requires pretech knowledge
- Specialized tools needed
- Cannot be field serviced
- Component degradation
- No replacement parts

## Detection and Countermeasures
- Gravity wave sensors
- Quantum field detectors
- Heavy armor effective
- Dispersion fields
- Pretech defenses

## Legal Status
- Universally restricted
- Possession equals intent
- Government monopoly
- Black market extreme
- Death penalty common

## Historical Note
Shear rifles represent the pinnacle of Mandate-era infantry weapons, combining lethality with subtlety. Most examples are centuries old, maintained by specialized technicians or automated systems.

## Acquisition
- Mandate-era caches
- Government armories
