# Void Carbine

## Stats
- **Damage**: 2d6
- **Range**: 100/300 meters
- **Cost**: 400 credits
- **Magazine**: 10
- **Attribute**: Dexterity
- **Encumbrance**: 2
- **Tech Level**: 4

## Description
Void carbines are designed for vacuum and zero-gee use, and have essentially no recoil. Their rounds cannot penetrate ordinary ship equipment plating, making them ideal for shipboard combat where hull breaches must be avoided. These specialized weapons are standard equipment for naval boarding parties and station security.

## Properties
- **Zero Recoil**: Perfect for zero-gravity combat
- **Ship-Safe Rounds**: Won't breach hull plating
- **Moderate Damage**: 2d6 balanced for safety
- **TL4 Construction**: Advanced materials throughout
- **Vacuum Rated**: Functions in space

## Technical Design
- Recoilless firing system
- Magnetic round acceleration
- Frangible ammunition
- Sealed construction
- No gas operation needed

## Specialized Ammunition
- **Frangible Rounds**: Disintegrate on hard surfaces
