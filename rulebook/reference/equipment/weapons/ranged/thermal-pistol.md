# Thermal Pistol

## Stats
- **Damage**: 2d6
- **Range**: 25/50 meters
- **Cost**: 300 credits
- **Magazine**: 5
- **Attribute**: Dexterity
- **Encumbrance**: 1
- **Tech Level**: 4
- **Special**: +1 to hit (energy weapon)

## Description
Thermal pistols replace the beam of a laser with a small sphere of magnetically-shaped plasma. These weapons project superheated matter contained in a magnetic bottle, delivering devastating damage at close range. The plasma spheres tend to dissipate at much shorter ranges than laser beams but inflict significantly more damage to targets within range.

## Properties
- **Energy Weapon Bonus**: +1 to hit due to no recoil
- **Plasma Projectile**: Visible sphere of superheated matter
- **High Damage**: 2d6 vs laser pistol's 1d6
- **Short Range**: 25/50m limited by plasma cohesion
- **Extremely Loud**: Thunderous discharge

## Technical Operation
- Plasma generation chamber
- Magnetic containment field
- Projection accelerator
- Heat management system
- Power regulation matrix
