# Thunder Gun

## Stats
- **Damage**: 2d10
- **Range**: 100/300 meters
- **Cost**: 1,000 credits
- **Magazine**: 6
- **Attribute**: Dexterity
- **Encumbrance**: 2
- **Tech Level**: 5
- **Special**: +1 to hit (energy weapon), bonus damage on high rolls

## Description
Thunder guns are named for the basso vibrations caused by their operation, a sound that can be felt as far as thirty meters away from an operator. This two-handed weapon uses grav plates to create rapid, randomized disruptions in a target that increase the chance of complete structural collapse. The weapon's distinctive audio signature makes stealth impossible but announces devastating firepower.

## Properties
- **Energy Weapon Bonus**: +1 to hit due to no recoil
- **Critical Damage**: Extra 1d10 on natural 16+ to hit
- **Always Crits Objects**: Bonus damage vs inanimate targets
- **Distinctive Sound**: Deep bass vibration, 30m radius
- **Pretech Weapon**: Requires TL5 manufacturing

## Technical Operation
