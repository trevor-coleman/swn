# Heavy Weapons Index

Some weapons are simply too big to be comfortably used without a tripod, fixed support, or vehicle mounting. Others require specialized training in the use of heavy munitions. The weapons listed here all use the Shoot skill to determine hit bonuses, and unless otherwise noted, all require some sort of support for firing.

## Key Features

### Power Requirements
Energy weapons use Type B power cells. Rocket launchers and hydra arrays use missiles, while heavy machine guns and wheatcutter belts consume large amounts of standard ammunition.

### Suppression Fire
Some heavy guns can fire to suppress. Double the usual ammunition is fired in one round, and every target in front of the weapon that is not under hard cover is automatically hit for half normal damage. A successful Evasion saving throw eliminates this damage.

### Vehicle Armor Note
When firing at TL4 military vehicles such as gravtanks, mechs, or starship armor, most TL3 Heavy weapons don't count as Heavy for armor-penetrating purposes. Demo charges and explosives do, however.

## Weapon Descriptions

### Heavy Machine Gun
Belt-fed projectile weapon requiring mounting. Magazine holds 10 rounds of fire, each consuming 25cr of ammunition.

### Rocket Launcher
Man-portable missile launcher, shoulder-fired without emplacement. Takes -4 to hit human-sized or smaller targets.

### Demo Charge
Placed explosive with multiple detonation options. Creates 4-meter hole in normal walls. Can be shaped by experts.

### Railgun
Electromagnetic projectile accelerator. Fires hypervelocity metal slugs. Ammunition costs 50cr per round.

### Anti-Vehicle Laser
Specialized for hard targets. Roll damage twice against vehicles and use the better result.

### Hydra Array
Fires 3 missiles per volley at up to 3 targets. Only highest damage applies per target. Volley costs 150cr.

### Wheatcutter Belt
Vehicle-mounted antipersonnel system. Area effect but does NOT ignore vehicle armor like other Heavy weapons.

### Vortex Cannon
Pretech gravitic weapon causing molecular disruption. Silent operation, extreme damage.

## Ammunition Costs
- HMG rounds: 25cr per round
- Missiles: 50cr each
- Railgun slugs: 50cr per round
- Hydra volley: 150cr
- Wheatcutter reload: 200cr
- Energy cells (Type B): 100cr

## Tactical Considerations

### Mounting Requirements
Most heavy weapons require:
- Vehicle hard points
- Tripod/bipod setup
- Fixed emplacements
- Crew operation
- Power connections

### Exceptions

- Demo charges: Placed/thrown

### Crew Weapons
Many heavy weapons benefit from:
- Gunner
- Loader
- Spotter
