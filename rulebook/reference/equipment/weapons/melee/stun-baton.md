## Description
Stun batons are common law enforcement tools designed for non-lethal incapacitation. The damage they inflict can drop a target to zero hit points, but will not kill them - the victim awakens in ten minutes with one hit point. These weapons trickle-charge from normal movement and will not run out of electrical energy under normal use conditions.
