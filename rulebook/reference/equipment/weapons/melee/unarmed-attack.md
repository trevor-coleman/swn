## Description
Unarmed attacks reflect ordinary kicks and punches delivered without weapons or special training. While generally less effective than armed combat, unarmed strikes have the unique property of adding the attacker's Punch skill level directly to damage rolls, making skilled fighters dangerous even without weapons.

## Properties
- **Always Available**: Cannot be disarmed
- **Skill Bonus**: Add Punch skill to damage
- **Minimal Damage**: 1d2 base damage
- **No Shock**: Ineffective against armor
- **Universal**: Available to all characters

## Unique Mechanic
Unlike other weapons, unarmed attacks:
- Add full Punch skill to damage
- This bonus applies only to damage
- Does NOT add to Shock damage
- Represents technique over power
- Makes high skill valuable

## Damage Calculation
1. Roll 1d2 for base damage
2. Add Strength modifier
3. Add Punch skill level
4. Total = damage dealt

Example: Str +1, Punch-2
- Damage = 1d2+1+2 = 1d2+3
