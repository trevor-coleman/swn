## Description
Suit rippers are rods with fractal cutting surfaces designed specifically to cripple vacc suit auto-repair routines. Every hit with a suit ripper counts as a suit tear on a vacc suit-wearing enemy. These weapons are strictly illegal in most space environments due to their potential for causing explosive decompression deaths.
