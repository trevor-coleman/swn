# Melee Weapons Index

Despite the relentless march of science, melee weapons are still useful adjuncts on the field of battle. They are silent, cheap, often easily concealed, and much more reliably murderous than firearms or laser weaponry. It's easy to miss a moving target in the adrenaline-fueled chaos of a firefight. It's much harder to go astray with a monoblade knife in your fist.

## Weapon Categories

### Weapon Sizes
- **Small**: One-handed, concealable (knives, clubs)
- **Medium**: One-handed, obvious (swords, axes)
- **Large**: Two-handed, heavy (claymores, halberds)

### Technology Levels
- **Primitive**: Ordinary metal/wood, ineffective vs powered armor
- **Advanced**: Monoblade/thermal/kinetic enhanced, ignores primitive armor
