# Lifestyles, Employees, and Services

Adventurers who spend much time in a place are likely to need to buy food, shelter, and the usual trifles of daily living. Rather than itemize each expense, a PC can simply spend a fixed amount for each day they spend living outside of a ship's crew, barracks, or other arranged living situation.

## Lifestyle Costs

| Lifestyle | Cost/day | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Slum** | 5 | Bare minimums for survival, with scanty food, a corner in a squat somewhere, and little else |
| **Poor** | 10 | Barracks-like quarters, public transport, and small and infrequent luxuries |
| **Common** | 15 | Private urban apartment or rural home, rented personal vehicle, respectable wardrobe, regular small indulgences |
| **Good** | 25 | Private urban townhouse or spacious rural home, better grade of personal vehicle, ability to indulge in minor expenses without concern |
| **Elite** | 200 | Entire floors of luxury buildings or rented rural estates, drivers and on-call gravflyers, personal staff, and similar perks |
| **Peerless** | 1,000 | Similar to pampered celebrities and oligarchs, with round-the-clock staff service, free entrance into the most exclusive locales, and the best of everything |

### Price Notes
Prices given here assume short-term rentals and contracts, plus the inevitable premium charged to outsiders in almost any society. Natives might be able to enjoy a given level of lifestyle for only half as much, but such savings usually rely on a local's connections.

## Employee Wages

PCs will sometimes need to hire help. The prices below reflect daily wages for NPCs with level-0, level-1, and level-2 skill ratings in their relevant professional skills. More talented employees cannot normally be obtained without special effort in finding and recruiting them.

| Employee Type | Wage/day (Level-0/1/2) | Notes |
|---------------|------------------------|-------|
| **Artist** | 3/10/100 | Musicians, painters, entertainers |
| **Programmer** | 10/30/100 | Software developers, system administrators |
| **Doctor** | 50/100/400 | Medical professionals, surgeons |
| **Guard** | 10/20/150 | Security personnel, bodyguards |
| **Lawyer** | 10/25/400 | Legal advisors, barristers |
| **Prostitute** | 2/10/200 | Companions, courtesans |
| **Psychic** | Special | Rarely charge less than 200 credits/day per psychic skill level |
| **Scientist** | 10/30/100 | Researchers, analysts |
| **Technician** | 10/30/100 | Mechanics, engineers |
| **Unskilled Labor** | 2/8/15 | General workers, porters |

### Employment Notes
- Psychics are both rare and expensive to hire
- Employees will carry out ordinary duties without demur, but will be no braver or more dedicated than their pay and connections would make them

### Service Notes

#### Bribery

- Particularly blatant or sensitive offenses might be impossible to solve with mere bribery
- The right "special favors" to the right officials might win a reprieve

#### Forged Documents
- Good enough to survive checkpoints and security stops
- Won't hold up to serious check by suspicious bureaucrat
- Include appropriate false database entries

#### Transportation
- Starship passage prices are per hex of travel
- Cargo shipping is per kilogram per hex
- Groundcar rental includes basic insurance

## Regional Variations

Prices for all services can vary dramatically based on:
- **World Tech Level**: Lower TL worlds may not offer some services
- **Local Corruption**: More corrupt worlds have higher bribe costs
- **Supply and Demand**: Rare services cost more
- **PC Reputation**: Known criminals or heroes may pay different rates
- **Bulk Discounts**: Long-term contracts often reduce daily rates
