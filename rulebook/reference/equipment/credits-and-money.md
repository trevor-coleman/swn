# Credits and Money

The value of goods is commonly measured in credits. Before the Silence, the credit issued by the Exchange of Light was the currency of exchange throughout human space. Most worlds attempt to mimic this currency to greater or lesser success.

## Currency Basics

For game purposes, the credits of different starfaring worlds are assumed to be interchangeable unless the GM and players care to embrace careers in the murky realm of interstellar currency arbitrage.

### Physical Forms
- **Electronic Banking**: Most common form - digital entries
- **Chips/Notes**: Physical currency on primitive worlds
- **Encumbrance**: 100 physical chips = 1 item

## Pricing Guidelines

Prices given for equipment and gear assume that they are being bought legally on a world capable of manufacturing such equipment.

### Tech Level Price Modifiers
- **Same or Lower TL**: Listed price
- **One TL Higher**: 2-3x price
- **Two TL Higher**: 10x price
- **Three+ TL Higher**: May be unavailable at any price

### Supply and Demand
Even primitive worlds can occasionally provide more advanced equipment to wealthy buyers, assuming they are not completely cut off from interstellar trade. However:
- Remote locations may have shortages of common items
- High-demand items may cost 2-10x normal price
- Rare items on primitive worlds are exceedingly expensive

## Alternative Currencies

Primitive or isolated worlds might not use or accept credits, instead preferring:
- **Trade Goods**: Useful items for barter
- **Precious Metals**: Gold, silver, platinum
- **Local Currency**: World-specific monetary systems

### The Trade Cycle
1. First merchants arrive with simple trade goods ("beads and trinkets")
2. Natives initially accept precious metals
3. Asteroid mining floods the metal market
4. Eventually, natives demand credits or useful goods
