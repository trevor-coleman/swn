# Creating a Heroic PC

When building a budding hero of interstellar legend, the usual rules for character creation are followed, with the changes listed below.

## Attribute Generation

To get their attribute scores, Heroic PCs roll **4d6** six times, dropping the lowest die each time and assigning the six scores as desired. If none of the scores are 18, one roll may be replaced with an 18. 

If the player would rather assign an array to their attributes instead of risking the dice, they may place the following rolls as they wish: **18, 14, 13, 12, 10, 9**.

## Class Selection

Heroic character classes are similar to their normal versions, but have additional benefits. The changes to each class are listed in the [Heroic Character Classes](heroic-character-classes.md) section.

## Hit Points

Heroic PCs have **half the maximum possible hit points** for their class, level, and Constitution modifier, rounded up. 

Thus, if a 3rd level Warrior could theoretically have 24 hit points at most, a Heroic Warrior of that level has 12 hit points. A first level Heroic Arcanist with Constitution 13 who could have at most 5 hit points would have 3.

## Foci

Heroic PCs get the usual number of foci at first level, but they can pick a new focus at **every even-numbered character level** instead of the usual progression.

## Other Rules

Unless noted above, Heroic PCs follow all the usual rules and guidelines for creating characters, gaining experience, and advancing in character level.
