# Challenging Heroic PCs

As a GM, your basic toolbox for challenging PCs doesn't need too much of an overhaul to handle Heroic PCs. The key thing to keep in mind is to make sure the group has a goal worthy of its prowess. A group of Heroic PCs is the sort of band to bring down a sector hegemon or win an age-old war against an implacable alien foe. If the group's ambition doesn't fit well as a tag line on a space opera, they may be thinking too small.

Aside from that, however, there are a few common classes of challenges that bear special mention.

## Social Challenges

Heroic Experts with a social-oriented concept are going to cut through most social challenges in a hurry. If their native skills and foci don't do it, their Heroic Expert class skill will. When such a PC breaks out their class ability, let them win if it's at all plausible. They may not get everything they want, and what they get may come with unpleasant complications, but they should never feel like they've wasted their effort when they employ their special abilities.

The key with social challenges is to think past the immediate situation. All right, so the Expert has the Chatelaine of the High Port eating out of his hand. She'll gladly support the party's expedition to the radioactive surface below the space station. The Chatelaine obviously has enemies, however, and there are doubtless all manner of people upset and troubled at this turn of events. The PC can't charm or bamboozle them all, and the deeper he insinuates himself into local affairs, the more enemies and potential allies he's going to encounter. It's all right for the PC to "win" the situation, because there is always another situation behind it.

## Investigative Challenges

Heroic PCs have the tools to beat a lot of mysteries, and if the Defying Doom rule is used, they might even be able to pull meaning out of an impenetrable clue if it's necessary to advance their goals. When you build mystery-based adventures for them, plan on the secret being learned rapidly, and make it more about the consequences of the discovery or proving it to others.

## Combat Challenges

Heroic PCs are going to mow through ordinary thugs and goons, especially if they have a Heroic Warrior among them. Large groups of enemies can still be a serious threat to the party, but one-on-one, common humans have almost no chance of winning a fight with the group. The simple existence of the Fray Die means that the group is going to take out its weight in 1 HD mooks every round, plus whoever they actually deign to shoot personally. Even when the opposition is a real threat, heroic damage scaling ensures that the PCs can survive a few hits even at first level.

As a consequence, most GMs will have a strong urge to throw major enemies at the group in combat; titans of war and legions of veteran soldiers, all to make the PCs genuinely sweat. To some extent, this is an appropriate part of the genre; space operas usually do have a large supply of more-than-human warriors. A GM should be careful, however, to make sure that these martial perils are logical and appropriate to the setting. If you've established that the city-state of Quar is policed by genetically-enhanced enforcers, then throwing a squad of 3 hit die street cops at the heroes is perfectly logical. If these grizzled veterans pop up only because the PCs had too easy a time busting the heads of the locals two planets away, however, it becomes more difficult to justify.
