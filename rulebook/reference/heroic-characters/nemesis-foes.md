# Nemesis Foes

Some enemies are special. Even the mightiest normal human is unlikely to have more than 10 hit dice and will be apt to fall swiftly under the guns of a party of heroes. For true challenges and the sort of dark perils that befit a heroic campaign, the GM can use Nemeses.

## Building a Nemesis

A Nemesis is built just like an ordinary NPC or alien creature, but has a few modifications made to its usual baseline combat statistics.

### 1. Hit Points

A Nemesis has hit points equal to its **hit dice times four**. The damage it takes is subtracted from these hit points, not hit dice. A grizzled veteran with 3 HD, for example, would have 12 hit points as a Nemesis.

### 2. Damage Output

All the damage a Nemesis inflicts is **read straight**, without conversion through the table. If that Nemesis veteran shoots a PC with a 1d8 revolver, the PC takes 1d8 hit points of damage straight.

### 3. Fray Die

The Nemesis has a Fray Die, usually **1d8**, though perhaps even higher or somewhat lower. This damage affects PCs and is inflicted straight. Thus, the Nemesis above could automatically do 1d8 damage each round to a single PC within range.

### 4. Attack Bonus

All Nemeses get a **+4 bonus to hit rolls**.

## Nemesis Power Level

A Nemesis does not have to be a high hit die foe. Even an ordinary trooper can be a Nemesis if they have some special significance, and you shouldn't feel obligated to make every Nemesis a 10 hit die, 40 hit point beast. Any adventure-significant foe could be a valid Nemesis, so long as they have importance to the party.

## Balancing Nemeses

- A single Nemesis will usually defeat any PC with the same level as the Nemesis' hit dice, though a Warrior can sometimes pull out a victory against a low-level Nemesis with few hit points
- They will probably defeat any two PCs of that level
- They will present a significant but probably-beatable challenge to groups of three or more same-level PCs
- If the Nemesis has multiple attacks per round, such as with an alien beast or superlatively-skilled warrior, they'll likely overcome one more PC for every additional attack they get
