# Defying Doom

Sometimes a hero is in a dire situation, one that seems certain to spell the end of their adventure. Maybe they've found themselves plummeting off the edge of a floating sky-city, or locked in a chamber that can only be unsealed by a particular species of alien, or confronted with a mission-critical text that can only be read by someone with skills they don't possess. In such situations, they may choose to Defy Doom.

## How to Defy Doom

To Defy Doom, the PC takes **1d4 damage per character level** they possess, rolling the damage and applying it immediately. 

- If the harm reduces them to zero hit points, they are instead left at one hit point and prey to the full horror of the situation
- If the damage fails to reduce them to zero hit points, they somehow survive or bypass their peril
- They can suggest a twist in the plot if they wish, or the GM can simply narrate their amazing stroke of luck or skill

## Escalating Cost

Pushing their luck this way comes at a price. The damage inflicted by Defying Doom **cannot be healed until the adventure is over**, and every time the PC Defies Doom in the same adventure, the size of the die they roll increases by one step. 

- First time: 1d4 per character level
- Second time: 1d6 per character level
- Third time: 1d8 per character level
- And so forth until the truly unlucky PC is rolling 1d20 each time

The die size does not reset until the adventure concludes or the PC abandons it.

## When to Use Defying Doom

Defying Doom is a mechanic that works particularly well for single-PC gaming, with just the GM and one player. Adventures often assume a band of PCs with a wide range of abilities, and a solo hero can have a hard time handling challenges that fall far outside their concept. 

If playing in a full group the GM may choose to disallow Defying Doom, as a band of Heroic PCs really ought to have all the skills they need for dealing with the situations they encounter. 

## Group Defying Doom

A Defied Doom that saves a whole party should inflict damage on all party members.
