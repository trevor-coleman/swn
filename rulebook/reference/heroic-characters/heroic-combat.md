# Heroic Combat

When the greatest warriors in the sector clash, common mortals fare poorly. Heroic combat shares almost all of the same mechanics and rules as normal combat, but it is very different in two important respects: the way damage is calculated and applied, and the existence of the Fray Die.

## Counting Heroic Damage

When damage dice are rolled in a Heroic campaign, they are not read straight. Instead, each die is compared to the table below and that much damage is done. If the roll has a bonus, the bonus is applied only to the highest single die in the roll.

### Damage Conversion Table

| Damage Die Roll | Damage Inflicted |
|-----------------|------------------|
| 1               | No Damage        |
| 2–5             | 1 point          |
| 6–9             | 2 points         |
| 10+             | 4 points         |

Thus, if a 2d8+2 mag rifle hit rolled a 5 and a 2, the roll would count as 7 and 2, inflicting a total of 3 points of damage. If a space wizard hurled a sphere of explosive thermal energy at a group that did 8d6 damage, each die would be counted, resulting in potentially 0 to 16 points of damage.

### Damage Application

- **PCs** subtract this hit point damage from their total as normal
- **NPCs** subtract it from their hit dice. Thus, that mag rifle hit would instantly drop a 3 HD veteran soldier
- Normal NPCs do not have hit points; they only count their hit dice
- Special "Nemesis" NPCs may have hit points and may be substantially harder to bring down

### Overflow Damage

Damage in excess of that needed to drop a target can be spread as overflow to any other target the initial attack roll could have hit. For example, if that mag rifle shot was enough to hit AC 16, it could bring down not only the first 1 HD thug it hit, but the next two thugs as well, provided none of them had an AC better than 16.

If the damage is area-effect in nature, it does not overflow. Each victim in range suffers the rolled damage. A grenade that inflicts 2 points of damage on its victims would wipe out any normal soldiers in range, but the excess would not be inflicted on any unlucky veterans among them.

### Fixed Damage

If the damage done is fixed for some reason, such as a hazard or a power that always does 10 points of damage, one point is inflicted for every 4 original points of damage, rounded down.

## Why Use the Conversion Table?

Why use the conversion table instead of just dividing damage by three or some other formula? Wouldn't that be simpler?

Stars Without Number is built to interface well with a wide range of other old-school games, many of which involve enemies that roll large damage dice or that have large bonuses to damage rolls. Using the table evens out these variances; a foe that does 1d20 damage and a foe that does 1d12+4 damage both work out to "a really big hit", while there is still a meaningful difference between a 1d4 knife and a 1d8 bullet.

## Healing Heroic Damage

Any healing effects, whether from stims or biopsionics, are rolled on the damage table and applied accordingly. Thus, a healing stim that would normally heal 1d6+2 damage will instead heal anywhere from 1 to 2 points of heroic damage.

## Lesser Foes and Worthy Foes

Some abilities distinguish between "lesser foes" and "worthy foes". The former is any NPC target with hit dice equal or lesser than the actor's character level or hit dice, while the latter is any target with more hit dice than the actor has levels or hit dice. Heroic PCs are never lesser foes, regardless of their level.

## The Fray Die

A Heroic PC is dangerous. Even the most pacifistic character is capable of besting ordinary foes when forced to it, and veteran combatants can take out half an alien bar without spilling their beer. The general halo of violence that Heroic PCs emanate is expressed in their Fray Die. This die represents the casual blows, snap shots, passing backhands, and quick psychic bursts that a Heroic PC employs even when their attention is focused on something else.

### Using the Fray Die

Once every round, as an **On Turn action**, the PC may roll their Fray Die and apply the damage to any single lesser foe within range of their weapons, fists, or abilities. For psychic powers and casual magical abilities, the usual effective range is out to thirty meters. If the damage is more than enough to drop the target, the overflow is applied normally to another valid target.

### Fray Die Limitations

- A PC's Fray Die can normally only be applied to lesser foes, as serious opponents are too skilled and dangerous to be dispatched so easily
- Classes that use psychic or supernatural powers, however, can apply their Fray Die even to worthy foes, as their abilities are less susceptible to being countered
- Ranged weapons that use ammunition don't expend any in the course of making a Fray Die attack. The blaze of gunfire is just part of the general scene, and unless the gun is actually out of ammo, it can be used
- Fray Dice are not modified by bonuses or penalties. A Heroic Warrior with a 1d8 Fray Die always rolls 1d8, regardless of their skills or attributes

### Focused Fray

As an option, a hero who is particularly determined to harm a target can use their Main Action to inflict their Fray Die damage on the enemy, whether or not it is a lesser foe. A PC who chooses to use a Focused Fray in a round cannot use their Fray Die in the normal way.

This option exists for those players who wish to avoid the potential frustration of a missed hit roll and are willing to accept the lesser damage of a Fray Die.

## No Shock Damage

Shock damage rarely fits the idiom of heroic adventure, so it is ignored for these campaigns.

## Heroic PCs Auto-Stabilize

If reduced to zero hit points by a theoretically-survivable injury, Heroic PCs always automatically stabilize. If hurt again, however, they die as usual unless the group has agreed on different rules for PC mortality.

## Vehicle and Starship Damage

Damage is rolled and inflicted normally for vehicular and starship combat, rather than referring to the table. In the case that PCs or NPCs are shooting at a vehicle, they roll their damage dice normally, apply the vehicle's Armor, and subtract the result from the vehicle's hit points. If a vehicle shoots at PCs or NPCs, the damage uses the table before being subtracted from the target PC's hit points or target NPC's hit dice. A starship-sized weapon shooting at human-sized targets is something that usually leaves only a rapidly-expanding gas cloud.
