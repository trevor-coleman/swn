# Heroic Characters Overview

## What Are Heroic Characters?

The default tone of Stars Without Number is that of gritty sci-fi. PCs are capable and talented men and women, but they are most emphatically mortal. They fail even when it's critical that they succeed, they die when people shoot them, and they have no particular narrative armor against the horrors of an uncaring galaxy. Even the most experienced PC is subject to the limits of normal human capabilities.

Not every group cares for that tone. Sometimes the players will want something more space-operatic in flavor, with heroes sporting the skill and prowess of action heroes and legendary icons in the making. Other groups will want to use Stars Without Number for particular settings or worlds where the PCs are just better than the rank and file of common humanity, more capable or more gifted. Some GMs might just want to run a one-on-one campaign with a friend or family member, ushering a single shining hero through their own personal arc of adventure.

For these groups, a heroic campaign is an option. In such a campaign, the PCs are a very distinct cut above the ordinary run of stellar adventurers. Even fresh from character creation, they can knock down ordinary foes and overcome challenges that would leave an experienced normal PC sweating. Of course, in such heroic campaigns, such talent is often a requisite for bare survival, as the dangers these heroes face are often far more dramatic than those essayed by ordinary humanity.

## When to Use Heroic Characters

It should be a mutual group decision to play a heroic campaign. Not every GM will want to run one, and not every player will want to play in one. Even so, if everyone involved is on board with the idea, the guidelines below will show you how to forge these brilliant starfarers and challenge them with fitting perils.

## Solo Heroes

A Heroic PC is roughly equal to four ordinary PCs of the same level when it comes to overcoming challenges and dealing with foes in combat. It's quite possible to run an adventure originally designed for an entire party with just a single level-appropriate Heroic PC.

As a consequence, some GMs might enjoy running solo campaigns for a particular friend, spouse, child, or newbie to the hobby. Using a Heroic PC can help the player get through events and situations that might summarily dispose of a single ordinary character.

GMs who do run solo campaigns are encouraged to keep rules like Defying Doom in mind, as there may be a number of situations where the hero lacks some crucial skill or is beset by some otherwise-inescapable difficulty. Repeated use of Defying Doom will wear the hero down until failure is inevitable, but judicious invocation can carry a hero through considerable lethal peril.

GMs who run solo games should also be prepared for things to move much, much faster than at a conventional table. With only one player to make decisions, choices come much more rapidly and events can veer much farther away from the expected baseline. A group will tend to correct for its most outlying impulses, with people moderating their choices so as to complement their fellow players. With only one PC, there's no such thing. Be ready to take the campaign in completely new directions should your player decide that some new goal is more enticing or some new place more interesting to explore. While this can be a challenge to GMs, it's also much easier to satisfy the play goals of only one player at a time.
