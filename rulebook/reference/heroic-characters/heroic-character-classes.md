# Heroic Character Classes

Heroic PCs follow the same class categories as their more human peers, but their abilities are even more pronounced. For instance, a Heroic Warrior has the same hit point bonus and extra combat focus of an ordinary Warrior, but he also has a lethally unerring eye against common foes and a reaction speed that ensures he beats any normal opponent to the draw.

A player should pick a Heroic class for their newly-forged hero when they come to that stage of character creation. The details given below describe how these classes vary from the normal form, in addition to details on the optional arcane classes in this book.

## Heroic Adventurers

As the normal Adventurer class, but a Heroic Adventurer can take **three partial classes**, or **one full normal class and one partial class**. Thus, they might choose to be a normal Warrior and a Partial Expert, or a normal Psychic and a Partial Arcanist, or a three-way Partial Warrior-Expert-Psychic.

## Heroic Experts

As the normal Expert class, but once per scene, the PC can treat any non-combat, non-psychic skill check related to their background or concept as if they rolled a **natural 12**. They may choose to use this ability after rolling the dice. 

**Fray Die**: Experts and Partial Experts roll **1d6** for their Fray die.

## Heroic Psychics

As the normal Psychic class, but Heroic Psychics have:
- One bonus point of maximum Effort
- Gain one extra skill point to be spent on psychic skills and techniques each time they advance a character level
- Can pick **four psychic disciplines** as bonus skills at first level instead of two

As usual, no single psychic skill can start higher than level-1 during character creation. 

**Fray Die**: Psychics and Partial Psychics roll **1d4** for their Fray die, but can apply it to any enemy, and not just lesser foes.

## Heroic Warriors

As the normal Warrior class, but their attack rolls **always hit lesser foes**, those enemies with equal or fewer hit dice than the PC has character levels. Heroic Warriors always win initiative in combat unless surprised or facing other Heroic Warriors. In the latter case, both roll normally and act before other combatants. 

**Fray Die**: Warriors and Partial Warriors roll **1d8** for their Fray die.

## Heroic Arcanists

As the normal Arcanist class, but gain one extra spell preparation slot for every level you are capable of casting. In addition, gain bonus slots equal to your character level; you can use these bonus slots to cast any spell you know, whether or not you've prepared the spell and regardless of the spell's level. If used to fuel abilities that require burning spell slots, treat them as slots of the highest level the Arcanist can cast. 

**Fray Die**: Arcanists and Partial Arcanists roll **1d4** for their Fray die, but can apply it to any enemy, and not just lesser foes.

## Heroic Magisters

As the normal Magister class, but you learn one extra spell per level you are capable of casting. In addition, choose one spell from every level you are capable of casting; you may cast these chosen spells as often as you wish, though you can't use them to fuel foci or abilities that require you to burn spell slots. You can change which spells you nominate for free casting with a day's work. 

**Fray Die**: Magisters and Partial Magisters roll **1d4** for their Fray die, but can apply it to any enemy, and not just lesser foes.

## Heroic Adepts

Because an Adept class tends to have so many unique and specific powers, it's not possible to provide a single easy template for scaling it upwards. Some GMs will be able to boost a given Adept class relatively easily, giving it additional abilities or giving them access to higher-level powers at a lower PC level. Other Adept classes are resistant to such changes. 

In most cases, the simplest solution is to let such a PC be a **Heroic Adventurer**, taking the full normal Adept class and then a partial class appropriate to their general concept. 

**Fray Die**: 
- If the Adept's magical abilities are mainly combat-oriented, their Fray die is **1d6**
- If the Adept's abilities are less martially-focused, their Fray die is **1d4**

In both cases, they can apply the damage to any target, and not only those who are lesser foes.

## About the Fray Die

These class descriptions include mention of a **Fray Die**, which is fully explained in [Heroic Combat](heroic-combat.md#the-fray-die). If a Heroic Adventurer has multiple Fray Die options, they can pick one to use on any given combat round.

## NPC Classes

As usual, most NPCs do not have a character class, and they most certainly do not have a Heroic character class. A soldier is just a soldier, he is not a Warrior. In some exceptional cases the GM might give class abilities to a particular NPC, but truly dangerous foes are more likely to be built with the Nemesis rules later in this section, the better to portray the dark and terrible foes appropriate to a space-operatic tale.
