## Quick Reference

### Power Level
- A Heroic PC is roughly equal to **four ordinary PCs** of the same level
- Ideal for solo campaigns or space opera tone

### Key Differences
- **Attributes**: Roll 4d6 drop lowest, or use array (18, 14, 13, 12, 10, 9)
- **Hit Points**: Half maximum possible for class/level
- **Foci**: New focus every even level
- **Combat**: Damage conversion table and Fray Die system
- **Auto-Stabilize**: Heroic PCs don't die at 0 HP from first injury

### The Fray Die
Each class gets a Fray Die representing casual violence:
- **Warriors**: 1d8 (lesser foes only)
- **Experts**: 1d6 (lesser foes only)
- **Psychics/Arcanists/Magisters**: 1d4 (any enemy)
- **Adventurers**: Varies by class mix
