# Ship Hulls

The chassis that forms the foundation of every starship, from nimble fighters to massive capital ships. Each hull class determines a vessel's basic capabilities and limitations.

## Hull Classes

### [Fighter Class](fighter-class/)
Single-pilot craft optimized for speed and maneuverability
- Strike Fighter
- Shuttle

### [Frigate Class](frigate-class/)
Small crew vessels balancing versatility with cost
- Free Merchant
- Patrol Boat
- Corvette
- Heavy Frigate
- Bulk Freighter

### [Cruiser Class](cruiser-class/)
Medium warships serving as flagships for smaller fleets
- Fleet Cruiser

### [Capital Class](capital-class/)
Massive vessels representing the pinnacle of naval power
- Battleship
- Carrier

### [Stations](stations/)
Fixed installations serving specialized functions
- Small Station
- Large Station

## Hull Characteristics

### Speed
How quickly the ship can maneuver in combat:
- **0**: Immobile or nearly so
- **1-2**: Ponderous movement
- **3-4**: Average maneuverability
- **5+**: Exceptional agility

### Armor
Base protection against weapon damage:
- **0-5**: Light or no armor
- **10-15**: Military-grade protection
- **20+**: Heavy battle armor

### Hit Points
Structural integrity and damage capacity:
- **8-25**: Small craft
- **40-60**: Medium vessels
- **75-120**: Large ships

### Free Mass
Available space for components and cargo:
- Determines what can be installed
- Varies significantly by hull type
- Limits ship capabilities

## Design Considerations

### Role Specialization
Each hull type excels at specific functions:
- **Fighters**: Combat and reconnaissance
- **Frigates**: Multi-role operations
- **Cruisers**: Fleet command and heavy combat
- **Capitals**: Strategic dominance

### Cost vs Capability
Larger hulls offer more potential but at exponentially higher costs:
- Initial purchase price
- Operating expenses
- Crew requirements
- Maintenance costs

### Size Limitations
Hull class determines what's possible:
- Atmospheric flight (Fighter/Frigate only)
- Landing capability restrictions
- Weapon mount limitations
- Component size restrictions
