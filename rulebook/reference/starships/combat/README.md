# Ship Combat

When starships clash in the void, the fate of crews and cargo hangs in the balance. Ship combat is a deadly dance of maneuver, firepower, and crew coordination across the vast distances of space.

## Core Concepts

### Combat Round Structure
1. **Initiative**: Roll 1d8 + pilot modifier
2. **Department Actions**: Each ship department acts in captain's chosen order
3. **Command Points**: Generated and spent to coordinate crew actions
4. **Resolution**: Damage applied, effects resolved
5. **Next Round**: Continue until one side retreats or is destroyed

### Ship Departments
Every ship has five critical departments:
- **Bridge**: Piloting, navigation, escape attempts
- **Gunnery**: Weapons targeting and firing
- **Engineering**: Damage control and emergency repairs
- **Comms**: Sensors, electronic warfare, communications
- **Captain**: Coordination and crisis management

### Command Points
The currency of ship combat coordination:
- Generated by department actions
- Spent to enable advanced maneuvers
- Represent crew efficiency and training
- Limited resource requiring tactical decisions

## Quick Reference

### Combat Round Timeline
- **15 minutes** per round in real time
- **Initiative order** determines sequence
- **Department order** chosen by captain each round
- **Simultaneous resolution** of some effects

### Typical Actions
- **Attack**: Gunnery department fires weapons
- **Maneuver**: Bridge department changes position
- **Repair**: Engineering fixes damaged systems
- **Jam**: Comms disrupts enemy targeting
- **Coordinate**: Captain boosts other departments

### Damage Types
- **Hull Damage**: Reduces hit points
- **Component Hits**: Disables specific systems
- **Crew Casualties**: Reduces department effectiveness
- **Critical Hits**: Catastrophic system failures

## Combat Flow

### 1. Pre-Combat
- Detect enemy vessels
- Determine initial range and positions
- Declare intentions
- Roll initiative

### 2. Each Round
- Captain chooses department order
- Each department takes actions
- Generate and spend Command Points
- Apply damage and effects
- Check for retreat/surrender

### 3. Post-Combat
- Assess damage
- Perform repairs
- Handle prisoners/salvage
- Continue adventure

## Tactical Considerations

### Ship Positioning
- **Range**: Affects weapon effectiveness
- **Maneuverability**: Smaller ships harder to hit
- **Cover**: Asteroids, debris, planetary bodies
- **Escape Routes**: Planning retreat paths

### Crew Coordination
- **Skill Synergy**: Matching PC abilities to departments
- **Command Point Economy**: Balancing generation vs spending
- **Risk Management**: When to attempt desperate actions
- **Communication**: Coordinating multi-department tactics

### Weapon Selection
- **Armor Penetration**: Against heavily armored targets
- **Rate of Fire**: Multiple smaller hits vs single large
- **Range Bands**: Optimal engagement distances
- **Special Effects**: Disabling vs destructive

## Common Combat Scenarios

### Merchant vs Pirates
- Escape-focused tactics
- Minimal armament
- Crew protection priority
- Cargo considerations

### Military Engagement
- Maximum firepower
- Coordinated fleet actions
- Tactical positioning
- Victory at all costs

### Rescue Operations
- Time pressure
- Civilian protection
- Limited engagement rules
- Environmental hazards
