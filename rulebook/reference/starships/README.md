# Starships

The vessels that carry humanity between the stars, from simple shuttles to mighty battleships. Understanding starship design, operation, and combat is essential for space-faring adventures.

## Section Overview

## Core Concepts

### Hull Classes
- **Fighter**: Single pilot craft
- **Frigate**: Small crew ships  
- **Cruiser**: Medium warships
- **Capital**: Massive flagships

### Component Types
- **Drive**: Spike drives for FTL travel
- **Power**: Reactors and batteries
- **Life Support**: Crew survival systems
- **Weapons**: Combat systems
- **Defenses**: Armor and shields
- **Fittings**: Specialized equipment

### Combat Mechanics
- **Initiative**: Ship class determines order
- **Actions**: Bridge crew coordination
- **Damage**: Hull points and component hits
- **Repair**: During and after combat

## Quick Reference

### Ship Costs
- **Fighter**: 200,000-2M credits
- **Frigate**: 500,000-5M credits  
- **Cruiser**: 5M-50M credits
- **Capital**: 50M+ credits

### Common Hulls
- **Free Merchant**: Trade frigate
- **Patrol Boat**: Light warship
- **Strike Fighter**: Combat craft
- **Bulk Freighter**: Cargo hauler

### Essential Components
- **Spike Drive**: Interstellar travel
- **Power Plant**: Energy generation
- **Life Support**: Crew survival
- **Bridge**: Command center

## Design Philosophy

### Modular Construction
Ships are built from standardized components that can be mixed and matched based on mission requirements.

### Resource Constraints
- **Power**: Limited by reactor output
- **Mass**: Hull determines carrying capacity
- **Cost**: Credits determine what's affordable
- **Crew**: Personnel requirements vary

### Specialization vs Versatility
Ships can be optimized for specific roles or designed as multi-purpose platforms.
