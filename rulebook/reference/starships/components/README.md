# Ship Components

The vital systems that make starships functional, from engines and life support to specialized equipment. Understanding components is essential for ship design and maintenance.

## Component Categories

### [Core Systems](core-systems/)
Essential components every ship needs:
- **Spike Drives** - Interstellar travel engines
- **Power Plants** - Energy generation
- **Life Support** - Crew survival systems
- **Bridges** - Command and control

### [Weapons](../weapons/)
Combat systems for offense and defense:
- **Energy Weapons** - Lasers, plasma beams
- **Projectile Weapons** - Mass drivers, torpedoes
- **Missile Systems** - Guided munitions
- **Point Defense** - Anti-fighter protection

### [Defenses](defenses/)
Protective systems and countermeasures:
- **Armor** - Physical protection
- **Shields** - Energy barriers
- **ECM Systems** - Electronic countermeasures
- **Point Defense** - Incoming missile interception

### [Fittings](fittings/)
Specialized equipment and modifications:
- **Cargo Systems** - Storage and handling
- **Sensors** - Detection and analysis
- **Communications** - Long-range contact
- **Utility Systems** - Special purpose equipment

## Component Mechanics

### Power Requirements
- Each component consumes power
- Limited by ship's power plant
- Overloading causes failures
- Power management critical

### Mass Limitations
- Components have physical weight
- Hull class determines capacity
- Balance affects performance
- Mass allocation strategic

### Installation Requirements
- Minimum hull class restrictions
- Some require multiple slots
- Installation skill checks
- Professional vs field installation

### Maintenance Needs
- Regular upkeep required
- Skill checks for repairs
- Replacement parts costs
- Failure consequences

## Design Considerations

### Mission Profiles
Match components to intended use:
- **Combat**: Weapons and armor priority
- **Exploration**: Sensors and supplies
- **Transport**: Cargo and efficiency
- **Stealth**: ECM and concealment

### Resource Constraints
- **Credits**: Purchase and maintenance costs
- **Power**: Energy budget limitations
- **Mass**: Physical capacity limits
- **Crew**: Operating requirements

### Redundancy vs Specialization
- **Backup Systems**: Reliability at cost
- **Specialized Equipment**: Maximum capability
- **Balanced Approach**: Reasonable compromise
- **Mission Requirements**: Specific needs

## Quick Reference

### Essential Components
Every ship needs:
1. **Spike Drive** - FTL capability
2. **Power Plant** - Energy source
3. **Life Support** - Crew survival
4. **Bridge** - Command center

### Optional but Common
- **Weapons** - Self-defense
- **Armor** - Protection
- **Sensors** - Awareness
- **Communications** - Contact

### Specialized Equipment
- **Laboratories** - Research
- **Medical Bay** - Health care
- **Workshops** - Repairs
- **Cargo Systems** - Transport

## Component Quality

### Tech Levels
- **TL3**: Primitive but reliable
- **TL4**: Standard modern equipment
- **TL5**: Advanced pretech systems
- **Alien**: Unknown capabilities

### Condition States
- **New**: Peak performance
- **Good**: Minor wear
- **Fair**: Noticeable degradation
- **Poor**: Frequent failures
- **Broken**: Non-functional

### Modification Potential
- **Standard**: Basic functionality
- **Enhanced**: Improved performance
- **Overcharged**: Maximum output
- **Jury-rigged**: Temporary fixes

## Installation and Maintenance

### Professional Installation
- **Shipyard Work**: Highest quality
- **Certified Technicians**: Reliable
- **Proper Tools**: Correct procedures
- **Full Testing**: Verified operation

### Field Installation
- **Emergency Repairs**: Temporary fixes
- **Limited Tools**: Reduced quality
- **Skill Dependent**: Technician ability
- **Higher Failure Risk**: Less reliable

### Ongoing Maintenance
- **Regular Checks**: Prevent problems
- **Part Replacement**: Scheduled service
- **Performance Monitoring**: Early warning
- **Emergency Repairs**: Crisis response
