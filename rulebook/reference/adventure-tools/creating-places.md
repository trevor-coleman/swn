# Creating Places

Places can be simple backdrops or complex locations for exploration. The complexity depends on how much the PCs will interact with the location.

## Simple Places
For backdrop locations where PCs won't spend much time:
- Use a name and few sentences of description
- Pull from world generation data already created
- Add background activity from tables below

## Detailed Places
For locations PCs will explore (alien ruins, enemy bases):
- Need more interactive elements
- Include rewards for exploration
- Add hazards to overcome
