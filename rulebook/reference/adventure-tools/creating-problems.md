# Creating Problems

Every Problem in an adventure boils down to a fundamental conflict. At its core:
- A person wants something and can't have it
- They don't want something and are being forced to accept it
- They have something and it's being threatened
- They want something and someone else wants it too

## Restraints and Twists

### The Restraint (d20)
Why the conflict hasn't boiled over yet:

| d20 | Restraint |
|-----|-----------|
| 1 | The government is cracking down on the conflict |
| 2 | One side seems invincibly stronger to the other |
| 3 | Both sides have "doomsday" info or devices |
| 4 | A prior conflict ended horribly for both of them |
| 5 | Foreign participants are keeping things tamped |
| 6 | Elements of both sides seek accommodation |
| 7 | The conflict is only viable in a narrow location |
| 8 | Catastrophic cost of losing a direct showdown |
| 9 | Each thinks they'll win without further exertion |
| 10 | They expect a better opening to appear soon |
| 11 | Former ties of friendship or family restrain them |
| 12 | Religious principles are constraining them |
| 13 | One side's still licking their wounds after a failure |
| 14 | They're building up force to make sure they win |
| 15 | Their cultural context makes open struggle hard |
| 16 | They expect an outside power to hand them a win |
| 17 | They're still searching for a way to get at their goal |
| 18 | One side mistakenly thinks they've already won |
| 19 | A side is busy integrating a recent success |
| 20 | An outside power threatens both sides |

### The Twist (d20)
Complications to shake up assumptions:

| d20 | Twist |
|-----|-------|
| 1 | There's a very sharp time limit for any resolution |
| 2 | The sympathetic side is actually a bunch of bastards |
| 3 | There's an easy but very repugnant solution to hand |
| 4 | PC success means a big benefit to a hostile group |
| 5 | The real bone of contention is hidden from most |
| 6 | A sympathetic figure's on an unsympathetic side |
| 7 | There's a profitable chance for PCs to turn traitor |
| 8 | The "winner" will actually get in terrible trouble |
| 9 | There's a very appealing third party in the mix |
| 10 | The PCs could really profit off the focus of the strife |
| 11 | The PCs are mistaken for an involved group |
| 12 | Somebody plans on screwing over the PCs |
| 13 | Both sides think the PCs are working for them |
| 14 | A side wants to use the PCs as a distraction for foes |
| 15 | The PCs' main contact is mistrusted by their allies |
| 16 | If the other side can't get it, they'll destroy it |
| 17 | The focus isn't nearly as valuable as both sides think |
| 18 | The focus somehow has its own will and goals |
| 19 | Victory will drastically change one of the sides |
| 20 | Actually, there is no twist. It's all exactly as it seems |

## Usage Tips
- Insert world elements you've already created
- Use Enemies for antagonists, Friends for allies
- Add Complications when you need additional twists
- Some Problems can be stored as filler adventures with sufficient Restraints
