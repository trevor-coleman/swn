# Adventure Creation Overview

## Purpose
This system provides a structured method for creating adventures in Stars Without Number. While not the only way to devise an adventure, it offers a reliable procedure for working GMs.

## Process Steps

### 1. Identify Your Needs
- Determine what the adventure needs to accomplish
- Consider player goals from the previous session
- Account for first adventures, backup content, or specific campaign needs
- Handle impractical player goals by suggesting alternatives or preparing filler content

### 2. Choose Ingredients
- Use sector information and planetary tags
- Pull from existing NPCs, complications, and places
- Customize ingredients to fit current circumstances
- Include callbacks to prior adventures
- Ensure logical connections to the campaign setting

### 3. Assemble the Outline
- Create a basic premise and identify needed information
- Use three core elements:
  - **Problem**: The unstable situation PCs can affect
  - **Person**: Antagonist or entry point to the problem
  - **Place**: Setting for the events
- Problems should be small/specific enough for PC actions to matter

## Quick Reference
- Use plot seeds (100 available) for rapid creation
- Slot world elements into appropriate seeds
- Remember: Adventures are created to be playable content
