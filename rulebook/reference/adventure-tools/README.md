## Adventure Creation Process

### 1. Identify Your Needs
- What does the adventure need to accomplish?
- What did players express interest in?
- Do you need backup/filler content?

### 2. Choose Your Ingredients
- Pull from existing world elements
- Use Friends, Enemies, Complications, Things, and Places
- Include callbacks to previous adventures

### 3. Build Your Framework
Every adventure needs:
- **Problem** - The conflict PCs can affect
- **Person** - Key NPC to drive engagement
- **Place** - Where events unfold

### 4. Add Details
- Generate NPCs with motivations and hooks
- Create locations with rewards and hazards
- Add restraints and twists to problems

## Quick Generators

### Need a Problem?
Roll 1d8 for conflict type (Money, Revenge, Power, etc.), then use the tables in [Creating Problems](creating-problems.md).

### Need an NPC?
Roll or choose:
1. **Motivation** - What drives them
2. **Want** - What they need now
3. **Power** - How they can help/hurt PCs
4. **Hook** - What makes them memorable

### Need a Location?
1. Choose type (civilized/wilderness)
2. Roll for ongoing activity
3. Add rewards for exploration
4. Include appropriate hazards

## Using Plot Seeds
The [100 Plot Seeds](plot-seeds.md) provide complete adventure frameworks. Simply:
1. Choose a seed that fits your needs
2. Slot in your campaign's NPCs as Friend/Enemy
3. Use existing locations as Places
4. Add specific Things and Complications

## Tips for Success
- Keep adventures sized for one session
- Ensure PC actions can meaningfully affect outcomes
- Include multiple solution paths
- Add at least one callback to prior events
- Scale rewards to match risks
