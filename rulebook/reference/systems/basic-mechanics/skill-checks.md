# Skill Checks

Most characters are skilled, competent people who can handle the ordinary duties of their role. Sometimes, however, they face challenges beyond the usual scope and must make a skill check.

## Basic Skill Check Mechanics

### Rolling a Skill Check
To make a skill check:
1. Roll 2d6
2. Add relevant skill level (0-4)
3. Add relevant attribute modifier (-2 to +2)
4. Compare total to difficulty number
5. Equal or higher = success

**Formula**: 2d6 + Skill + Attribute Modifier â‰¥ Difficulty

### Untrained Attempts
- If you lack even level-0 in the skill: -1 penalty
- Some technical/esoteric skills cannot be attempted untrained
- GM determines if untrained attempts are possible

## Difficulty Numbers

| DC | Difficulty | Description |
|----|------------|-------------|
| 6 | Trivial | Simple task beyond regular background |
| 8 | Easy | Significant challenge for competent professional |
| 10 | Average | Too difficult except for skilled experts |
| 12 | Hard | Only masters succeed reliably |
| 14+ | Extreme | Masters have a chance, but likely fail |

## When to Call for Checks

### Don't Roll If...
- Task falls within PC's background/profession
- Failure would make PC seem incompetent at their role
- Success/failure doesn't produce interesting results
- Outcome doesn't really matter to the game

### Do Roll When...
- Task exceeds normal professional competence
- Circumstances are especially hostile
- Situation adds unusual complications
- Multiple valid approaches exist
- Stakes are meaningful

### Background Examples
**No Roll Needed**:
- Pilot landing a ship normally
- Doctor treating common injuries
- Soldier maintaining weapons
- Merchant appraising common goods

**Roll Required**:
- Pilot landing in a sandstorm
- Doctor treating alien plague
- Soldier repairing alien weapon
- Merchant detecting forgeries

## Choosing Skills and Attributes

### Multiple Valid Skills
Some tasks suit multiple skills:
- **Javelin Contest**: Exert (athletic), Shoot (ranged), or Stab (thrown)
- **Engine Search**: Notice (observation), Fix (mechanical), or Pilot (familiarity)
- **Social Gathering**: Talk (persuasion), Perform (entertainment), or Connect (networking)

Players choose their best applicable skill.

### Peripheral Skills
Sometimes a skill is tangentially relevant:
- Usually increases difficulty by +2
- GM determines if applicable
- Player must justify the connection

### Attribute Selection
Choose the most logical attribute:
- **Physical tasks**: Strength or Dexterity
- **Mental tasks**: Intelligence or Wisdom
- **Social tasks**: Charisma
- **Endurance tasks**: Constitution

## Modifiers

### Circumstance Modifiers
**Favorable Conditions** (+1 to +2):
- Perfect tools for the job
- Ample time to work
- Ideal environment
- Expert assistance

**Hostile Conditions** (-1 to -2):
- Improvised tools
- Time pressure
- Dangerous environment
- Active interference

### Maximum Modifiers
- Total modifiers rarely exceed +2 or -2
- Exceptional circumstances might justify more
- Multiple small modifiers don't stack infinitely

## Special Situations

### Extended Tasks
Some tasks take time:
- Each check represents progress
- Multiple successes needed
- Failures might not stop progress but add complications

### Group Efforts
When multiple people work together:
- Lead character makes primary check
- Others can aid (see [Aiding Others](aiding-others.md))
- Maximum +1 bonus from help

### Retrying Checks
- Generally can't retry without circumstances changing
- Failed attempts might make things worse
- Some tasks explicitly allow retries
- Time often prevents multiple attempts

## Skill Check Results

### Success
- Task accomplished as intended
- Player describes how they succeed
- May gain additional benefits on high rolls

### Failure
Failure doesn't always mean complete defeat:
- **Task fails**: Can't pick lock, don't notice clue
- **Success with cost**: Pick lock but trigger alarm
- **Partial success**: Get some but not all information
- **Complication**: Succeed but create new problem

GM determines specific failure results.

### Critical Results
Stars Without Number doesn't use critical successes/failures for skill checks:
- Natural 12 is just a good roll
- Natural 2 is just a bad roll
- No special effects beyond normal success/failure

## Common Skill Checks

### Physical Challenges
- **Climbing**: Str/Exert, DC 8-12
- **Swimming**: Str/Exert, DC 6-10
- **Balancing**: Dex/Exert, DC 8-10
- **Stealth**: Dex/Sneak, opposed

### Mental Challenges
- **Research**: Int/Know, DC 8-12
- **Navigation**: Int/Pilot, DC 8-10
- **First Aid**: Int/Heal, DC 8
- **Hacking**: Int/Program, DC 10-14

### Social Challenges
- **Persuasion**: Cha/Talk, DC varies
- **Deception**: Cha/Talk, opposed
- **Intimidation**: Cha/Talk or Str/Talk
- **Gathering Info**: Cha/Connect, DC 8-10

## Quick Resolution

### Taking Average
In non-stressful situations:
- Can "take 7" instead of rolling
- Add skill and attribute as normal
- Only if you have time and no pressure
- Represents careful, methodical approach

### Automatic Success
Some tasks are automatic for skilled characters:
- Skill + Attribute + 7 meets DC
- No unusual pressures
- Failure wouldn't be interesting
- GM can simply declare success
