# Saving Throws

There are times when only luck or natural hardiness can save a hero from disaster. When misfortune or unpredictable peril befalls a character, they must make a saving throw to avoid or mitigate the danger.

## Types of Saving Throws

### Physical Save
**Tests endurance and health**
- Poisons and toxins
- Diseases and plagues
- Radiation exposure
- Extreme exhaustion
- Physical transformation
- Bodily system shock

**Modified by**: Better of Strength or Constitution

### Evasion Save
**Tests speed and reflexes**
- Explosions and area attacks
- Falling hazards
- Collapsing structures
- Surprise attacks
- Environmental dangers
- Avoiding traps

**Modified by**: Better of Dexterity or Intelligence

### Mental Save
**Tests willpower and perception**
- Psychic powers
- Mind control technology
- Illusions and hallucinations
- Fear and panic
- Mental intrusions
- Anything that doesn't fit elsewhere

**Modified by**: Better of Wisdom or Charisma

## Saving Throw Mechanics

### Base Save Scores
All saves start at 15 for 1st level characters:
- **Level 1**: Save 15
- **Level 2**: Save 14
- **Level 3**: Save 13
- Each level: -1 to all saves
- **Level 10**: Save 6

### Calculating Your Save
1. Start with base (15 at level 1)
2. Subtract your level minus 1
3. Subtract best attribute modifier
4. Result is your target number

**Example**: 1st level character with Con 14 (+1)
- Base: 15
- Level adjustment: -0 (level 1)
- Attribute: -1 (Constitution bonus)
- **Physical Save**: 14

### Making a Save
1. Roll 1d20
2. Try to equal or exceed your save score
3. Natural 1 always fails
4. Natural 20 always succeeds

## When Saves Apply

### GM Discretion
The GM decides when saves are appropriate:
- Not all dangers allow saves
- Some effects are automatic
- Story needs may override
- Player actions might prevent need

### No Save Situations
Some dangers don't allow saves:
- Direct weapon damage
- Falling into lava
- Nuclear explosion at ground zero
- Vacuum without suit
- Some powerful psychic effects

### Multiple Save Effects
Some hazards might require multiple saves:
- Save or die, failure means save or unconscious
- Ongoing effects requiring saves each round
- Graduated effects with different save DCs
