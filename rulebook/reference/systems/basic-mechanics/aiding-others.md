# Aiding Others

Sometimes one PC wants to help another attempt a difficult task. Working together, heroes can overcome challenges that would defeat them individually.

## Basic Aid Mechanics

### How to Help
1. Describe how you're helping
2. GM determines if help makes sense
3. Roll skill check vs same DC
4. Success grants +1 to ally's roll
5. Multiple helpers still only grant +1 total

### Requirements
To aid another, you must:
- Be in position to help
- Have a reasonable way to assist
- Not be occupied with other tasks
- Act before the main character

## Types of Assistance

### Direct Assistance
Using the same skill to help:
- **Two hackers on one system**: Both use Program
- **Lifting heavy object together**: Both use Exert
- **Searching room**: Both use Notice
- **Intimidating target**: Both use Talk

### Indirect Assistance
Using different skills creatively:
- **Talk to help Sneak**: Distract guards
- **Program to help Fix**: Run diagnostics
- **Know to help Heal**: Recall medical facts
- **Connect to help Talk**: Provide insider info

### Preparatory Help
Setting up for success:
- Research before negotiation
- Scout before infiltration  
- Gather tools before repair
- Create distraction before theft

## When Help Doesn't Help

### Solo Tasks
Some things can't be aided:
- Fitting through narrow space
- Resisting mental intrusion
- Personal athletic feats
- Individual perception
- Making saving throws

### Too Many Cooks
More helpers don't increase bonus:
- Maximum +1 regardless of helpers
- Might even hinder if crowded
- GM may limit number who can try
- Failed help might impose penalties

### Incompatible Methods
Help must make sense:
- Can't help Sneak by shouting
- Can't help Fix by breaking things
- Can't help Talk by threatening
- Unless creative explanation works

## Creative Assistance Examples

### Physical Tasks
**Climbing** (Exert to help Exert):
- Boost from below
- Guide from above
- Secure safety rope
- Call out handholds

**Heavy Lifting** (Exert to help Exert):
- Direct strength assistance
- Leverage with tools
- Coordinate timing
- Share load

**Sneaking** (various skills):
- Talk: Create distraction
- Program: Loop cameras
- Throw objects for noise
- Scout ahead

### Mental Tasks
**Research** (Know to help Know):
- Check different sources
- Cross-reference data
- Share expertise
- Organize findings

**Hacking** (Program variations):
- Program: Write code together
- Fix: Hardware access
- Know: System expertise
- Talk: Social engineering

**Medical** (Heal variations):
- Heal: Direct assistance
- Know: Medical knowledge
- Fix: Improvise tools
- Exert: Hold patient

### Social Tasks
**Negotiation** (Talk variations):
- Talk: Good cop/bad cop
- Connect: Inside information
- Know: Cultural awareness
- Trade: Market knowledge

**Deception** (Talk variations):
- Talk: Corroborate story
- Perform: Create scene
- Sneak: Plant evidence
- Connect: False references

**Intimidation** (Talk variations):
- Talk: Verbal support
- Exert: Loom menacingly
- Shoot: Display weapons
- Connect: Reveal knowledge

## Timing and Order

### Before the Check
Helper must act first:
1. Helper describes action
2. Helper rolls
3. Main character gets result
4. Main character rolls

### Simultaneous Action
Sometimes everyone acts together:
- All roll at once
- Highest becomes "main"
- Others provide aid if successful
- Represents group coordination

### Extended Assistance
For long tasks:
- Helpers assist throughout
- One check covers whole period
- Failure might mean getting in way
- Success maintains bonus

## Special Situations

### Aiding NPCs
PCs can help NPCs:
- Same mechanics apply
- NPC uses their skill bonus
- Represents teamwork
- Builds relationships

### NPCs Aiding PCs
Skilled NPCs can help:
- Use NPC's skill bonus
- Usually just +1 if competent
- Exceptional NPCs might give +2
- Represents professional assistance

### Group Projects
Everyone contributing:
- Each makes check
- Successes accumulate
- More successes = better result
- Failures create complications

## Mechanical Benefits

### The +1 Bonus
Seems small but significant:
- Increases success by ~15%
- Can make impossible possible
- Represents teamwork advantage
- Encourages cooperation

### Skill Synergies
Encourages creative thinking:
- Players find unexpected connections
- Different skills become useful
- Everyone can contribute
- Promotes role diversity

### Risk Mitigation
Failed help rarely hurts:
- Main character still rolls
- Just don't get bonus
- Unless dramatically appropriate
- Encourages attempting aid

## Roleplaying Assistance

### Describe the Help
Players should explain:
- What they're doing
- How it helps
- Why their skill applies
- What success looks like

### Team Dynamics
Aid represents:
- Characters working together
- Building on strengths
- Covering weaknesses
- Forming bonds

### Narrative Weight
Even mechanical +1 has story:
- Shows character cooperation
- Creates shared success
- Builds group identity
- Memorable moments

## Common Aid Scenarios

### The Heist
- Face distracts guards (Talk aids Sneak)
- Hacker loops cameras (Program aids Sneak)
- Muscle stands ready (Exert aids Talk)
- Expert guides timing (Know aids various)

### The Investigation
- Assistant researches (Know aids Know)
- Local provides contacts (Connect aids Connect)
- Muscle intimidates (Exert aids Talk)
- Tech runs analysis (Program aids Notice)

### The Repair
- Assistant hands tools (Fix aids Fix)
- Expert advises (Know aids Fix)
- Strong holds parts (Exert aids Fix)
- Hacker runs diagnostics (Program aids Fix)

### The Negotiation
- Advisor whispers facts (Know aids Talk)
- Bodyguard looms (Exert aids Talk)
- Assistant documents (Administer aids Talk)
- Local explains customs (Connect aids Talk)

## Limitations and Rulings

### One Chance
Usually can't retry aid:
- First attempt represents best effort
- Circumstances must change
- Different approach might work
- Time often prevents retries

### Appropriate Skills
GM judges what skills work:
- Must make narrative sense
- Player creativity encouraged
- But not everything works
- Keep reasonable limits

### Consequences
Failed aid might:
- Alert enemies (failed Sneak)
- Worsen negotiations (failed Talk)
- Damage equipment (failed Fix)
- Waste resources (failed anything)
