# Basic Mechanics

The fundamental systems that determine success and failure in Stars Without Number. These mechanics form the foundation for all other game systems.

## Core Mechanics

### [Skill Checks](skill-checks.md)
The primary resolution mechanic for uncertain tasks:
- Roll 2d6 + skill + attribute vs difficulty
- When to roll and when not to
- Choosing appropriate skills
- Handling success and failure

### [Saving Throws](saving-throws.md)
Avoiding immediate perils through luck or fortitude:
- Three types: Physical, Evasion, Mental
- Roll 1d20 vs save score (lower is better)
- Natural 1 always fails, 20 always succeeds
- Used for poisons, traps, psychic attacks

### [Opposed Checks](opposed-checks.md)
Contests between characters:
- Both roll, highest wins
- PCs win ties
- Used for stealth, chases, negotiations
- Group contests and extended competitions

### [Aiding Others](aiding-others.md)
Working together to overcome challenges:
- Helper rolls vs same DC
- Success grants +1 to main roll
- Creative skill applications encouraged
- Maximum +1 regardless of helpers

## Design Philosophy

### Fairness Over Drama
- Dice don't favor anyone
- No "plot armor" or fate points
- Success earned, not guaranteed
- Creates genuine tension

### Simplicity and Consistency
- Same basic mechanics throughout
- 2d6 for skills (bell curve)
- 1d20 for saves (flat probability)
- Modifiers typically -2 to +2

### Player Competence
- Characters are skilled professionals
- Don't roll for routine tasks
- Background matters
- Failure means extraordinary circumstances

## Quick Reference

### Skill Check DCs
- **6**: Trivial task
- **8**: Easy challenge  
- **10**: Average difficulty
- **12**: Hard task
- **14+**: Extreme challenge

### Save Progressions
| Level | Base Save |
|-------|-----------|
| 1 | 15 |
| 2 | 14 |
| 3 | 13 |
| 4 | 12 |
| 5 | 11 |
| 10 | 6 |

### Common Modifiers
- **Favorable conditions**: +1 to +2
- **Hostile conditions**: -1 to -2
- **Perfect tools/situation**: +2
- **Improvised/desperate**: -2
- **Aid from another**: +1

## When to Use Each System

### Use Skill Checks For:
- Tasks requiring expertise
- Uncertain outcomes
- Competitive situations
- Extended efforts
- Creative problem solving

### Use Saving Throws For:
- Avoiding instant dangers
- Resisting external effects
- Surviving environmental hazards
- Mental/physical fortitude
- Last-chance avoidance

### Use Opposed Checks For:
- Direct competition
- Stealth vs perception
- Social conflicts
- Races and chases
- Contested resources

## Scenes and Timing

### Scene Duration
Many abilities work per "scene":
- One distinct activity/encounter
- Usually 15 minutes or less
- Combat is one scene
- Infiltration is one scene
- Meeting is one scene

### Time Scales
- **Round**: 6 seconds (combat)
- **Scene**: ~15 minutes
- **Hour**: Exploration
- **Day**: Travel/healing
- **Week**: Downtime

## Dice Conventions

### Reading the Dice
- **2d6**: Two six-sided dice
- **1d20**: One twenty-sided die
- **1d8+1**: One eight-sided die plus 1
- **3d6 drop lowest**: Roll three d6, ignore lowest

### Natural Rolls
- "Natural" means the actual die showing
- Natural 1 or 20 special for saves
- No criticals on skill checks
- Unmodified by bonuses/penalties

## Optional Rules

### Taking the Average
When not under pressure:
- Assume roll of 7 on 2d6
- Add skill and attribute
- If total meets DC, automatic success
- Represents careful, methodical approach

### Group Checks
For large groups:
- Roll once for group
- Use best modifier
- Or average modifier
- Speeds up play

### Degrees of Success
GM may rule:
- Beat DC by 5+: Exceptional success
- Exactly meet DC: Bare success
- Fail by 1-2: Partial success
- Fail by 5+: Catastrophic failure

## Common Pitfalls

### Over-Rolling
- Don't roll for routine tasks
- Don't roll without stakes
- Don't roll if failure is boring
- Trust character competence

### Modifier Inflation
- Keep modifiers small
- ±2 is usually maximum
- Multiple small modifiers don't stack endlessly
- Extreme situations might justify ±3

### Forgetting PC Competence
- PCs are professionals
- Background knowledge is free
- Assume basic competence
- Only roll for exceptional challenges
