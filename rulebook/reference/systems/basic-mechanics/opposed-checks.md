# Opposed Skill Checks

Sometimes a PC wants to accomplish something that another character actively wants to prevent. These situations call for opposed skill checks, where success goes to whoever rolls highest.

## Basic Opposed Check Mechanics

### How It Works
1. All participants roll their relevant skill checks
2. Each rolls 2d6 + skill + attribute modifier
3. Highest total wins
4. **Ties go to the PC** (or aggressor if both are PCs)

### NPC Skill Bonuses
NPCs use their listed skill bonus:
- Add to any check appropriate to their role
- Guards good at noticing, merchants at trading
- No bonus if task outside their expertise
- Unskilled NPCs just roll 2d6

## Common Opposed Situations

### Stealth vs Perception
**Sneaking Past Guards**
- Attacker: Dex/Sneak
- Defender: Wis/Notice
- Conditions affect both sides
- Multiple guards might each get rolls

**Hiding Objects**
- Hider: Int/Sneak or Dex/Sneak  
- Seeker: Wis/Notice or Int/Notice
- Time pressure affects difficulty
- Thorough search gives bonus

### Social Conflicts
**Deception vs Insight**
- Liar: Cha/Talk
- Detector: Wis/Notice or Wis/Talk
- Believable lies easier
- Prior knowledge helps detection

**Persuasion Contests**
- Both use Cha/Talk typically
- Or Talk vs Mental save
- Audience judges winner
- Context matters greatly

### Physical Contests
**Grappling**
- Both use Str/Exert usually
- Or Punch for trained fighters
- Size differences matter
- Position grants advantage

**Races and Chases**
- Foot race: Dex/Exert
- Vehicle: Dex/Pilot
- Endurance: Con/Exert
- Terrain knowledge helps

### Mental Contests
**Hacking Duels**
- Both use Int/Program
- Defender advantage on own system
- Time pressure for attacker
- Security level affects difficulty

**Psychic Battles**
- Psychic skill vs Mental save
- Or psychic skill vs psychic skill
- Effort spending crucial
- Range and contact matter

## Multiple Participants

### Group Contests
When groups oppose each other:
- Leaders roll for groups
- Or everyone rolls, majority wins
- Or highest single roll wins
- GM decides based on situation

### Many vs One
**One person hiding from many**:
- Sneaker rolls once
- Each searcher rolls separately
- Any success spots the hider
- Numbers favor seekers

**One convincing many**:
- Speaker rolls once
- Highest skeptic rolls oppose
- Or average resistance
- Crowd mood affects DC

## Modifiers in Opposed Checks

### Circumstance Modifiers
Apply modifiers to relevant side:
- **Better position**: +1 to +2
- **Superior equipment**: +1 to +2
- **Environmental advantage**: +1
- **Distraction/handicap**: -1 to -2

### Asymmetric Modifiers
Each side might have different modifiers:
- Sneaker in shadows: +2
- Guard in bright area: -1
- Net advantage: +3 to sneaker

### Skill Synergies
Related skills might help:
- Know skill for anticipating behavior
- Connect for social reading
- Fix for understanding security
- Usually +1 if justified

## Extended Contests

### Best of Three
For dramatic contests:
- Roll three opposed checks
- First to win two succeeds
- Allows comeback potential
- Each round might use different skills

### Accumulating Success
For long-term conflicts:
- Each win grants a point
- First to X points wins
- Represents gradual advantage
- Good for infiltrations, negotiations

### Staged Contests
Success unlocks next stage:
1. Sneak past outer guards
2. Hack security system  
3. Steal object
4. Escape pursuit

## Special Considerations

### Passive Opposition
Sometimes defender isn't actively opposing:
- Use static difficulty instead
- Base on defender's skill total
- DC = 8 + skill + attribute
- Represents routine competence

### Impossible Contests
Some contests can't be won:
- Master vs novice
- Overwhelming numbers
- Perfect conditions
- GM may skip roll

### Partial Success
Even losing might achieve something:
- Learn opponent's capabilities
- Buy time for allies
- Force opponent to reveal resources
- Create later opportunity

## Tactical Considerations

### Choosing Your Approach
- Pick your best skill if multiple apply
- Force opponent into weak skill
- Create favorable conditions first
- Sometimes avoiding contest is wisest

### Setting Up Success
Before the contest:
- Gather information
- Prepare equipment
- Choose timing
- Stack advantages

### Accept When Beaten
- Not every contest is winnable
- Retreat preserves resources
- Learn for next time
- Living matters more than winning

## Common Rulings

### Surprise and Initiative
- Ambush uses opposed Sneak vs Notice
- Winner determines surprise
- Affects whether target acts first round
- Not same as combat initiative roll

### Social Combat
- Extended persuasion scenes
- Each exchange is opposed check
- Track "social hit points"
- First to convince audience wins

### Skill Challenge Races
- Not just single roll
- Multiple checks over time
- Different skills each stage
- Complications from failures
