# Vacuum and Decompression

The airless void of space is humanity's most common environmental enemy. Understanding vacuum exposure and decompression can mean the difference between a close call and a funeral.

## Vacuum Exposure

### Immediate Effects
Upon exposure to vacuum:
- **Round 1-2**: Hold breath, act normally
- **Round 3+**: Suffocation begins
- **No instant death**: Movies lie
- **No freezing**: Heat loss is slow
- **No explosion**: Body contains pressure

### Suffocation Rules
After breath runs out:
- Must make Physical save
- DC 8, +1 per round
- Success: Continue acting
- Failure: Fall unconscious
- Death: 4 rounds after unconsciousness

Total survival: ~6-8 rounds typical.

### What Happens to the Body
Realistic effects:
- Saliva boils on tongue
- Skin puffs slightly
- Eyes water heavily
- Eardrums may rupture
- Consciousness fades fast

Not Hollywood dramatics.

## Explosive Decompression

### Sudden Pressure Loss
When atmosphere evacuates:
- **Instant**: Save or be swept away
- **Gradual**: Time to react
- **Violent**: Take 1d6 damage
- **Debris**: Flying hazards
- **Disorientation**: -2 to actions

### Making the Save
Evasion save to:
- Grab something solid
- Avoid being ejected
- Dodge flying debris
- Keep equipment
- Maintain position

Failure means space walk.

### Damage Sources
During decompression:
- Flying objects: 1d6
- Slamming into walls: 1d4
- Pressure change: 1 damage
- Ruptured eardrums: Deafened
- Debris cloud: Blind 1d4 rounds

## Protection

### Vac Suits
Standard protection:
- Complete vacuum immunity
- Hours of air (typically 4-6)
- Temperature regulation
- Radiation shielding (basic)
- Helmet HUD

While suit integrity maintained.

### Sealed Armor
Military-grade protection:
- As vac suit
- More durable
- Combat-ready
- Better life support
- Expensive

### Emergency Gear
Temporary solutions:
- **Pressure mask**: 10 minutes air
- **Emergency bubble**: 30 minutes
- **Suit patches**: Fix small breaches
- **Air tablets**: 5 minutes each
- **Rescue balls**: One person shelter

## Suit Breaches

### Minor Breaches
Small holes:
- Hissing air loss
- 10 minutes to patch
- -1 to all actions
- Gradual pressure loss
- Usually survivable

### Major Breaches
Large tears:
- Rapid air loss
- 1-3 minutes air
- Must patch immediately
- -4 to actions
- Often fatal

### Catastrophic Failure
Suit destroyed:
- Immediate vacuum exposure
- No protection
- Suffocation rules apply
- Pray for rescue
- Usually lethal

### Field Repairs
Patching suits:
- Dex/Fix check
- DC 8 minor breach
- DC 12 major breach
- Patches consumed
- Takes full round

## Common Scenarios

### Hull Breach
Ship compartment opens:
- Evasion save or swept out
- Damage from debris
- Grab something solid
- Seal breach or evacuate
- Every second counts

### EVA Complications
During spacewalk:
- Tether snaps
- Suit malfunction
- Micro-meteorite impact
- Thruster failure
- Drifting away

### Airlock Failure
Trapped between:
- Cycling malfunction
- Manual override needed
- Air running out
- Technical skill check
- Panic management

### Combat Decompression
Used as weapon:
- Blow out windows
- Open exterior doors
- Target suit integrity
- Create chaos
- Tactical advantage

## Zero-G with Vacuum

### Movement Issues
In vacuum and zero-g:
- No air resistance
- Momentum continues
- Need thrust to change
- Easy to overshoot
- Mag boots help

### Combat Problems
Fighting in vacuum:
- Communication difficult
- Limited mobility
- Suit restricts movement
- Weapons considerations
- Breach risk high

## Survival Tactics

### Preparation
Before EVA:
- Check suit thoroughly
- Carry patch kit
- Tether when possible
- Know airlock locations
- Brief emergency procedures

### During Exposure
If exposed:
- Don't hold breath (lungs rupture)
- Exhale immediately
- Stay calm
- Signal for help
- Get to air ASAP

### Emergency Procedures
Standard protocols:
- Buddy system
- Regular check-ins
- Emergency transponders
- Rescue standby
- Clear evacuation routes

## Technological Solutions

### Artificial Gravity
Prevents some issues:
- Keeps feet on deck
- Orients during breach
- Reduces panic
- Aids movement
- Not always available

### Emergency Force Fields
High-tech option:
- Seals breaches instantly
- Temporary solution
- Power intensive
- Not common
- Allows repairs

### Pressure Refuges
Safe zones:
- Emergency shelters
- Reinforced sections
- Independent life support
- Clearly marked
- Capacity limited

## Environmental Details

### Space Isn't Empty
Hazards beyond vacuum:
- Solar radiation
- Micro-meteorites
- Temperature extremes
- Electrical discharge
- Debris fields

### Unique Locations
Special vacuum hazards:
- Inside gas giant: Pressure + toxic
- Near star: Radiation + heat
- Asteroid field: Impact risk
- Nebula: Charged particles
- Wreckage: Sharp debris

## Long-term Exposure

### Body Recovery
After death in vacuum:
- Freeze-drying occurs
- Preservation possible
- Radiation damage
- Micro-impacts
- Eventually unrecognizable

### Psychological Effects
Survivor trauma:
- Claustrophobia in suits
- Panic in airlocks
- Checking seals obsessively
- Nightmares common
- Therapy needed

## Equipment Failure Rates

### Typical Lifespans
Under normal use:
- Vac suit: 5 years
- Seals: 1 year
- Patches: Single use
- Filters: 100 hours
- Batteries: 500 cycles

### Maintenance Critical
Regular care includes:
- Seal inspection
- Pressure tests
- Joint lubrication
- Electronics check
- Emergency drill

## Common Questions

### How long can I really survive?
- Conscious: 10-15 seconds
- Alive: 1-2 minutes
- With training: Slightly longer
- Varies by individual

### Does blood boil?
- No, skin contains it
- Saliva/tears do boil
- Internal pressure maintained
- Death by suffocation

### Can I swim through space?
- No, nothing to push against
- Need reaction mass
- Thruster pack required
- Or throw objects opposite

### Will I instantly freeze?
- No, vacuum insulates
- Slow heat radiation
- Hours to freeze
- Suffocate first
