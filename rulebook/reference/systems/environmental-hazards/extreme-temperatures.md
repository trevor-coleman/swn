- Special suits only
- Death in minutes

### Cold Damage Effects
What happens:
- Numbness/tingling
- Shivering uncontrollable  
- Confusion sets in
- Extremities freeze
- Core temperature drops
- Heart stops

### Frostbite
Localized damage:
- Fingers/toes first
- Ears and nose
- Permanent damage possible
- Amputation risk
- Immediate care needed

## Heat Exposure

### Effects by Temperature
Escalating threat:

**Hot (50°C to 60°C)**
- 1 damage per hour
- Physical save DC 8
- Light clothing best
- Water critical

**Desert (60°C to 80°C)**
- 1d4 damage per 10 minutes
- Physical save DC 10
- Cooling gear needed
- Dehydration rapid

**Extreme Heat (Above 80°C)**
- 1d6 damage per minute
- Physical save DC 12
- Environmental suits only
- Metal burns skin

### Heat Damage Effects
Body's response:
- Profuse sweating
- Dizziness/nausea
- Cramping muscles
- Confusion/delirium
- Organs shut down
- Death from hyperthermia

### Dehydration
Compounding factor:
- Doubles water needs
- Faster in heat
- Reduces saves
- Impairs judgment
- Can kill alone

## Protection

### Cold Weather Gear
Layered approach:
- **Basic clothes**: +2 hours tolerance
- **Winter gear**: Comfortable to -20°C
- **Arctic suit**: Safe to -60°C
- **Heated suit**: Powered warmth
- **Environment suit**: Any temperature

### Hot Weather Protection
Cooling methods:
- **Light clothes**: +2 hours tolerance
- **Desert gear**: Comfortable to 50°C
- **Cooling vest**: Safe to 60°C
- **Coolant suit**: Active cooling
- **Environment suit**: Any temperature

### Improvised Protection
Emergency measures:
- Multiple layers
- Reflective materials
- Wet cloths (cooling)
- Insulation packing
- Shelter priority

## Environmental Factors

### Wind Effects
Multiplies danger:
- **Wind chill**: Effective temp lower
- **Heat dispersion**: Sometimes helps
- **Sand/snow**: Visibility issues
- **Penetration**: Through clothes
- **Shelter critical**: Blocks wind

### Humidity Impact
Changes everything:
- **Dry cold**: More tolerable
- **Wet cold**: Penetrating
- **Dry heat**: Sweat works
- **Humid heat**: Sweat fails
- **Adjust saves**: ±2 DC

### Altitude Modifiers
Height complications:
- Temperature drops
- Oxygen reduced
- UV increased
- Weather severe
- Combined hazards

## Sudden Changes

### Thermal Shock
Rapid transitions:
- Physical save DC 10
- 1d6 damage possible
- Stuns 1d4 rounds
- Equipment stress
- Shelter to shelter

### Environmental Transitions
Common scenarios:
- Airlock to surface
- Day/night extremes
- Altitude changes
- Weather fronts
- System failures

### Equipment Failure
Temperature effects:
- Batteries drain (cold)
- Electronics overheat
- Seals crack
- Lubricants fail
- Materials brittle/soft

## Survival Strategies

### Cold Survival
Key principles:
- **Shelter**: First priority
- **Insulation**: Trap heat
- **Calories**: Fuel body
- **Movement**: Generate heat
- **Layers**: Adjust as needed

### Heat Survival
Critical needs:
- **Shade**: Avoid direct sun
- **Water**: Constant intake
- **Rest**: During peak heat
- **Cooling**: Any method
- **Cover**: Protect skin

### Finding Shelter
Natural options:
- Caves/overhangs
- Snow caves
- Buried structures
- Vehicle hulls
- Natural windbreaks

## Technological Solutions

### Climate Control
Standard tech:
- Building HVAC
- Vehicle systems
- Suit regulation
- Portable units
- Emergency shelters

### Advanced Options
Higher tech:
- Force field bubbles
- Thermal nanites
- Metabolic adjustment
- Cryo/pyro shields
- Weather control

### Power Requirements
Heating/cooling needs:
- Constant drain
- Battery limits
- Backup essential
- Failures deadly
- Monitor always

## Special Environments

### Vacuum Temperature
Space considerations:
- No air conduction
- Radiation only
- Slow changes
- Sun/shade extreme
- Suits handle both

### Liquid Environments
Under water/chemicals:
- Conducts heat fast
- Hypothermia quick
- Special suits
- Pressure adds complexity
- Chemical burns

### Mixed Hazards
Common combinations:
- Arctic + radiation
- Desert + toxic air
- Volcanic + gravity
- Storm + vacuum
- Multiple saves

## Long-term Exposure

### Adaptation
Body adjusts slowly:
- Weeks to months
- Partial resistance
- Never immune
- Comfort range shifts
- Still need protection

### Permanent Residents
Living in extremes:
- Underground cities
- Domed habitats
- Adapted clothing
- Cultural changes
- Emergency ready

### Psychological Effects
Mental strain:
- Cabin fever
- Seasonal depression
- Constant vigilance
- Resource anxiety
- Social tensions

## Common Questions

### How fast do I freeze/cook?
- Depends on temperature
- Protection extends time
- Varies by conditions
- Rules approximate reality

### Does armor help?
- Regular armor: No
- Sealed suits: Yes
- Powered armor: Yes
- Insulation possible

### What about aliens?
