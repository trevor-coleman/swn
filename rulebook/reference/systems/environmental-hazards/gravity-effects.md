## Zero-G Movement

### Basic Principles
Newton's laws rule:
- Push off surfaces
- Momentum continues
- No air resistance
- Rotation separate
- Every action = reaction

### Movement Methods
Getting around:
- **Push/Pull**: Use handholds

- **Thrusters**: Precise control
- **Throwing**: Reaction movement
- **Tethers**: Safety lines

### Common Problems
Inexperienced issues:
- Over-pushing
- Can't stop
- Wrong angle
- Spinning helplessly
- Collision damage

### Zero-G Skill
Dex/Exert checks for:
- Complex maneuvers
- Emergency stops
- Combat movement
- Precise positioning
- Catching objects

## High-G Effects

### Physical Strain
Constant pressure:
- **1.5g**: Noticeable weight
- **2g**: Movement difficult
- **3g**: Standing hard
- **4g**: Crawling only
- **5g+**: Immobilized

### Mechanical Effects
Game modifiers:

**1.3-1.7g**:
- -10m throwing range
- +1 fall damage die
- Encumbrance tighter

**1.8-2.5g**:
- Half movement
- -2 physical actions
- Double encumbrance
- 1 strain per hour

**2.6g+**:
- Quarter movement
- -4 physical actions
- System strain constant
- Special equipment needed

### Long-term Exposure
Extended high-g:
- Bone density increases
- Muscle mass grows
- Heart enlarges
- Blood pressure issues
- Height decreases

## Low-G Effects

### Movement Changes
Bouncing world:
- Jumps go higher
- Running faster
- Stopping harder
- Direction changes difficult
- Wall-running possible

### Combat Modifications
Fighting differences:
- Recoil matters more
- Melee timing off
- Cover hopping
- Aerial time
- Landing critical

### Long-term Effects
Extended low-g:
- Bone loss
- Muscle atrophy
- Heart weakening
- Balance issues
- Calcium depletion

## Equipment in Variable Gravity

### Standard Gear
How items behave:
- **Projectiles**: Arcs change
- **Liquids**: Pour differently
- **Electronics**: Usually fine
- **Mechanical**: May jam
- **Explosives**: Debris patterns

### Specialized Equipment
Gravity-adapted:
- **Weighted suits**: For low-g
- **Exoskeletons**: For high-g
- **Mag boots**: For zero-g
- **Grip gloves**: Any gravity
- **Tethers**: Safety first

### Weapon Considerations
Combat changes:
- **Guns**: Recoil management
- **Grenades**: Trajectory
- **Melee**: Timing/force
- **Thrown**: Distance varies
- **Energy**: Unaffected

## Environmental Combinations

### Zero-G + Vacuum

- Opposite problems
- Can't visit other worlds
- Cultural isolation
- Physical differences

## Medical Considerations

### G-Force Injuries
Sudden changes cause:
- Blackouts (high-g)
- Disorientation
- Organ stress
- Blood pooling
- Bone fractures

### Pressure Suits
High-g assistance:
- Compression zones
- Blood flow help
- Breathing support
- Cooling systems
- Power required

### Emergency Treatment
