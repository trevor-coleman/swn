# Environmental Hazards

Space is hostile to human life. From the vacuum between stars to alien atmospheres, environmental hazards present constant threats to explorers.

## Section Overview

- **[Vacuum and Decompression](vacuum-decompression.md)** - The void's deadly embrace
- **[Radiation](radiation.md)** - Invisible killer of space
- **[Extreme Temperatures](extreme-temperatures.md)** - Freezing cold and searing heat
- **[Toxic Atmospheres](toxic-atmospheres.md)** - Alien airs and poisonous gases
- **[Gravity Effects](gravity-effects.md)** - From crushing weight to weightlessness
- **[Other Hazards](other-hazards.md)** - Falls, drowning, and more

## Core Mechanics

### Hazard Saves
Most environmental hazards require:
- **Physical save**: Against bodily harm
- **Evasion save**: To avoid danger zones
- **Mental save**: Rarely, for psychological effects

Frequency varies by hazard severity.

### Damage Types
Environmental damage typically:
- Bypasses armor (unless sealed)
- Occurs at intervals
- Accumulates quickly
- Requires special protection
- Can be prevented

### Protection Levels
- **None**: Full exposure
- **Partial**: Reduces frequency/damage
- **Full**: Complete immunity
- **Temporary**: Limited duration
- **Failing**: Degrading protection

## Quick Reference

### Common Save DCs
- **Mild hazard**: DC 8
- **Moderate hazard**: DC 10
- **Severe hazard**: DC 12
- **Extreme hazard**: DC 14
- **Lethal hazard**: DC 16+

### Typical Damage
- **Gradual**: 1 damage per hour
- **Dangerous**: 1d4 per 10 minutes
- **Severe**: 1d6 per minute
- **Extreme**: 1d8 per round
- **Instant death**: No save

### Protection Types
- **Vac suit**: Vacuum, temperature
- **Filter mask**: Basic toxins
- **Sealed armor**: Most hazards
- **Environment suit**: Specific worlds
- **Shelter**: Varies by type

## Combining Hazards

Multiple simultaneous hazards:
- Save against each
- Damage accumulates
- Protection may not cover all
- Prioritize greatest threat
- Escape becomes critical

Example: Toxic, high-gravity world requires saves vs both, special equipment.
