# Radiation

The invisible killer of space, radiation comes in many forms - from solar winds to reactor leaks, from cosmic rays to nuclear weapons. Protection and detection are essential for survival.

## Types of Radiation

### Solar Radiation
From active stars:
- Constant in space
- Varies by distance
- Solar flares spike levels
- Atmospheres protect
- Magnetic fields help

### Cosmic Radiation

- Low but cumulative
- Worse in deep space
- Shielding helps
- Long-term risk

### Artificial Sources
Human-made radiation:
- Reactor leaks
- Nuclear weapons
- Medical equipment
- Industrial processes

- Geological activity
- Contaminated zones

## Radiation Exposure

### Exposure Levels
Measured in severity:
- **Low**: 1 damage per day
- **Moderate**: 1 damage per hour
- **High**: 1d4 damage per 10 minutes
- **Severe**: 1d6 damage per minute
- **Extreme**: 1d8 damage per round

### Making Saves
Physical saves against radiation:
- **Low**: DC 8 per day
- **Moderate**: DC 10 per hour
- **High**: DC 12 per exposure
- **Severe**: DC 14 per minute
- **Extreme**: DC 16 per round

Success halves damage.

### Cumulative Effects
Radiation accumulates:
- No immediate symptoms
- Gradual sickness
- System strain possible
- Long-term consequences
- Eventually fatal

## Protection

### Basic Shielding
Standard protection:

### Contaminated Areas
Long-term hazards:
- Fallout zones
- Waste dumps
- Battle sites
- Accident areas
- Natural deposits

### Clean Zones
Safe areas:
- Deep underground
- Shielded bunkers
- Medical bays
- Clean rooms
- Decontamination

## Symptoms and Effects

### Acute Exposure
Immediate symptoms:
- Nausea/vomiting
- Skin burns
- Hair loss
- Weakness
- Organ failure

High doses kill quickly.

### Chronic Exposure
Long-term effects:
- Cancer risk
- Genetic damage
- Sterility
- Immune weakness
- Shortened lifespan

Lower doses over time.

### System Strain
Radiation may cause:
- 1-3 strain per exposure
- Cumulative effect
- Permanent damage
- Treatment helps
- Prevention better

## Decontamination

### Personal Decon
Removing contamination:
- Strip contaminated gear
- Shower thoroughly
- Medical scanning
- Dispose materials
- Monitor health

### Area Decon
Cleaning spaces:
- Identify hot spots
- Remove materials
- Scrub surfaces
- Seal waste
- Verify clean

### Equipment Decon
Saving gear:
- External washing
- Component replacement
- Electronic cleaning
- Disposal if severe
- Cost vs replace

## Special Circumstances

### Alien Radiation
Unknown types:
- Different wavelengths
- Strange effects
- Detection difficult
- Protection uncertain
- Research needed

### Psionic Radiation
Mental energy:
- Psychic "fallout"
- Mind shields help
