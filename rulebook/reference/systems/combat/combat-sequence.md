# Combat Sequence

Combat in Stars Without Number is divided into rounds, with each participant acting in turn. The sequence ensures orderly resolution of a chaotic situation.

## Rounds and Time

### Combat Round
- **Duration**: 6 seconds
- **Actions**: Everyone acts once
- **Sequence**: High initiative to low
- **Repeat**: Until combat ends

### Scene Time
- Combat is measured in rounds
- Most combats last 3-10 rounds
- Entire fight is one "scene"
- Powers/abilities often last per scene

## Initiative

### Rolling Initiative
1. Each participant rolls 1d8
2. Add Dexterity modifier
3. NPCs usually have no modifier
4. Act in order, high to low
5. **PCs win ties**

### Initiative Order
- Rolled once at combat start
- **Not re-rolled** each round
- Same order throughout fight
- Write down for reference

### Group Initiative (Optional)
Simpler but swingier system:
1. Best PC Dexterity rolls for party
2. GM rolls once for all enemies
3. Winning side acts first
4. Members act in any order
5. Then other side acts

## Surprise and Ambush

### Determining Surprise
Most ambushes involve:
- **Attacker**: Dex/Sneak roll
- **Defender**: Wis/Notice check
- **Defender wins ties**
- Failure = surprised

### Inevitable Surprise

- Trusted ally betrays
- Perfectly hidden sniper
- No reasonable warning
