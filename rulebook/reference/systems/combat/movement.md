# Movement and Positioning

Tactical movement and positioning often determine victory in combat. Understanding how to move safely and control the battlefield is crucial for survival.

## Basic Movement

### Standard Move
**Move Action** - 10 meters
- Accounts for dodging
- Includes minor obstacles
- Watching for threats
- Can't be split up

### Running 
**Main + Move Actions** - 20 meters
- Straight line only
- -2 AC penalty
- No attacks possible
- Full sprint speed

### Difficult Terrain
**Half normal speed**:
- Climbing surfaces
- Swimming
- Dense rubble
- Steep slopes
- Deep snow/sand

May require skill checks.

## Combat Movement Rules

### No Split Movement
- Use entire Move at once
- Can't move-attack-move
- Finish movement before acting
- Plan your positioning

### Diagonal Movement
- Count as 1 meter
- Or use 1.5m if strict
- Usually simplified
- Grid optional

### Vertical Movement
- Climbing: Half speed
- Jumping: Limited distance
- Flying: If capable
- Falling: Instant (dangerous)

## Engaging in Melee

### Melee Range
- Adjacent squares
- About 2 meters
- Within weapon reach
- Close enough to threaten

### Entering Melee
- Move adjacent
- Now "engaged"
- Can attack
- Threatens enemy

### Leaving Melee
Two options:

**Fighting Withdrawal** (safe):
- Main Action
- No free attacks
- Can move away
- Time consuming

**Just Move** (dangerous):
- Move Action only
- Triggers free attack
- From each melee enemy
- Risky but fast

### Free Attacks
When triggered:
- Automatic hit
- Normal damage
- No attack roll
- Happens instantly

## Special Movement

### Charge
Rushing to combat:
- Must move 4+ meters
- Straight line
- +2 to hit
- -2 AC until next turn
- Move + Attack

### Prone Movement
Crawling along:
- Half speed (5m)
- Better vs ranged
- Worse vs melee
- Standing takes Main

### Forced Movement
Being pushed/pulled:
- Hit with Punch attack
- Opposed Str check
- 3 meters if lose
- Into hazards possible

## Positioning Tactics

### Using Cover
Types of cover:
- **Half**: -2 to hit you
- **Full**: -4 to hit you
- **Total**: Can't be targeted
- Must expose to attack

Finding cover:
- Corners ideal
- Furniture works
- Vehicles excellent
- Natural terrain

### High Ground
Advantages:
- Better sight lines
- Harder to reach
- Cover options
- Psychological edge

### Chokepoints
Controlling access:
- Doorways
- Narrow passages
- Bridges
- Stairs

Benefits:
- Limit enemy numbers
- Focus fire
- Predictable approach
- Easier defense

### Flanking
No formal bonuses but:
- Narrative advantage
- Prevents escape
- Psychological pressure
- Coordinated attacks

## Movement in Difficult Conditions

### Environmental Hazards
- **Vacuum**: Normal until you die
- **Low gravity**: Maybe farther
- **High gravity**: Probably slower
- **Underwater**: Half speed, special rules

### Visibility Issues
- **Darkness**: No movement penalty
- **Smoke**: Might slow
- **Crowds**: Definitely slow
- **Obstacles**: Navigate carefully

### Unstable Surfaces
- Ice: Risk of falling
- Narrow: Careful movement
- Moving: Relative speeds
- Collapsing: Get off fast

## Tactical Movement

### Bounding Overwatch
Team movement:
1. Half move to cover
2. Half provide cover fire
3. Swap roles
4. Repeat advance

### Tactical Withdrawal
Organized retreat:
1. Rear guard fires
2. Others fall back
3. Establish new line
4. Rear guard moves
5. Repeat as needed

### Room Clearing
Entering dangerous spaces:
1. Stack at entry
2. Peek/scan
3. Rush positions
4. Cover sectors
5. Secure room

## Movement and Actions

### What You Can Do While Moving
**Before/After Move**:
- Main Action
- On Turn actions
- Ready weapons
- Communicate

**Cannot Do**:
- Split movement
- Complex activities
- Careful aim
- Most skills

### Coordinated Movement
With allies:
- Move together
- Cover angles
- Watch spacing
- Maintain formation

## Common Movement Scenarios

### The Chase
- Compare speeds
- Terrain matters
- Obstacles help/hinder
- Endurance counts
- Skills may apply

### The Ambush
- Positioning crucial
- Surprise matters
- Escape routes
- Cover essential
- Initiative key

### The Retreat
- Orderly vs rout
- Cover withdrawal
- Rally points
- Don't get separated

- Injuries
- Terrain
- Conditions
- Exhaustion

## Vehicles and Mounts

### Different Scales
- Personal: Normal rules
- Vehicle: Different system
- Mixed: GM adjudicates
- Relative speeds matter

### Mounted Movement
- Faster than on foot
- Different terrain limits
- Mounting/dismounting
- Control issues

## Zero-G Movement

### Special Considerations
- No "down"
- Momentum continues
- Need handholds
- Different tactics
- Mag boots help

### Combat Changes
- Cover works differently
- No falling
- 3D positioning
- Reaction mass needed

## Common Questions

### Can I move through allies?
- Yes, freely
- Represents coordination

### Can I move through enemies?
- No, they block
- Unless helpless
- Or huge size difference

### How far can I jump?
