# Morale in Combat

Not every enemy fights to the death. Morale rules determine when NPCs flee, surrender, or otherwise abandon the fight.

## Basic Morale Mechanics

### Morale Scores
NPCs have morale ratings:
- **Morale 6**: Cowardly (civilians, pressed gangs)
- **Morale 8**: Average (typical guards, soldiers)
- **Morale 10**: Brave (elite troops, fanatics)
- **Morale 12**: Fearless (robots, zealots, cornered)

### Making Morale Checks
Roll 2d6:
- **â‰¤ Morale score**: Keep fighting
- **> Morale score**: Break and run
- Natural 2: Always stand
- Natural 12: Always flee

### PC Morale
**Players never check morale**
- PCs decide when to flee
- Heroes make own choices
- Player agency preserved
- NPCs follow rules

## When to Check Morale

### Standard Triggers
NPCs check morale when:
1. **First casualty** - Ally drops
2. **Half losses** - 50% down
3. **Leader falls** - Commander killed
4. **Hopeless odds** - Clearly outmatched
5. **Catastrophe** - Explosion, ambush

### Optional Triggers
GM may also require checks for:
- Facing unknown horrors
- Powerful psychic effects  
- Overwhelming firepower
- Betrayal or trap
- Environmental dangers

### Multiple Checks
- Each trigger separate
- Failed check ends it
- Success means fight on
- Until next trigger

## Morale Modifiers

### Positive Modifiers
**+1 to +2 to morale**:
- Strong leader present
- Defending home
- Cornered/no escape
- Religious fervor
- Recent victory

### Negative Modifiers
**-1 to -2 to morale**:
- Leader dead/fled
- Surprised/ambushed
- Facing horror
- Already wounded
- Outnumbered badly

### Conditional Modifiers
- **In cover**: +1
- **In open**: -1
- **Night fighting**: -1 if untrained
- **Has support**: +1

## Morale Break Results

### Flee
Most common result:
- Run from battle
- Drop heavy gear
- Seek safety
- May rally later
- Panic spreads

### Fighting Withdrawal
Orderly retreat:
- Back away shooting
- Maintain formation
- Covering fire
- Organized escape
- May regroup

### Surrender
When escape impossible:
- Drop weapons
- Hands up
- Plead for mercy
- Become prisoners
- Information source

### Rout
Complete panic:
- Every person for self
- Abandon everything
- Trampling risk
- No coordination
- Contagious fear

### Go Down Fighting
When cornered:
- No surrender
- Fight to death
- Desperate attacks
- Take some with them
- Morale 12 effective

## Special Cases

### Mindless Enemies

- Robots
- Zombies  
- Mind-controlled
- Automated systems
- Some aliens

### Fanatics
Modified morale:
- Base 10-12
- Ignore first check
- Fight to last
- No surrender
- Death before dishonor

### Mercenaries
Practical morale:
- Check more often
- Money motivates
- Quick to flee
- May switch sides
- Survival priority

### Animals
Instinct-based:
- Predators flee when hurt
- Prey flees immediately
- Territorial stands ground
- Pack animals vary
- Cornered always fights

## Rally Attempts

### Requirements
To rally fled troops:
- Leader survives
- Safe distance
- Time to regroup
- Communication possible
- Reason to return

### Rally Check
Leader rolls:
- Cha/Lead check
- DC 8 + casualties
- Success regroups
- Failure keeps running
- One attempt only

### Partial Rally
May recover:
- Some troops only
- At reduced morale
- Defensive only
- Or just escape

## Using Morale Tactically

### Breaking Enemy Morale
Focus on:
- Eliminating leaders
- Shock and awe
- Rapid casualties
- Psychological warfare
- Cut off escape

### Maintaining Friendly Morale
As PCs:
- Protect NPC allies
- Show confidence
- Quick victories
- Good positioning
- Clear commands

### Morale as Tool
Not just combat:
- Intimidation factor
- Negotiation leverage
- Strategic planning
- Force multiplier
- Story driver

## Group Morale

### Unit Cohesion
Groups may:
- Share morale score
- Check together
- Break together
- Or fragment

### Chain Reactions
One fleeing may:
- Trigger others
- Spread panic
- Collapse lines
- Cause rout
- End battles

### Mixed Forces
Different morale:
- Elites stand
- Regulars waver
- Conscripts flee
- Check separately
- Affects others

## Morale in Mass Combat

### Simplified System
For large battles:
- Units not individuals
- Single morale score
- Key moments only
- Narrative focus

### Battle Turning Points
Major morale checks:
- Commander falls
- Line breaks
- Flanked/surrounded
- Reinforcements arrive
- Massive casualties
