# Attack and Defense

The core of combat revolves around attack rolls to hit opponents and the various defenses that prevent or mitigate damage.

## Making an Attack

### Attack Roll Formula
To attack a target:
1. Roll 1d20
2. Add base attack bonus
3. Add applicable skill
4. Add attribute modifier
5. Compare to target's AC

**Total ≥ AC = Hit**

### Base Attack Bonus
Depends on class and level:
- **Warriors**: Level +1
- **Partial Warriors**: Level +1  
- **Others**: Half level (round down)
- **NPCs**: Listed in stats

### Applicable Skills
By weapon type:
- **Punch**: Unarmed attacks
- **Stab**: Melee weapons
- **Shoot**: Ranged weapons
- **Special**: Vehicle weapons (Pilot)

**No skill**: -2 penalty if lacking even level-0

### Attribute Modifiers
Depends on weapon:
- **Ranged**: Usually Dexterity
- **Small melee**: Strength or Dexterity
- **Large melee**: Strength only
- **Special**: As listed

Use best if multiple listed.

## Dealing Damage

### Damage Roll
On successful hit:
- Roll weapon's damage die
- Add attribute modifier
- Apply total to target's HP

**Exception**: Punch attacks add skill level to damage

### Example Damage
- Laser pistol (1d6) with Dex +1 = 1d6+1
- Monoblade (1d8+1) with Str +2 = 1d8+3
- Punch with Punch-2 and Str +1 = 1d4+3

## Shock Damage

### How Shock Works
Some melee weapons inflict guaranteed damage:
- Applied on **any** attack (hit or miss)
- Only if target's AC ≤ Shock threshold
- Represents grazing hits, fatigue, fear

### Shock Calculation
- Base Shock value (by weapon)
- Add attribute modifier
- Add other bonuses (foci, mods)
- Apply if AC qualifies

### Shock Examples
**Monoblade**: Shock 2/AC 13
- Always does 2 + modifiers
- Only vs AC 13 or less
- Whether you hit or miss

### Important Shock Rules
- Successful hits never do less than Shock
- Some armor immune to primitive Shock
- Advanced weapons may treat armor as AC 10

## Armor Class

### Calculating AC
**Base AC**: 10
Plus:
- Armor bonus
- Dexterity modifier  
- Shield bonus (if any)
- Other modifiers

### Armor Types
| Armor | AC | Examples |
|-------|-----|----------|
| None | 10 | Street clothes |
| Light | 11-13 | Armored undersuit |
| Medium | 14-16 | Combat field uniform |
| Heavy | 17-18 | Assault suit |
| Powered | 18+ | Powered armor |

### AC Modifiers
**Bonuses**:
- Shield: +1 to +2
- Cover: +2 to +4
- Total Defense: +2
- Prone vs ranged: +2

**Penalties**:
- Running: -2
- Charging: -2
- Climbing: Varies
- Surprised: Easier to hit

## Hit Roll Modifiers

| Target prone (melee) | +2 |
