# Stabilization

When allies fall in combat, quick medical intervention can mean the difference between death and survival. Stabilization rules cover emergency battlefield medicine.

## The Dying Process

### Six Round Timer
From 0 HP, victim has:
- **Round 1**: Just dropped
- **Round 2-3**: Still saveable  
- **Round 4-5**: Getting critical
- **Round 6**: Final chance
- **Round 7**: Death

Each round increases difficulty.

### During These Rounds
The dying character:
- Cannot act usefully
- May be conscious
- Probably in agony
- Definitely helpless
- Needs immediate aid

## Stabilization Attempts

### Basic Requirements
To attempt stabilization:
- Use Main Action
- Be adjacent to victim
- Have free hand(s)
- Make skill check
- Can retry if failed

### The Skill Check
Roll Int/Heal or Dex/Heal:
- Use better modifier
- Add skill bonus
- Compare to DC
- Success = stabilized
- Failure = try again

### Difficulty by Supplies

**No Medical Supplies**
- DC = 10 + rounds elapsed
- Using improvised materials
- Battlefield conditions
- Desperate measures

**Medical Kit Available**
- DC = 8 + rounds elapsed  
- Proper trauma tools
- Sterile supplies
- Diagnostic aids
- Professional equipment

**Lazarus Patch Used**
- DC = 6 + rounds elapsed
- Advanced nanotech
- Automated assistance
- Ideal conditions
- Patch consumed on use

### Automatic Success
**Psychic Succor** (Biopsionics):
- No roll needed
- Always stabilizes
- If time remains
- Costs psi effort

## Stabilization Results

### Successful Stabilization
Victim is:
- No longer dying
- Still at 0 HP
- Extremely fragile
- Conscious in 10 minutes
- At 1 HP when conscious

### The Fragile State
Stabilized characters:
- Can move if desperate
- Function "normally"
- Any damage kills
- No stabilization possible
- Need immediate evac

This fragility lasts until:
- Healed by stims/powers
- Week of medical rest
- Other advanced healing

### Failed Attempts
If check fails:
- Can retry next round
- If victim still alive
- Difficulty increases
- Time running out
- Multiple healers can try

## Tactical Stabilization

### Combat Triage
Priorities in battle:
1. Secure immediate area
2. Assess time remaining
3. Use best healer
4. Have supplies ready
5. Evacuate if possible

### Multiple Casualties
With several dying:
- Prioritize by time
- Use all healers
- Share medical supplies
- Accept some losses
- Focus on saveable

### Under Fire
Stabilizing in combat:
- Provides target
- May need cover
- Others defend healer
- Quick and dirty
- Evac immediately

## Medical Supplies

### Improvised Materials
When desperate:
- Torn clothing
- Belts for tourniquets  
- Dirt to pack wounds
- Pressure and prayer
- DC 10 + rounds

### Medical Kits
Standard contents:
- Bandages/gauze
- Antiseptics
- Surgical tools
- Painkillers
- Diagnostic scanner

Not consumed on use.

### Lazarus Patches
High-tech healing:
- Single use item
- Automated trauma care
- Nanotech repair
- Worth the cost
- Always consumed

Even on failed check.

## Special Circumstances

### Multiple Healers
Several attempting aid:
- Each rolls separately
- Best result counts
- Can't "aid another"
- Time is critical
- Crowding issues

### Non-Human Physiology
Alien casualties:
- May need special knowledge
- -2 to -4 penalty
- Different vital signs
- Unfamiliar anatomy
- GM discretion

### Environmental Hazards
Complicating factors:

- Radiation zones
- Zero gravity
- Active combat

May increase DC or prevent attempts.

## After Stabilization

## Common Scenarios

## Common Questions

### Can I stabilize myself?
- No, you're incapacitated
- Need outside help
- Even if conscious
- Too badly hurt

### Do I need medical training?
- No, anyone can try
- Skill helps significantly
- -2 without any ranks
- Desperation works sometimes

### What about robots?
- Use Fix skill instead
- Same DC structure
- Different supplies
- Repair vs healing
- Similar urgency

### Can I pre-stabilize?
- No, only after 0 HP
- Can't prevent dying
- Only stop it
- React, don't prevent
