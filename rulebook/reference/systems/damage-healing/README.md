# Damage and Healing

The brutal realities of combat and injury in the far future, where death comes quickly but medical technology offers miraculous recoveries.

## Section Overview

- **[Injury and Death](injury-death.md)** - What happens at zero hit points
- **[Stabilization](stabilization.md)** - Saving the mortally wounded
- **[Natural Healing](natural-healing.md)** - Rest and recovery
- **[Medical Treatment](medical-treatment.md)** - Using technology and skill
- **[System Strain](system-strain.md)** - The body's limits

## Core Concepts

### Hit Points
- Abstract resilience, not just physical damage
- Most HP loss represents fatigue, minor injuries, close calls
- Only last few HP are serious wounds
- Zero HP means defeated, not necessarily dead

### Lethality
- **Lethal damage**: Weapons, falls, fire - can kill
- **Non-lethal damage**: Fists, clubs (if intended) - KO only
- Choice made before rolling damage
- Defeated foes' fate depends on victor's intent

### Recovery Rates
- **Stabilized**: 1 HP after 10 minutes, fragile
- **Natural**: Character level in HP per night's rest
- **Medical**: Varies by tech level and treatment
- **Instant**: Stims, biopsionics, lazarus patches

## Quick Reference

### At Zero HP
1. **Lethal damage** → Mortally wounded (dying in 6 rounds)
2. **Non-lethal** → Unconscious (wake with 1 HP in 10 min)
3. **Heavy weapons** → Possibly instant death (GM discretion)

### Stabilization DCs
- **No supplies**: DC 10 + rounds elapsed
- **Medical kit**: DC 8 + rounds elapsed  
- **Lazarus patch**: DC 6 + rounds elapsed
- **Biopsionics**: Automatic success

### Recovery Times
- **Fragile state**: Until healed or 1 week rest
- **TL4 medical**: 1 week recovery
- **TL3 medical**: 1 month recovery
- **TL2 or less**: 1 month + Physical save
