# Natural Healing

The human body's remarkable ability to heal itself remains constant even in the far future. Natural healing is slow but reliable, requiring only rest and time.

## Basic Healing Rate

### Standard Recovery
Characters regain HP through rest:
- **Amount**: Character level per day
- **Requirement**: Full night's rest
- **Quality**: Decent conditions
- **Maximum**: Can't exceed max HP

A level 3 character heals 3 HP per night.

### What Counts as Rest
Adequate rest requires:
- 6-8 hours sleep
- Safe environment
- Basic comfort
- No interruptions
- Minimal stress

### Partial Rest
Insufficient rest heals less:
- Interrupted sleep: Half rate
- Poor conditions: Half rate  
- No rest: No healing
- Light activity: Full rate
- Combat/crisis: No healing

## The Fragility Period

### Critical Recovery
After stabilization from 0 HP:
- First 10 minutes: Gain 1 HP
- Remain **fragile**
- Any damage = instant death
- No further stabilization
- Must avoid all harm

### Removing Fragility
Three ways to end fragile state:

**Advanced Healing**
- Stims provide instant HP
- Biopsionic powers
- Removes fragility immediately
- Can return to action
- Risky but fast

**Medical Rest**
- One week bed rest
- Proper medical care
- No strenuous activity
- Ends fragility
- Then normal healing

**Natural Recovery**
- Without medical care
- Takes much longer
- Higher risk
- See medical treatment

## Environmental Factors

### Ideal Conditions
Accelerate healing:
- Medical facility
- Clean environment
- Proper nutrition
- Low gravity
- Psychological comfort

(No mechanical bonus, but GM may allow)

### Poor Conditions
Slow or prevent healing:
- Extreme temperatures
- High radiation
- Poor air quality
- Constant danger
- Malnutrition

May reduce or eliminate healing.

### Active Conditions
No natural healing during:
- Combat operations
- Forced marches
- Environmental exposure
- System strain
- Severe stress

## Tech Level Impact

### TL4 Medical Support
Modern facilities provide:
- One week recovery from fragile
- Monitoring equipment
- Automated care
- Pharmaceutical support
- Ideal conditions

### TL3 Medical Support  
Industrial age care:
- One month recovery time
- Basic antibiotics
- Surgical capability
- Trained doctors
- Adequate results

### TL2 or Lower
Primitive medicine:
- One month recovery minimum
- Physical save required
- Success: 1d4 more weeks
- Failure: Death from complications
- +Heal skill of caretaker to save

### No Medical Support
Surviving without help:
- Fragile state permanent
- Until advanced healing
- Or natural recovery
- Extremely dangerous
- Avoid at all costs

## Healing Completely

### Timeline Example
Level 4 character, 20 max HP, reduced to 0:
1. Stabilized at 0 HP
2. After 10 min: 1 HP, fragile
3. One week rest: No longer fragile
4. Day 8: 5 HP (1+4)
5. Day 9: 9 HP
6. Day 10: 13 HP
7. Day 11: 17 HP
8. Day 12: 20 HP (full)

Total: 12 days to full recovery

### Speeding Recovery
Natural healing is slow, alternatives:
- Medical stims
- Biopsionic healing
- Lazarus patches
- Pretech medicine
- Tank healing (rare)

## Special Circumstances

### Multiple Injuries
Healing from various sources:
- All heal simultaneously
- Use highest rate
- Don't stack same type
- Natural + medical okay
- Track separately

### Lingering Injuries
Optional rule for gritty games:
- Scars from near-death
- Reduced maximum HP
- Permanent penalties
- Cybernetic replacement
- Psychological trauma

Not standard rules.

### Disease and Poison
May prevent healing:
- Active toxins
- Serious illness
- Parasites
- Radiation sickness
- System strain

Cure condition first.

## Psychological Recovery

### Mental HP Loss
From psychic attacks or trauma:
- Heals same rate
- Needs mental rest
- Therapy helps
- Medication possible
- Time still required

### Morale and Healing
High morale helps:
- Comfortable quarters
- Good food
- Entertainment
- Companionship
- Hope for future

Low morale may slow healing (GM discretion).

## Nutritional Needs

### Food and Water
Required for healing:
- Standard rations fine
- Starvation prevents
- Dehydration critical
- Quality helps morale
- Quantity matters more

### Special Dietary Needs
Some characters require:
- High protein (heavy worlders)
- Special minerals (aliens)
- Filtered water (weak immune)
- Synthesized nutrients
- Cultural preferences

## Common Healing Scenarios

### Shipboard Recovery
Typical spacer healing:
- Small med bay
- Basic supplies
- Crew rotation
- Limited privacy
- Adequate results

### Wilderness Survival
Healing while lost:
- Find shelter first
- Secure water/food
- Avoid predators
- Improvise comfort
- Slow process

### Urban Downtime
City recovery:
- Rent safe room
- Buy medical care
- Avoid enemies
- Lay low
- Faster healing

### Combat Zone
Behind the lines:
- Field hospitals
- Triage priority
- Evacuation likely
- Basic care only
- Get out fast

## Healing Without Medicine

### Traditional Methods
Still used on many worlds:
- Herbal remedies
- Bed rest
- Clean wounds
- Proper diet
- Avoid infection

Counts as TL2 care usually.

### Mental Disciplines
Some claim to accelerate:
- Meditation
- Visualization  
- Biofeedback
- Positive thinking
- Religious faith

No mechanical benefit without psionics.

## When Healing Fails

### Complications
At low tech levels:
- Infection sets in
- Wounds reopen
- Internal damage
- Organ failure
- Slow death

Hence the Physical save.

### Permanent Damage
Some injuries don't fully heal:
- Lost limbs
- Organ damage
- Neural trauma
- Severe burns
- Genetic damage

Require advanced intervention.

## Common Questions

### Do I heal during travel?
- Yes if resting
- Ship bunks count
- Cold sleep doesn't
- Active duty doesn't

### What about first aid?
- Doesn't restore HP
- Only stops dying
