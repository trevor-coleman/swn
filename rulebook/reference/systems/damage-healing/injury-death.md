# Injury and Death

Death comes swiftly in the hostile reaches of space. Understanding the mechanics of injury and dying is crucial for both causing and preventing fatalities.

## Reaching Zero Hit Points

### Defeated in Combat
When reduced to 0 HP, a creature is **defeated** and can no longer fight. What happens next depends on the type of damage:

**Lethal Damage** (most weapons):
- Mortally wounded
- Dying but not dead
- 6 rounds to live
- Needs immediate aid

**Non-lethal Damage** (intended):
- Unconscious/incapacitated
- Not dying
- Recovers 1 HP in 10 minutes
- Functions normally after

**Heavy Weapon Damage**:
- May be instant death
- GM discretion
- Based on dramatic injury
- No stabilization possible

### Choosing Non-Lethal
Before rolling damage, attacker can declare non-lethal intent with:
- Fists
- Clubs
- Blunt weapons
- Mental strain
- Stunning weapons

Target is defeated but will recover.

## The Mortally Wounded

### Death Timer
At 0 HP from lethal damage:
- **6 rounds** maximum survival
- Each round closer to death
- May be conscious or not
- Can perform no useful actions

### Mortal Wound States
The dying character might be:
- Unconscious and still
- Screaming in agony
- Trying to hold wounds closed
- Begging for mercy
- Making final peace
- Cursing their killer

All are mechanically helpless.

### Instant Death
Additional damage to mortally wounded:
- Always kills immediately
- No chance for stabilization
- Execution of the helpless
- Mercy or cruelty

## Types of Defeat

### Physical Defeat
Most common type:
- Weapon damage
- Environmental hazards
- Disease/poison
- Exhaustion
- Starvation/thirst

### Mental Defeat
Breakdown from:
- Psychic assault
- Overwhelming fear
- Psychological torture
- Morale collapse
- Madness

Still uses HP system but described differently.

### Technical Defeat
Systems failure:
- Oxygen depletion
- Pressure loss
- Radiation poisoning
- Cybernetic overload
- Drug overdose

## Special Cases

### Execution Attacks
Against helpless targets:
- No roll needed
- Automatic mortal wound
- Includes unconscious
- Bound victims
- Sleeping targets

Against unaware targets:
- Special rules apply
- See [Special Situations](../combat/special-situations.md)

### Massive Damage
No instant-kill threshold but:
- Heavy weapons may instant-kill
- Explosions devastating
- GM describes severity
- Narrative trumps mechanics

### Zero-G Deaths
Special considerations:
- Blood spheres float
- Bodies drift
- Decompression risks
- No "falling" pose
- Cleanup difficult

## Describing Death

### Combat Deaths
Quick and violent:
- Laser burns through armor
- Blade finds vital spot
- Bullets tear flesh
- Explosion tears apart
- Vacuum exposure

### Slow Deaths
The 6-round timer:
- Round 1-2: Shock, denial
- Round 3-4: Desperation
- Round 5-6: Final moments
- Each round matters
- Drama increases

### Last Words
Dying characters might:
- Reveal secrets
- Curse enemies
- Forgive killers
- Warn allies
- Express regrets

GM controls NPCs, players control PCs.
