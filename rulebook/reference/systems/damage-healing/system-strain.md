# System Strain

The human body can only endure so much augmentation, stimulation, and enhancement before critical systems fail. System strain represents this physical limit.

## Understanding System Strain

### What Is System Strain?
A measure of bodily stress from:
- Medical stimulants
- Cybernetic implants
- Psionic effort
- Toxic exposure
- Extreme augmentation
- Alien substances

### The Strain Limit
**Maximum Strain = Constitution Score**

Examples:
- Constitution 10 = 10 max strain
- Constitution 14 = 14 max strain  
- Constitution 18 = 18 max strain

Never modified by anything.

### Exceeding the Limit
Going over maximum strain:
- **Instant death**
- No save
- No stabilization
- Body shuts down
- Overdose/overload

Always track strain carefully.

## Sources of Strain

### Medical Stims
Most common source:
- Basic stim: 1 strain
- Enhanced stim: 2 strain
- Military stim: 2 strain
- Combat drugs: Varies
- Toxin purges: 1+

Instant healing has a price.

### Cyberware
Permanent installations:
- Each piece: 1+ strain
- Always "on"
- Can't remove easily
- Limits augmentation
- Choose carefully

See [Cyberware](../../equipment/cyberware/).

### Psychic Powers
From effort expenditure:
- Pushing limits
- Torch effects
- Desperate acts
- Varies by power
- Usually severe

See [Psionics](../../psionics/).

### Environmental
Extreme conditions:
- Radiation exposure
- Toxic atmospheres
- Alien biochemistry
- Pressure extremes
- Temperature damage

GM determines amount.

### Diseases/Toxins
Biological threats:
- Alien plagues: 1-3
- Poison damage: Varies
- Parasites: Ongoing
- Infections: Progressive
- Bio-weapons: Severe

Often with other effects.

## Recovery

### Natural Recovery Rate
**1 strain per day of rest**

Requirements:
- Full rest
- No new strain
- Decent conditions
- Adequate food/water
- Time passes

Cannot accelerate naturally.

### Medical Care
With proper treatment:
- Same rate (1/day)
- Better conditions
- Monitoring helps
- Prevents complications
- No faster healing

### Pretech Solutions
Extremely rare options:
- Instant strain removal
- System cleansing
- Total body refresh
- Nearly mythical
- Campaign-specific

## Managing Strain

### Track Carefully
Essential bookkeeping:
- Current strain
- Maximum strain  
- Sources of strain
- Recovery timeline
- Safety margin

One mistake = death.

### Planning Usage
Before taking strain:
- Check current total
- Calculate new total
- Ensure survival
- Plan recovery
- Have backup

### Emergency Reserves
Wise practices:
- Keep 2-3 buffer
- Emergency only
- Last resort stims
- Escape option
- Stay alive

## Strain in Combat

### Combat Drugs
Temporary boosts:
- Strength enhancers
- Speed boosters
- Pain blockers
- Berserkers
- Focus aids

All cause strain for benefit.

### Tactical Decisions
During firefights:
- Stim now or wait?
- Risk the strain?
- Save for later?
- Already too high?
- Death either way?

### Desperate Measures
When cornered:
- Multiple stims
- Push the limit
- Accept consequences
- Win or die
- No tomorrow

## Character Building

### High Constitution Value
More strain capacity means:
- More stims usable
- More cyberware
- Survival buffer
- Flexibility
- Power options

Consider during creation.

### Strain Management Builds
Some concepts:
- **Cyber Warrior**: Permanent strain
- **Stim Junkie**: Temporary boosts
- **Natural**: Avoids strain
- **Psychic**: Effort strain
- **Survivor**: Buffer maintained

### Equipment Choices
Strain affects:
- Cyberware selection
- Stim supplies
- Drug usage
- Risk tolerance
- Play style

## Common Strain Scenarios

### The Overloaded Merc
Too much cyberware:
- High permanent strain
- Little stim buffer
- One drug from death
- Powerful but fragile
- Needs caution

### The Combat Medic
Stim distribution:
- Tracks party strain
- Manages supplies
- Tactical healing
- Knows limits
- Saves lives

### The Desperate Escape
Pushing limits:
- Multiple wounds
- Stims depleted
- One more needed
- Risk vs death
- Calculated gamble

### The Augment Addict
Wants everything:
- Cybereyes (1)
- Dermal armor (2)
- Reflex booster (1)
- Neural interface (1)
- Not enough Constitution

## Strain and NPCs

### NPC Strain Limits
Usually simplified:
- Assume Con 10
- Track if important
- Ignore if minor
- Focus on PCs
- Drama over detail

### Enemy Strain Use
Opponents may:
- Use combat drugs
- Have cyberware
- Push limits
- Die from strain
- Make mistakes

## Special Circumstances

### Alien Physiology
Non-humans might:
- Different limits
- Faster recovery
- Immunity to some
- Vulnerability others
- Unknown effects

### Robots/AI
Mechanical beings:
- No strain system
- Different limits
- Overheating instead?
- Power management
- Damage accumulation

### Psychics
Special considerations:
- Effort causes strain
- Torching severe
- Combined with stims
- Very dangerous
- Plan carefully

## Long-term Effects

### Chronic Strain
Repeated overuse:
- Organ damage
- Shortened lifespan
- Addiction potential
- System breakdown
- Medical complications

Optional rule for gritty games.

### Permanent Damage
From strain overdose (survived):
- Reduced Constitution
- Organ replacement
- Chronic conditions
- Dependency
- Scarring

Not standard rules.

## Strain Economics

### Stim Dealing
Black market:
- High demand
- Risk premium
- Quality varies
- Addiction feeds
- Criminal element

### Medical Tourism
Seeking treatment:
- Better facilities
- Strain cleansing
- Rare procedures
- High cost
- Travel risks

### Insurance Issues
Coverage questions:
- Self-inflicted?
- Combat related?
- Legal usage?
- Approved stims?
- Claim denied?

## Common Questions

### Does armor affect strain?
- No, Constitution only
- Armor irrelevant
- Physical limit
- Internal issue

### Can I reduce permanent strain?
- Remove cyberware (maybe)
- Very difficult
- Surgery required
- Not always possible
- Scars remain

### Do all stims cause strain?
- Yes, healing ones
- Food/water no
- Basic medicine no
- Anything "instant" yes

### What if I'm at max strain?
- No more stims
- No more cyber
- Very vulnerable
- Rest required
- Plan carefully
