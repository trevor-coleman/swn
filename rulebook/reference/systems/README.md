# Game Systems

This chapter covers the core mechanical systems that govern play in Stars Without Number. These rules determine success and failure, life and death, and the outcomes of uncertain situations.

## Core Systems

### [Basic Mechanics](basic-mechanics/)
The fundamental rules that underlie all gameplay:
- **[Skill Checks](basic-mechanics/skill-checks.md)** - Testing character competence
- **[Saving Throws](basic-mechanics/saving-throws.md)** - Avoiding immediate perils
- **[Opposed Checks](basic-mechanics/opposed-checks.md)** - Contests between characters
- **[Aiding Others](basic-mechanics/aiding-others.md)** - Working together

### [Combat](combat/)
Rules for deadly encounters:
- **[Combat Sequence](combat/combat-sequence.md)** - How battles unfold
- **[Actions in Combat](combat/actions.md)** - What you can do
- **[Attack and Defense](combat/attack-defense.md)** - Hitting and avoiding hits
- **[Movement and Positioning](combat/movement.md)** - Tactical positioning
- **[Special Situations](combat/special-situations.md)** - Unique combat scenarios
- **[Morale](combat/morale.md)** - When enemies flee

### [Damage and Healing](healing/)
Surviving injury and recovering:
- **[Taking Damage](healing/damage.md)** - How injuries work
- **[Death and Dying](healing/death.md)** - Mortality rules
- **[Natural Healing](healing/natural-healing.md)** - Recovery over time
- **[Medical Treatment](healing/medical-treatment.md)** - First aid and medicine
- **[System Strain](healing/system-strain.md)** - Pushing beyond limits

### [Environmental Hazards](environmental-hazards/)
Dangers beyond combat:
- **[Vacuum and Pressure](environmental-hazards/vacuum.md)** - Space dangers
- **[Radiation](environmental-hazards/radiation.md)** - Invisible killers
- **[Extreme Temperatures](environmental-hazards/temperature.md)** - Heat and cold
- **[Toxins and Disease](environmental-hazards/toxins.md)** - Biological threats
- **[Falling](environmental-hazards/falling.md)** - Gravity kills

## Understanding the Systems

### Design Philosophy
Stars Without Number systems are designed to be:
- **Fair**: The dice don't favor anyone
- **Lethal**: Combat is dangerous for everyone
- **Clear**: Outcomes are understandable
- **Flexible**: Applicable to many situations

### No Plot Armor
Unlike some RPGs, Stars Without Number provides no narrative protection:
- No "fate points" or "story currency"
- Characters can die from bad decisions or bad luck
- The dice determine outcomes, not narrative needs
- This creates genuine tension and meaningful choices

### The Role of Dice
Dice serve as an impartial arbiter:
- Even the GM doesn't know outcomes in advance
- Creates surprise and emergent storytelling
- Makes player choices meaningful
- Rewards good planning over assuming success

## Quick Rules Reference

### Basic Dice Mechanics
- **Skill Checks**: 2d6 + skill + attribute modifier ≥ difficulty
- **Saving Throws**: 1d20 ≥ save score (lower is better)
- **Attack Rolls**: 1d20 + base attack + skill + attribute ≥ AC
- **Damage**: Weapon die + attribute modifier

### Difficulty Guidelines
| Task | Skill DC | Save Modifier |
|------|----------|---------------|
| Trivial | 6 | +4 |
| Easy | 8 | +2 |
| Average | 10 | 0 |
| Hard | 12 | -2 |
| Extreme | 14+ | -4 |

### Time Scales
- **Round**: 6 seconds (combat)
- **Scene**: ~15 minutes (one encounter)
- **Hour**: Exploration/travel
- **Day**: Healing/downtime

## Customizing the Systems

### Making it Less Lethal
If your group prefers more heroic gameplay:
- Give PCs maximum HP at each level
- Allow "death saves" when dropped to 0 HP
- Reduce enemy damage or numbers
- Provide more healing opportunities
- Announce dangerous situations clearly

### Making it More Lethal
For gritty realism:
- Use critical hit rules
- Track ammunition strictly
- Apply fatigue and exhaustion
- Limit healing resources
- Use morale for PCs too

### House Rules
Common modifications:
- **Luck Points**: Reroll one die per session
- **Heroic Surge**: Extra action once per scene
- **Cinematic Damage**: Describe wounds narratively
- **Group Initiative**: Simplify combat flow
