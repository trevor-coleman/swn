# Die Hard

You are surprisingly hard to kill. You can survive injuries or bear up under stresses that would incapacitate a less determined hero.

## Benefits

### Level 1
- **Bonus HP**: Gain +2 maximum hit points per character level
  - This applies retroactively if taken after first level
  - At level 5, you'd have +10 HP from this focus
- **Auto-Stabilize**: Automatically stabilize if mortally wounded by anything smaller than a Heavy weapon
  - No need for ally intervention or medical aid
  - Just stop dying on your own

### Level 2
- **Death Defiance**: The first time each day that you are reduced to zero hit points by an injury, you instead survive with one hit point remaining
  - Once per day only
  - Cannot save you from Heavy weapons or similar massive trauma
  - Resets after a full rest

## Understanding the Benefits

### Hit Point Bonus
The +2 HP per level is significant:
- Level 1: 1d6+2 base (3-8 HP) becomes 5-10 HP
- Level 5: ~20 HP becomes ~30 HP  
- Level 10: ~40 HP becomes ~60 HP

This makes you 25-50% tougher than normal characters.

### Stabilization
Normally when reduced to 0 HP:
- You're mortally wounded and dying
- Need immediate medical attention
- Will die in minutes without help

With Die Hard Level 1:
- You stabilize automatically
- Still at 0 HP and incapacitated
- But not actively dying
- Exception: Heavy weapons still need normal stabilization

### Death Defiance
This is a true life-saver:
- Sniper headshot drops you to -5 HP? You're at 1 HP instead
- Explosions would kill you? Once per day, you survive
- Gives you one more round to act, escape, or get help
- Does NOT work against truly massive damage (Heavy weapons, falling from orbit, etc.)

## Playing a Die Hard Character

### Combat Tactics
- Take calculated risks others can't
- Draw fire away from squishier allies
- Hold chokepoints and defensive positions
- Buy time for tactical withdrawals

### Roleplay Elements
- Covered in scars from past injuries

- "I've had worse" attitude
- Last to retreat, first to advance

### When You're Tough
- Volunteer for dangerous missions
- Take point in hostile territory  
- Stand between danger and allies

## Mechanical Considerations

### What Counts as "Heavy Weapons"
Typically includes:
- Vehicle-mounted weapons
- Crew-served weapons
- Massive explosions
- Extreme environmental damage

### Daily Reset
"First time each day" means:
- 24-hour period or full rest
- GM determines exact reset timing
- Usually dawn or after 8 hours rest

### Stacking with Other HP Sources
Die Hard stacks with:
- Constitution bonuses
- Warrior class HP bonus
- Biopsionics healing
- Cyberware (if allowed)

## Equipment Considerations

Maximize your survivability with:
- **Best armor** you can afford and wear
- **Medical supplies** for after combat
- **Defensive gear** like cover-generating items
- **Backup weapons** for when you're at 1 HP

## Comparison with Ironhide

| Aspect | Die Hard | Ironhide |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **HP Bonus** | +2 per level | None |
| **AC Bonus** | None | 15 + half level |
| **Special** | Stabilize, 1 HP save | Immune to primitive |
| **Focus** | Not dying | Not getting hit |

Both together create an incredibly durable character.
