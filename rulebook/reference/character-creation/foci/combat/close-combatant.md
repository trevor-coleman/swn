# Close Combatant

You've had all too much practice at close-in fighting and desperate struggles with pistol or blade. You're extremely skilled at avoiding injury in melee combat, and at level 2 you can dodge through a melee scrum without fear of being knifed in passing.

## Benefits

- **Bonus Skill**: Gain any combat skill as a bonus
- **Melee Defense**: Gain +1 AC against melee attacks
- **Superior Instincts**: Against melee attacks, you may add your skill level to damage rolls

### Level 2
- **Free Movement**: You can move through melee combat without triggering attacks of opportunity
- **Combat Flow**: After dropping a foe in melee, you gain a free Move action
  - Must be used immediately
  - Can chain multiple kills for multiple moves

## Understanding the Benefits

## Playing a Close Combatant

### Combat Flow Examples

#### The Chain Kill
1. Move to Enemy A
2. Attack and kill Enemy A
3. Free Move to Enemy B
4. Next turn: Kill Enemy B
5. Free Move to Enemy C
6. Repeat until out of enemies

#### The Rescue
1. Ally surrounded by enemies
2. Move through enemies (no AoO)
3. Kill enemy threatening ally
4. Free Move to pull ally out
5. No opportunity attacks on either

### Action Economy
Maximizing free moves:
- Target wounded enemies
- Soften with ranged first
- Coordinate with allies
- Save big threats for last

## Equipment Priorities

### Defensive Gear
1. **Best Armor Available**: Stack with AC bonus

3. **Defensive Mods**: Further protection
4. **Mobility Aids**: Grav harness, etc.

### Offensive Options

- **Shock Weapons**: Soften groups
- **Variable Weapons**: Handle any defense
- **Backup Weapons**: Always armed

## Tactical Mastery

### Using Free Movement

### AC Optimization
Total AC calculation:
- Base 10

- +1 from this focus
- Potentially 20+ AC vs melee

### Opportunity Attack Immunity
Level 2 means you can:
- Run past enemy lines
- Leave melee freely
- Reposition constantly
- Never get locked down

## Common Scenarios
