- Target saves or dies

With Level 2:

### Concealment Options
What counts as "knife or pistol sized":
- Any pistol-type weapon
- Knives and small blades
- Stun guns/tasers
- Garrotes or similar
- Small explosives/grenades

## Equipment Priorities

### Essential Gear
1. **Concealable Weapons**: Core tools
2. **Stealth Gear**: Chameleon suits, etc.
3. **Security Bypasses**: For infiltration
4. **False IDs**: Social infiltration

### Advanced Equipment

- **Holo-projector**: Disguises
- **Toxin Dispensers**: Silent kills
- **EMP Devices**: Disable security

## Tactical Considerations

### Perfect Ambush (Level 1)
"Cannot miss" means:
- No attack roll needed
- Automatic hit at point-blank
- Still roll damage normally
- Must be from surprise

### Mobile Execution (Level 2)
Movement options:
- Full move before attack
- Split move (half before, half after)
- Enables hit-and-run tactics
- Can reach distant targets

### When Execution Fails
If target survives:
- You've still done max damage
- They know you're there
- Have escape plan ready
- Consider finishing them normally

## Mission Planning

### Infiltration Phase
- Use Sneak for approach
- Bypass or eliminate guards
- Disable security systems
- Reach execution position

### Execution Phase
- Ensure surprise
- Draw weapon (On Turn)
- Execute attack
- Confirm kill

### Exfiltration Phase
- Pre-planned escape route
- Dispose of evidence
- Avoid pursuit
- Reach safe house

## Common Pitfalls

### Over-Reliance on Execution
- Not every target can be executed
- Some enemies immune to instant death
- Need backup combat skills
- Practice normal fighting too

### Poor Planning
- Rushing leads to detection
- Always have Plan B
- Know security patterns
- Time your approach

### Limited Weapon Options
- Concealment limits arsenal
- Can't hide rifles or big weapons
- Need to work with smaller tools
- Quality over quantity
