# Ironhide

Whether through uncanny reflexes, remarkable luck, gengineered skin fibers, or subtle telekinetic shielding, you have natural defenses equivalent to high-quality combat armor. The benefits of this focus don't stack with armor, though Dexterity or shield modifiers apply.

## Benefits

### Level 1
- **Natural Armor**: You have an innate Armor Class of 15 plus half your character level, rounded up

### Level 2  
- **Primitive Immunity**: Your abilities render you immune to unarmed attacks and primitive weaponry as if you wore powered armor

## Understanding Natural Armor

### AC Calculation by Level
Your base AC without armor:
- Level 1-2: AC 16 (15 + 1)
- Level 3-4: AC 17 (15 + 2)
- Level 5-6: AC 18 (15 + 3)
- Level 7-8: AC 19 (15 + 4)
- Level 9-10: AC 20 (15 + 5)

### What Stacks
These bonuses ADD to your natural armor:
- Dexterity modifier
- Shield bonus
- Cover bonuses
- Other AC mods (not armor)

### What Doesn't Stack
Use the BETTER of:
- Your Ironhide AC
- Any worn armor AC
- Never combine both

## Level 2 Immunity

### Primitive Weapon Immunity
You're immune to:
- All unarmed attacks (Punch skill)
- TL0 weapons (clubs, swords, bows)
- TL1 weapons (crossbows, steel)
- TL2 weapons (early firearms)
- TL3 weapons (modern guns)

### What Can Still Hurt You
- TL4+ weapons (laser, plasma, mag)
- Special materials (pretech)
- Environmental damage
- Psychic attacks
- Explosions (even if primitive)
