# Savage Fray

You are a whirlwind of bloody havoc in melee combat, and can survive being surrounded far better than most combatants.

## Benefits

### Level 1
- **Bonus Skill**: Gain Stab as a bonus skill
- **Whirlwind Strike**: All enemies adjacent to you at the end of your turn whom you have not attacked suffer the Shock damage of your weapon
  - Only if their AC is not too high to be affected by Shock

### Level 2
- **Untouchable Fury**: After suffering your first melee hit in a round, any further melee attacks from other assailants automatically miss you
  - If the attacker who hits you has multiple attacks, they may attempt all of them
  - Other foes around you simply miss

## Understanding the Benefits

### Whirlwind Strike Mechanics
How it works:
- Happens at END of your turn
- Affects ALL adjacent enemies
- Only those you DIDN'T attack
- They take your weapon's Shock
- Normal Shock AC limits apply

### Example Turn
1. You're surrounded by 4 enemies
2. You attack Enemy A (your main action)
3. End of turn: Enemies B, C, D take Shock
4. You damage 4 enemies with 1 action

### Untouchable Fury Details
Once hit in melee:
- First attacker completes all attacks
- ALL other melee attackers miss
- Resets each round
- Ranged attacks still work normally
- Makes you nearly immune to mobs
