# Shocking Assault

You're extremely dangerous to enemies around you. The ferocity of your melee attacks stresses and distracts enemies even when your blows don't draw blood.

## Benefits

### Level 1
- **Bonus Skill**: Gain Punch or Stab as a bonus skill
- **Armor Piercing Shock**: The Shock damage of your weapon treats all targets as if they were AC 10
  - Assuming your weapon is capable of harming the target in the first place

### Level 2
- **Enhanced Shock**: Gain a +2 bonus to the Shock damage rating of all melee weapons and unarmed attacks
- **Minimum Damage**: Regular hits never do less damage than this Shock would do on a miss

## Understanding Shock Mechanics

### Normal Shock Rules
- Shock damages on a miss
- Only affects AC equal or less than Shock rating
- Example: Shock 2/AC 15 only affects AC 15 or lower

### With Shocking Assault
Level 1 changes:
- Your Shock treats everyone as AC 10
- Shock 2/AC 15 becomes Shock 2/AC 10 for you
- But really works on ANY AC
- Only limit: Can your weapon hurt them?

Level 2 additions:
- All Shock values +2
- Minimum damage on hits
- Massive reliability boost
