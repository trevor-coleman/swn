# Unarmed Combatant

Your empty hands are more dangerous than knives and guns in the grip of the less gifted. Your unarmed attacks are counted as melee weapons when it comes to binding up opponents wielding rifles and similar long arms, though you need at least one hand free to do so.

## Benefits

### Level 1
- **Bonus Skill**: Gain Punch as a bonus skill
- **Scaling Damage**: Your unarmed attacks become more dangerous as your Punch skill increases:
  - Punch-0: 1d6 damage
  - Punch-1: 1d8 damage + Shock 1/AC 15
  - Punch-2: 1d10 damage + Shock 2/AC 15
  - Punch-3: 1d12 damage + Shock 3/AC 15
  - Punch-4: 1d12+1 damage + Shock 4/AC 15
- **Note**: Add Punch skill to damage rolls, but don't double-add to Shock

### Level 2
- **Armor Penetration**: You know locks and twists that use powered servos against their wearer
  - Unarmed attacks count as TL4 weapons for overcoming advanced armors
- **Guaranteed Damage**: Even on a miss with a Punch attack, you do an unmodified 1d6 damage

## Understanding the Scaling

### Damage Progression
Your fists become increasingly lethal:
- Starting: Basic brawling (1d6)
- Trained: Professional fighter (1d8)
- Expert: Devastating strikes (1d10)
- Master: Bone-crushing blows (1d12)
- Legendary: Superhuman force (1d12+1)

### Shock Damage
Starting at Punch-1:
- Automatically damages lightly armored foes
- Shock value equals Punch skill level
- Affects AC 15 or less
- Makes you dangerous even when missing

### Total Damage Output
At Punch-4:
- Hit: 1d12+1 base + 4 skill = 7-17 damage
- Miss: 4 Shock vs AC 15 or less
- With Level 2: 1d6 even on total miss
