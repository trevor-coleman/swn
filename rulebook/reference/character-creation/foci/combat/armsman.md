# Armsman

You have an unusual competence with thrown weapons and melee attacks. This focus' benefits do not apply to unarmed attacks or projectile weapons. For thrown weapons, you can't use the benefits of the Armsman focus at the same time as Gunslinger.

## Benefits

### Level 1
- **Bonus Skill**: Gain Stab as a bonus skill
- **Quick Draw**: Draw or sheath a Stowed melee or thrown weapon as an Instant action
- **Damage Bonus**: Add your Stab skill level to melee or thrown weapon damage rolls or Shock damage (if the weapon has any)

### Level 2
- **Armor Penetration**: Your primitive melee and thrown weapons count as TL4 weapons for overcoming advanced armors
- **Guaranteed Damage**: Even on a miss with a melee weapon, you do an unmodified 1d4 damage to the target, plus any Shock damage
  - This bonus damage doesn't apply to thrown weapons or Punch skill attacks

## Understanding the Benefits

### Damage Scaling
Your Stab skill directly increases damage:
- Stab-0: +0 damage
- Stab-1: +1 damage
- Stab-2: +2 damage
- Stab-3: +3 damage
- Stab-4: +4 damage

This applies to both regular damage AND Shock damage.

### Tech Level Advantage
At Level 2, your primitive weapons can hurt power armor:
- Normal primitive weapons: Stopped by TL4+ armor
- Your primitive weapons: Affect all armor types
- Keeps lower-tech weapons viable

### Miss Damage
Level 2's guaranteed damage means:
- You always do at least 1d4 on a melee miss
- Plus any weapon Shock damage
- Makes you dangerous even when rolling poorly

## Playing an Armsman

### Combat Positioning
- Get into melee range quickly
- Use thrown weapons while closing
- Switch to melee when adjacent
- Position for Shock damage

### Action Economy
With Instant draw/sheath:
- Start with ranged weapon out
- Instant: Holster gun
- Move: Close to melee
- Main: Melee attack
- Never waste actions on weapon swaps

### Weapon Selection
- Carry multiple weapon types
- Thrown for approach
- Heavy melee for damage
- Light melee for backup
- All benefit from your bonuses

## Equipment Priorities

### Essential Gear
1. **Monoblade**: Best melee damage
2. **Throwing Blades**: Silent ranged option
3. **Mag Weapon**: Primitive but effective
4. **Combat Shield**: Melee defense

### Advanced Equipment
- **Variable Sword**: Multiple damage types
- **Distortion Field**: Melee protection
- **Kinesis Wraps**: Thrown weapon recovery
- **Combat Drugs**: Boost melee performance

## Tactical Considerations

### vs Ranged Enemies
- Use cover while approaching
- Thrown weapons while closing
- Force melee engagement
- Shock damage affects groups

### vs Melee Enemies
- Superior damage output
- Level 2 gives guaranteed damage
- Can out-trade most opponents
- Primitive weapons still effective

### vs Armored Enemies
- Level 2 penetrates all armor
- Shock damage still applies
- Multiple attacks wear them down
- Consider specialized ammo/weapons

## Common Mistakes

### Over-Specialization
- Don't ignore ranged combat entirely
- Carry backup weapons
- Have options for different ranges

### Poor Positioning
- Getting surrounded is still dangerous
- Need escape routes
- Watch for ranged threats

### Ignoring Thrown Weapons
- They use your bonuses too
- Good for starting combat
- Can't combine with Gunslinger

## FAQ

**Q: Does the damage bonus apply to thrown weapons?**
A: Yes, both the skill damage bonus and Shock bonus.

**Q: Can I use this with advanced melee weapons?**
A: Yes, but they already overcome armor without Level 2.

**Q: Does miss damage stack with weapon Shock?**
A: Yes, you get 1d4 + weapon's Shock damage.

**Q: Can I dual-wield for more attacks?**
A: Yes, but each attack is at -2 to hit.

## Optimization Tips

### Skill Priority
1. Maximize Stab (core skill)
2. Exert (for movement/charging)
3. Survival skill (Notice/Survive)
4. Social or technical skill

### Weapon Loadout
- Primary: Monoblade or culture blade
- Thrown: 3-4 throwing blades
- Backup: Knife or small weapon
- Special: Stun baton for captures

### Advancement Path
- Level 1-2: Focus on Stab skill
- Level 3+: Develop secondary skills
- Consider Close Combatant at higher levels
