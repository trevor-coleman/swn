# Gunslinger

You have a gift with a gun. While this talent most commonly applies to slugthrowers or energy weapons, it is also applicable to thrown weapons, bows, or other ranged weapons that can be used with the Shoot skill. For thrown weapons, you can't use the benefits of the Armsman focus at the same time as Gunslinger.

## Benefits

### Level 1
- **Bonus Skill**: Gain Shoot as a bonus skill
- **Quick Draw**: You can draw or holster a Stowed ranged weapon as an On Turn action (normally a Move action)
- **Precision Damage**: Add your Shoot skill level to a ranged weapon's damage roll

### Level 2
- **Rapid Reload**: Once per round, reload a ranged weapon as an On Turn action (if it normally takes no more than one round)
- **Grazing Shot**: Even on a miss with a Shoot attack, you do an unmodified 1d4 damage

## Tactical Applications

### Damage Output
Your Shoot skill bonus to damage means:
- At Shoot-1: +1 damage
- At Shoot-2: +2 damage
- At Shoot-3: +3 damage
- At Shoot-4: +4 damage

This stacks with attribute modifiers and weapon mods.

### Action Economy
Quick draw and rapid reload allow you to:
- Switch weapons without losing attacks
- Maintain fire with weapons that need frequent reloading
- Draw and fire in the same round when ambushed
- Keep multiple weapons ready for different situations

### Never Waste a Shot
Level 2's grazing shot ensures:
- You always do some damage when shooting
- Minimum 1d4 even on misses
- Pressure on enemies every round
- Useful against high-AC targets

## Comparison with Armsman

| Aspect | Gunslinger | Armsman |
|--------|------------|---------|
| **Range** | All ranged weapons | Melee and thrown only |
| **Quick Action** | Draw/holster | Draw/sheath |
| **Level 2** | Reload + graze | Primitive as TL4 + miss damage |
