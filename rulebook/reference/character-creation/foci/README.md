# Choosing a Focus

Every character has a focus - a special knack, perk, or aptitude that grants them unique benefits. Foci represent specialized training, natural talents, or hard-won experience that sets your character apart.

## Understanding Foci

### What is a Focus?
A focus is an additional capability beyond your class abilities. Each focus has one or more levels with increasingly powerful effects. The benefits stack - if you have level 2 in a focus, you also get all level 1 benefits.

### Focus Flexibility
Any character can pick any focus - it doesn't have to match your class. A Psychic can take Unarmed Combatant, while a Warrior might be a skilled Healer. Just explain how your character developed this talent.

### Skill Bonuses
Many foci grant a bonus skill level as part of their level 1 benefits. These work like any other skill gain:
- If you don't have the skill: Gain it at level-0
- If you have it at level-0: Raise to level-1
- If already at level-1: Pick any other non-psychic skill

### Taking Foci
Unless specified otherwise, each focus can only be taken once. You can't take Die Hard twice for extra hit points. Some skill-based foci can be taken multiple times for different skills.

## Starting Foci

All beginning characters get **one focus level**.

Additional focus levels based on class:
- **Experts/Partial Experts**: +1 level in a non-combat focus
- **Warriors/Partial Warriors**: +1 level in a combat focus

You can spend both levels on the same focus to start at level 2.
