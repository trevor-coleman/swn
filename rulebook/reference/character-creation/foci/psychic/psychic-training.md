# Psychic Training

You've had special training in a particular psychic discipline. You must be a Psychic or have taken the Partial Psychic class option as an Adventurer to pick this focus. In the latter case, you can only take training in the discipline you initially chose as a Partial Psychic. As with most foci, this focus can be taken only once.

## Requirements

- Must be a Psychic or Partial Psychic
- Cannot be taken by characters with Wild Psychic Talent
- Can only be taken once

## Benefits

### Level 1
- **Bonus Psychic Skill**: Gain any psychic skill as a bonus
  - If this improves it to level-1 proficiency, choose a free level-1 technique from that discipline
- **Increased Effort**: Your maximum Effort increases by one

### Level 2
- **Automatic Advancement**: When you advance a level, the bonus psychic skill automatically gets one skill point put toward increasing it or purchasing a technique from it
  - You may save these points for later if more are required
  - Points are awarded retroactively if you take this focus level later

## For Full Psychics

### Discipline Options
As a full Psychic, you can choose any discipline:
- **Biopsionics**: Add healing to your repertoire
- **Metapsionics**: Control psychic energy itself
- **Precognition**: See the future
- **Telekinesis**: Add combat options
- **Telepathy**: Mind reading and control
- **Teleportation**: Ultimate mobility

### Strategic Choices

## For Partial Psychics

### Limitations
- Can only enhance your single chosen discipline
- Cannot learn new disciplines
- Still get +1 Effort and automatic advancement

### Maximizing Your Discipline

If your discipline is **Biopsionics**:
- Start with Biopsionics-0
- Psychic Training raises to Biopsionics-1

- +1 Effort for more healing
- Automatic advancement each level

Similar benefits apply to any chosen discipline.

## Understanding Automatic Advancement

### How It Works
Every character level, you gain 1 skill point for your bonus psychic skill:
- Can increase skill level (costs 1 point per level)
- Can buy techniques (cost varies)
- Can save points for expensive purchases

### Example Progression
Starting at 1st level with Psychic Training Level 2:
- Level 2: +1 point (save)
- Level 3: +1 point (2 total, buy level-2 skill)
- Level 4: +1 point (save)
- Level 5: +1 point (2 total, buy technique)

### Retroactive Points
If you take Level 2 of this focus at 5th character level:
- Immediately gain 4 skill points (levels 2-5)
- Can spend immediately or save
- Continue gaining 1 per level
