# Wild Psychic Talent

Some men and women are born with a very limited form of MES, the mental condition that allows for the use of psychic powers. While these people are not true psychics, these "wild talents" can create one limited psychic effect. Training is not always required to develop this ability, and their MES is so mild that they don't suffer the risk of madness or brain damage that more developed psychics risk should they use their powers without proper training.

## Requirements & Limitations

- **Cannot be taken by**: Psychics or Partial Psychics
- **Not considered psychics**: Don't count as psychics for other game purposes
- **Cannot torch**: No desperate power boosts available
- **Fixed Effort**: Treated as having 1 Effort at Level 1, 2 at Level 2

## Benefits

### Level 1
- **Choose One**:
  - A psychic discipline's level-0 core power, OR
  - A level-1 technique that stands alone (doesn't require other powers)
- **1 point of Effort** to fuel your ability

### Level 2
- **Maximum Effort**: Now 2 points
- **Second Ability**: Pick another power following Level 1 guidelines
  - Can augment your first pick if applicable
  - Still can't get level-1 core powers

## Understanding Standalone Techniques

### What Makes a Technique "Standalone"?
A technique that functions without requiring another power:

**Valid Examples**:
- **Telekinetic Armory**: Creates weapons from nothing
- **Eidetic Memory**: Perfect recall ability
- **Spatial Awareness**: See through barriers
- **Tissue Integrity Field**: Heal groups

**Invalid Examples**:
- **Mastered Succor**: Augments Psychic Succor
- **Psychic Harmonization**: Modifies other powers
- **Surge Momentum**: Enhances other techniques

### Level 2 Augmentation
At Level 2, you can pick augmenting techniques IF they modify your Level 1 pick:
- Level 1: Psychic Succor (level-0)
- Level 2: Mastered Succor (augments your healing)

## Wild Talent vs True Psychics

|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Power Level** | 1-2 abilities | Full disciplines |
| **Effort** | Max 2 | Scales with level |
| **Advancement** | None | Continuous |
| **Torching** | No | Yes |
| **Training Risk** | None | Brain damage |

## Playing a Wild Talent

### Power Management
With only 1-2 Effort:
- Use powers sparingly
- Save for critical moments
- Refresh between scenes
- Can't push beyond limits

### Roleplay Aspects
- Powers manifest naturally
- No formal training
- May not understand how it works
- Could fear or embrace ability
- Not part of psychic community

### Hidden Advantage
- Not obviously psychic
- Hard to detect with powers
- Can surprise enemies
- Avoid psychic prejudice

## Mechanical Considerations

### Effort Refresh
- Scene: Returns after 15 minutes
- Day: Returns after rest
- Wild Talents can't torch for more

### Power Activation
- Same as true psychics
- Main Action unless specified
- Visible effects vary by power
- Commit Effort as normal

### Limitations
- Can't learn psychic skills
- Can't take Psychic Training
- Don't benefit from psychic gear
- Can't join psychic academies

## FAQ

**Q: Can I pick any technique at Level 1?**
A: Only if it stands alone without requiring other powers.

**Q: Can I get a discipline's level-1 core power?**
A: No, only level-0 core powers or standalone techniques.

**Q: What happens if I become a true psychic later?**
A: GM discretion, but typically you'd lose Wild Talent and rebuild.

**Q: Do I count as psychic for gear/effects?**
A: No, you're not a true psychic.

**Q: Can I hide my powers?**
A: Yes, easier than true psychics due to minimal MES.

## Optimization Tips

### Choose Complementary Powers
- Healing + Enhanced healing
- Attack + Defense
- Information + Communication

### Match Your Class
- Warriors: Combat powers
- Experts: Utility powers
- Match powers to skills

### Consider Campaign Style
- Combat heavy: Offensive/defensive powers
- Investigation: Information powers
- Social: Telepathy options

## Common Combinations

### Level 1 + 2 Synergies
1. **Oracle** → **Telekinetic Deflection** (sense and avoid danger)
2. **Psychic Succor** → **Mastered Succor** (better healing)
3. **Telepathic Contact** → **Transmit Thought** (two-way communication)
4. **Spatial Awareness** → **Personal Apportation** (see and teleport)
