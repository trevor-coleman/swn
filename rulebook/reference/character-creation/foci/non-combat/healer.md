# Healer

Healing comes naturally to you, and you're particularly gifted at preventing the quick bleed-out of wounded allies and comrades.

## Benefits

### Level 1
- **Bonus Skill**: Gain Heal as a bonus skill
- **Rapid Stabilization**: Attempt to stabilize one mortally-wounded adjacent person per round as an On Turn action (normally a Main Action)
- **Enhanced Healing**: When rolling Heal skill checks, roll 3d6 and drop the lowest die

### Level 2
- **Double Healing**: Stims or other technological healing devices applied by you heal twice as many hit points as normal
- **Field Medicine**: Using only basic medical supplies, you can heal 1d6+Heal skill hit points to every injured person in your group with ten minutes of first aid
  - Can be applied to each target only once per day
  - Requires basic medical supplies

## Understanding the Benefits

### Stabilization Mastery
Normal stabilization:
- Requires a Main Action
- One person per round maximum
- Need to be adjacent
- Requires Heal/Int check

With Healer Level 1:
- Only an On Turn action
- Can still take other actions
- One person per round
- Much more likely to succeed with 3d6 drop lowest

### Enhanced Healing Devices
Standard healing items with Level 2:
- **Medkit** (1d6+1): Becomes 2d6+2
- **Stim** (1d6): Becomes 2d6
- **Advanced Medkit** (2d6+2): Becomes 4d6+4

This effectively doubles your medical supplies.

### Group Healing
The Level 2 field medicine ability:
- Heals entire party in 10 minutes
- 1d6 + Heal skill (so 1d6+1 to 1d6+4)
- Each person once per day
- Requires basic supplies (medkit)
- Stacks with other healing
