# Specialist

You are remarkably talented at a particular skill. Whether a marvelous cat burglar, a world-famous athlete, a brilliant engineer, or some other savant, your expertise is extremely reliable. You may take this focus more than once for different skills.

## Benefits

### Level 1
- **Bonus Skill**: Gain a non-combat, non-psychic skill as a bonus
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Roll 3d6 and drop the lowest die for all skill checks in this skill

### Level 2
- **Supreme Mastery**: Roll 4d6 and drop the two lowest dice for all skill checks in this skill

## Understanding the Math

The probability benefits are substantial:

**Normal 2d6 Roll**:
- Average: 7
- Chance of 8+: 41.67%
- Chance of 10+: 16.67%

**Level 1 (3d6 drop lowest)**:
- Average: ~8.46
- Chance of 8+: ~66%
- Chance of 10+: ~31%

**Level 2 (4d6 drop 2 lowest)**:
- Average: ~9.66
- Chance of 8+: ~84%

This means difficult tasks become routine and "impossible" tasks become merely challenging.
