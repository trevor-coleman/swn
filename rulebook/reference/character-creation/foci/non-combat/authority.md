# Authority

You have an uncanny kind of charisma about you, one that makes others instinctively follow your instructions and accept your commands. At level 1, this is impressed upon NPCs by your bearing and behavior, while level 2 reflects voice pitch modulation, pheromone production, or other, less scientifically-plausible means of influencing others. Where this focus refers to followers, it means NPCs who have voluntarily chosen to be in your service. PCs never count as followers.

## Benefits

### Level 1
- **Bonus Skill**: Gain Lead as a bonus skill
- **Natural Leader**: Once per day, you can make a request from an NPC who is not openly hostile to you
  - Roll a Cha/Lead skill check at a difficulty of the NPC's Morale score
  - If you succeed, they will comply with the request, provided it is not harmful or extremely uncharacteristic
- **Inspiring Presence**: Your followers and employees have a Morale score of 12

### Level 2
- **Enhanced Authority**: Your authority now extends to any NPC of 4 HD or fewer with whom you can communicate
  - Gain a +1 bonus on all skill checks to request things from NPCs
  - NPCs have to make a Mental saving throw to act in a way that would threaten you, your property, or your evident interests
  - This effect lasts until they fulfill a request or suffer a round of combat damage from you or your allies

## Understanding Authority

### Level 1 Request Mechanics
- Once per day special request
- Target can't be openly hostile
- Roll vs their Morale score
- Success = reasonable compliance
- Can't request harm or wildly out of character acts

### What's Reasonable?
Valid requests:
- "Let us pass without inspection"
- "Give us a discount on supplies"
- "Tell us what you know about X"
- "Look the other way this once"
- "Help us with this task"

Invalid requests:
- "Attack your friends"
- "Give us everything you own"
- "Betray your deepest beliefs"
- "Harm yourself"

### Level 2 Compulsion
More powerful effect:
- Works on any 4 HD or less NPC
- They must save to act against you
- Protects you, property, and interests
- Broken by combat damage
- Or by fulfilling a request
