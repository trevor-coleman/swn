# Unique Gift

Whether due to exotic technological augmentation, a unique transhuman background, or a remarkable human talent, you have the ability to do something that's simply impossible for a normal human.

This is a special focus which serves as a catch-all for some novel power or background perk that doesn't have a convenient fit in the existing rules. A transhuman who can function normally in lethal environments, a nanotech-laden experimental subject with a head full of exotic sensors, or a brilliant gravitic scientist who can fly thanks to their personal tech might all take this focus to cover their special abilities.
