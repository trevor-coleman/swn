# Starfarer

You are an expert in the plotting and execution of interstellar spike drills. While most experienced pilots can manage conventional drills along well-charted spike routes, you have the knack for forging new drill paths and cutting courses too dangerous for lesser navigators.

## Benefits

### Level 1
- **Bonus Skill**: Gain Pilot as a bonus skill
- **Routine Excellence**: You automatically succeed at all spike drill-related skill checks of difficulty 10 or less

### Level 2
- **Master Navigator**: Double your Pilot skill for all spike drill-related skill checks
- **Drive Enhancement**: Spike drives of ships you navigate are treated as one level higher
  - Drive-1 → Drive-2
  - Drive-2 → Drive-3
  - Up to maximum Drive-7
- **Speed Drilling**: Spike drills you personally oversee take only half the time they would otherwise require

## Understanding Spike Drills

### Basic Drill Mechanics
Normal spike drilling:
- Pilot check to navigate
- Days of travel in metaspace
- Risk of mishaps
- Limited by drive rating
- Requires drill routes

### Starfarer Advantages
Your expertise provides:
- Auto-success on easy drills
- Better chances on hard drills
- Access to more systems
- Faster travel times
- Safer navigation

### Time Savings
Normal vs Starfarer times:
- 2 days → 1 day
- 6 days → 3 days
- 10 days → 5 days
- Huge strategic advantage
