# Character Advancement

When characters accumulate enough experience points, they advance a character level. New PCs start out at level one and the most experienced, capable heroes in the sector might reach level ten. Advancing beyond level ten is usually prohibitively difficult, though possible at the GM's discretion.

## Experience Points

### Gaining Experience

To advance in capability, PCs need to earn experience points. Once they accumulate enough experience, they can advance to the next character level, representing the sharpening of their skills and the heroic veterancy that comes of surviving perils and dire challenges.

### Sources of Experience

Experience rewards vary by campaign style:
- **Treasure Hunting**: XP for wealth recovered
- **Goal Achievement**: XP for completing personal/party objectives
- **Mission Success**: XP for completing adventures
- **Spending Credits**: XP only when wealth is spent
- **GM's Choice**: Whatever fits the campaign theme

In general, one "successful" gaming session should earn about 3 XP.

### Experience Requirements

| Character Level | Total XP Required |
|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | 0 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 6 |
| 4 | 12 |
| 5 | 18 |
| 6 | 27 |
| 7 | 39 |
| 8 | 54 |
| 9 | 72 |
| 10 | 93 |
| 11+ | +24 per level |

Note: This table provides fast early progression that slows at higher levels.

## Benefits of Gaining a Level

Once you have enough XP, you immediately gain all benefits. No training time required - your adventures have honed your abilities.

### 1. Roll Additional Hit Points

**Process**:
1. Roll a number of d6 equal to your new level
2. Add Constitution modifier to each die (minimum 1 per die)
3. If total exceeds current HP, use new total
4. If not, increase maximum HP by 1

**Warrior Bonus**: Warriors and Partial Warriors add +2 HP per level

**Example**: A 2nd-level character with Con 14 (+1) reaching 3rd level rolls 3d6+3. A 3rd-level Warrior would roll 3d6+6 plus Con modifiers.

### 2. Improve Attack Bonus

**Base Attack Bonus** = Half character level (rounded down)

**Class Variations**:
- **Warriors**: Use full character level
- **Partial Warriors**: Add +1 at levels 1 and 5

| Level | Expert/Psychic | Warrior | Partial Warrior |
|-------|----------------|---------|-----------------|
| 1 | +0 | +1 | +1 |
| 2 | +1 | +2 | +1 |
| 3 | +1 | +3 | +1 |
| 4 | +2 | +4 | +2 |
| 5 | +2 | +5 | +3 |
| 6 | +3 | +6 | +3 |
| 7 | +3 | +7 | +3 |
| 8 | +4 | +8 | +4 |
| 9 | +4 | +9 | +4 |
