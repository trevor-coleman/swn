# Backgrounds

Your character's background represents their life before becoming an adventurer. It determines their starting skills and may have shaped their worldview and abilities.

## Choosing a Background

You can either:
1. **Roll randomly**: Roll 1d20 to determine your background
2. **Pick one**: Choose a background that fits your character concept
3. **Create custom**: Work with your GM to create a unique background with any three appropriate skills

## How Backgrounds Work

Each background provides:
- **Free Skill**: A skill essential to that profession (gained at level-0)
- **Quick Skills**: Three pre-selected skills for easy character creation
- **Growth Table**: Potential attribute improvements or bonus skills
- **Learning Table**: Additional skill options

### Skill Options

After choosing your background, you can either:

**Option A - Pick Skills** (Controlled):
- Take your background's free skill
- Pick 2 more skills from the Learning table
- Cannot pick "Any Skill" entries or use Growth table

**Option B - Roll Skills** (Random):
- Take your background's free skill
- Make 3 rolls total, divided between Growth and Learning tables
- Growth table can improve attributes or grant skills
- More variety but less control

- Why did you leave your old life?
- What drives you to adventure?
- How does your background influence your goals?
- What connections or enemies might you have?
