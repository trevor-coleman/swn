# Criminal

Whether thief, murderer, forger, smuggler, spy, or some other variety of malefactor, your hero was a criminal. Some such rogues are guilty only of crossing some oppressive government or offending a planetary lord, while others have done things that no civilized society could tolerate. Still, their ability to deal with the most desperate and dangerous of contacts and navigate the perils of a less-than-legal adventure can make them attractive associates for a party of freebooters bent on profit and glory more than strict legality.
