# Thug

## Overview
Your hero was a bruiser. They might have had a notional allegiance to some so-called "army", or have been part of some crime boss' strong-arm crew, or simply been a private contractor of misfortune for those who failed to pay up. They might have even been a fist in a righteous cause, defending their neighborhood from hostile outsiders or serving as informal muscle for a local leader in need of protection. Whatever the details, they've had to move on from their old life, and their new one is likely to involve a similar application of directed force.
