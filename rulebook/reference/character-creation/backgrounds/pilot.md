# Pilot

## Overview
A pilot's role is a broad one in the far future. The most glamorous and talented navigate starships through the metadimensional storms of interstellar space, while less admired figures fly the innumerable intra-system shuttles and atmosphere craft that serve in most advanced systems. On other worlds, this career might reflect a long-haul trucker, or a horse-riding messenger, or an intrepid sailor on an alien sea. As the Pilot skill covers all these modes of transport, any character whose role revolves around vehicles or riding beasts might justify their selection of this career.
