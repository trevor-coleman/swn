# Official

## Overview
Most advanced worlds run on their bureaucracies, the legions of faceless men and women who fill unnumbered roles in keeping the government running as it should. Your hero was one such official. Some were law enforcement officers, others government office clerks or tax officials or trade inspectors. However necessary the work may be, it is often of unendurably tedious nature, and any man or woman with an adventurous spark to their blood will soon find themselves desperate for more exciting use of their talents.
