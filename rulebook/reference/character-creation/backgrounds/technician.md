# Technician

## Overview
Old things break and new things need to be made. Whether a humble lostworlder blacksmith or an erudite astronautic engineer, your hero made a career out of building and mending the fruits of technology. While almost every society has a need for such services, not all of them treat their providers as generously as a technician might wish. Sometimes, these same talents can be turned toward less licit ends, and a skilled technician's expertise is always useful to an adventuring group that plans to rely on anything more sophisticated than a sharpened stick.
