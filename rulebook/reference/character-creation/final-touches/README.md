# Final Touches

You're almost finished creating your character. These final steps will complete your hero and make them ready for adventure.

## Step 1: Choose a Bonus Skill

Pick one more non-psychic skill of your choice. This represents:
- Personal hobbies
- Side interests  
- Natural talents
- Past experiences

### Skill Bonus Rules
- If you don't have the skill: Gain it at level-0
- If you have it at level-0: Increase to level-1
- If already at level-1: Cannot choose it

### Suggestions by Concept
- **Combat Character**: Notice, Survive, or Exert
- **Social Character**: Perform, Trade, or Connect
- **Technical Character**: Know, Pilot, or Fix
- **Stealthy Character**: Notice, Pilot, or Survive

## Step 2: Calculate Hit Points

Your hit points measure how close you are to death or defeat. When you run out, your character is dead or unable to continue fighting.

### Maximum Hit Points
Roll 1d6 and add your Constitution modifier (minimum 1 HP)

**Class Bonuses:**
- **Warriors**: Add +2 to the total
- **Partial Warriors**: Add +2 to the total
- **Everyone else**: No bonus

### Examples
- Constitution 14 (+1): 1d6+1 HP (2-7 HP)
- Constitution 8 (-1): 1d6-1 HP (minimum 1 HP)
- Warrior with Con 14: 1d6+3 HP (4-9 HP)

## Step 3: Record Attack Bonus

Your base attack bonus determines how accurately you strike in combat.

### Base Attack Bonus by Class
- **Warriors**: +1 at 1st level
- **Partial Warriors**: +1 at 1st level
- **Everyone else**: +0 at 1st level

This increases as you gain levels (see advancement rules).

## Step 4: Calculate Saving Throws

Saving throws represent your ability to avoid or resist various dangers.

### Physical Save
**15 minus the better of Strength or Constitution modifier**
- Resists: Poison, disease, exhaustion
- Example: Str +1, Con +2 = Save 13

### Mental Save  
**15 minus the better of Wisdom or Charisma modifier**
- Resists: Psychic powers, mind control, fear
- Example: Wis -1, Cha +0 = Save 15

### Evasion Save
**15 minus the better of Dexterity or Intelligence modifier**
- Resists: Explosions, traps, area effects
- Example: Dex +2, Int +1 = Save 13

### Important Notes
- Lower saves are better
- Minimum save is typically 15
- Can be 16+ with penalties in both attributes

## Step 5: Choose Starting Equipment

You have two options for starting gear:

### Option A: Equipment Package
Choose a pre-made package from the [Equipment Packages](../equipment-packages/) section
- Includes all basic gear
- Balanced for different roles
- No starting credits

### Option B: Starting Credits
Roll 2d6 Ã— 100 for starting credits (200-1,200)
- Average: 700 credits
- Buy equipment from lists
- More customization

## Step 6: Languages

All PCs start knowing certain languages based on their background.

### Automatic Languages
- **Mandate**: Universal trade language (all PCs)
- **Native Language**: From your homeworld
- **Background Languages**: Based on your history

### Bonus Languages
Characters with certain skills know additional languages:

**Know Skill:**
- Level-0: +1 language
- Level-1: +3 languages
- Level-2: +6 languages
- Level-3: +10 languages
- Level-4: All sector languages

**Connect Skill** (if well-traveled):
- Same progression as Know skill

## Step 7: Calculate Final Statistics

### Weapon Statistics
**Attack Bonus = Base Attack + Skill + Attribute Modifier**
- Melee: Usually Strength or Dexterity
- Ranged: Usually Dexterity
- Energy weapons: +1 additional bonus

**Damage = Weapon Damage + Attribute Modifier**
- Same attribute as attack

### Armor Class
**AC = Armor AC + Dexterity Modifier**
- Multiple armors don't stack
- Shields add their bonus

### Encumbrance
Count your readied and stowed items:
- **Readied**: Immediately accessible
- **Stowed**: In backpack/storage
- Compare to carrying capacity

## Step 8: Character Details

- Personal preference
- Nicknames/callsigns
