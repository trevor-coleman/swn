## Character Concepts

### What You Need to Know
- The year is 3200, centuries after the collapse known as the Silence
- You are an adventurer who has chosen a starfaring life
- Some worlds have recovered advanced technology; others remain primitive
- Your character needs motivation to act and work with a group
- The galaxy is dangerous - lone wolves and passive characters don't survive

### Creating Goals
Every character should start with a goal, whether simple ("become wealthy") or complex ("overthrow the empire that conquered my world"). This drives your character to adventure.

### Sandbox Play
Stars Without Number is a sandbox game - you choose your own path through an entire interstellar sector. Work with your GM and respond to the opportunities presented.

## Character Creation Philosophy

### Rolling vs Building
Stars Without Number traditionally uses random generation ("rolling") rather than point-buy character building. This creates unexpected characters whose personalities emerge through play.

However, players who prefer full control can use:
- Attribute arrays instead of rolling
- Selected backgrounds instead of random tables
- Chosen skills rather than rolled results

Both approaches are valid - choose what works for your group!
