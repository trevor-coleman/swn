# Character Classes

Your class represents your hero's primary approach to solving problems and surviving the dangers of space. While your background shaped who you were, your class defines who you are becoming as an adventurer.

## The Four Classes

### [Expert](expert.md)
Masters of skill and expertise. Whether doctors, pilots, hackers, or thieves, Experts excel at non-combat challenges and can reliably succeed when others would fail.
- **Key Ability**: Reroll one failed skill check per scene
- **Bonus**: Extra non-combat focus and skill points

### [Psychic](psychic.md)
Rare individuals with Metadimensional Extroversion Syndrome (MES) who can channel exotic energies to perform impossible feats. They wield powers of the mind but must carefully manage their efforts.
- **Key Ability**: Psychic powers and techniques
- **Bonus**: Two psychic skill picks and Effort pool

### [Warrior](warrior.md)
Hardened combatants who excel at violence. From street thugs to elite soldiers, Warriors survive battles that would kill others.
- **Key Ability**: Once per scene, negate a hit or turn a miss into a hit
- **Bonus**: Extra combat focus, better attack bonus, more hit points

### [Adventurer](adventurer.md)
The versatile class for heroes who don't fit neatly into other categories. Adventurers blend aspects of two other classes, trading raw power for flexibility.
- **Key Ability**: Mix and match partial class abilities
- **Bonus**: Customizable based on chosen partial classes

## Choosing Your Class

### Consider Your Concept
Your class should match how you envision your character solving problems:
- **Skill Challenges**: Choose Expert
- **Mental Powers**: Choose Psychic
- **Combat**: Choose Warrior
- **Mixed Approach**: Choose Adventurer

### Class Doesn't Limit Background
A peaceful customs clerk could be a Warrior with hidden combat talents. A street tough might be an Expert with surprising technical skills. Choose the class that fits your desired playstyle, not just your background.

## Advancement

As you gain experience levels, your class provides:
- **Increased hit points** based on class
- **Better attack bonuses** at different rates
- **Additional focuses** at certain levels
- **Class-specific improvements** (skill points, psychic techniques, etc.)

## Class and Party Role

Consider how your class will contribute to the group:
- **Experts** handle technical challenges, negotiations, and specialized tasks
- **Psychics** provide unique solutions through their powers
- **Warriors** protect the party and handle combat threats
- **Adventurers** fill gaps and provide backup capabilities

## Multiclassing

Stars Without Number doesn't use traditional multiclassing. Instead:
- The **Adventurer** class lets you combine aspects of other classes
- **Foci** let any class gain specialized abilities
- Your background skills remain regardless of class
