# Warrior

Whether a hiveworld thug, barbarian lostworlder, gengineered combat hominid, or a natural-born killer wasting their potential in a desk job, your hero has a real talent for inflicting mayhem. Combat in Stars Without Number is extremely dangerous, but your hero has the talents to survive situations that would kill a less martial adventurer.

## Core Concept

Warriors are gifted purveyors of violence who excel at combat in all its forms. They combine superior training, natural talent, and an uncanny survival instinct that keeps them alive when bullets start flying. While anyone can pick up a gun, Warriors make violence into an art form.

## Class Abilities

### Combat Focus
You gain a free level in a combat-related focus associated with your background. This represents your particular style of mayhem and is in addition to the focus level all PCs receive. You may spend both levels on the same combat focus if desired.

### Warrior's Luck
Once per scene, as an Instant ability, you can either:
- **Negate** a successful attack roll against you (take no damage)
- **Convert** a missed attack roll you made into a successful hit

This ability can be used after dice are rolled but cannot be used against:
- Environmental damage
- Effects without an attack roll
- Hits on a vehicle you're occupying

### Enhanced Durability
You gain two extra maximum hit points at each character level, making you significantly tougher than other classes.

## Starting Values

### Hit Points
Roll 1d6+2 and add your Constitution modifier (minimum 1 HP). This higher base reflects your superior conditioning.

### Attack Bonus
Your base attack bonus equals your character level (+1 at 1st level). Warriors have the best attack progression of any class.
