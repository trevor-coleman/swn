# Adventurer

The Adventurer class is the catch-all for heroes who don't fit neatly into the other three categories. Perhaps your mercenary spent her girlhood at a psychic academy, or maybe your combat medic knows more about using a laser rifle than most physicians do. You can use the Adventurer class to customize your hero's abilities, trading focus for wider versatility.

## Core Concept

Adventurers split their focus between different spheres, gaining weaker versions of each class' benefits. For example, an Adventurer who is a psionic warrior-adept might have considerable powers of telekinetic force and brutal expertise at bare-handed combat, but they won't have access to the wider psionic potential of an unrestricted Psychic or the death-defying combat luck of a hardened Warrior.

## Creating an Adventurer

To define your Adventurer's abilities, pick **two** of the following three partial classes:

### Partial Expert
You gain a talented knack with skills:
- Free level in a non-combat focus related to your background
- One extra skill point each level (for non-psychic, non-combat skills)
- Represents professional training or natural talent

### Partial Psychic
You are a restricted psychic with limited powers:
- Pick one psychic discipline as a bonus skill at level-0
- Can only learn/improve this single discipline
- Maximum Effort = 1 + psychic skill level + better of Wis/Con modifier (minimum 1)
- Can learn techniques from your chosen discipline

### Partial Warrior
You have significant combat training:
- Free level in a combat focus related to your background
- +1 attack bonus at 1st and 5th levels
- +2 maximum hit points per level
- Represents martial training or natural combat ability

## Starting Values

### Hit Points
- Base: Roll 1d6 + Constitution modifier (minimum 1 HP)
- If Partial Warrior: Add +2 to the roll

### Attack Bonus
- Base: Half character level, rounded down (+0 at 1st level)
