# Expert

Your hero is exceptionally good at useful skills. Doctors, cat burglars, starship pilots, grifters, technicians, or any other concept that focuses on expertise in non-combat skills should pick the Expert class. Experts are the best at such skills and gain more of them than other classes do.

## Core Concept

Just as a Warrior can be relied upon to make a shot when the chips are down, an Expert has a knack for succeeding at the moments of greatest importance. Their natural talent bleeds over into everything they do, making them invaluable members of any adventuring party.

## Class Abilities

### Masterful Expertise
Once per scene, you can reroll a failed skill check, taking the new result if it's better. This benefit applies to any skill check, even those you aren't specially trained in.

### Specialist Focus
You gain a free level in a non-combat focus related to your background. Most Experts take Specialist in their main skill, though Diplomat, Starfarer, Healer, or another focus might suit better. This is in addition to the focus level all PCs receive.

You may spend both focus levels on the same focus, starting with level 2 if desired.

### Skill Advancement
When you advance an experience level, you gain a bonus skill point that can be spent on any non-combat, non-psychic skill. You can save this point to spend later if you wish.

## Starting Values

### Hit Points
Roll 1d6 and add your Constitution modifier (minimum 1 HP).

### Attack Bonus
Your base attack bonus equals half your character level, rounded down (+0 at 1st level).
