# Psychic

Your hero has received training in controlling their natural Metadimensional Extroversion Syndrome (MES), and can wield the psychic powers that come from that strange affliction. Controlling and developing psychic abilities is an extremely demanding process but allows for feats wholly impossible to ordinary men and women.

## Rarity and Background

Psychics are extremely rare in the general population. Most worlds see rates between one in ten thousand to one in a hundred thousand who have MES. Many go their entire lives without realizing their capabilities. Others who try to use their powers without training almost inevitably end up brain-damaged or driven mad by unmediated metadimensional energy.

Your hero was fortunate enough to find a psychic academy or training institution. They may have come to this later in life, or been recruited young by a society that watches for MES symptoms.

## Social Standing

Different worlds treat psychics differently:
- **Accepting Worlds**: Psychics enjoy lucrative employment and respect
- **Fearful Worlds**: Memories of the Scream lead to persecution
- **Regulated Worlds**: Psychics must register and serve the state
- **Underground Worlds**: Psychics hide their abilities or face consequences

## Class Abilities

### Psychic Disciplines
Unlike other classes, you can learn psychic disciplines and their associated techniques. These grant supernatural abilities impossible for ordinary humans.

### Starting Psychic Skills
When you pick this class, choose any two psychic skills as bonus skills. You can pick the same one twice to obtain level-1 proficiency in it and a free level-1 technique from that discipline.

### Effort Pool
You have an Effort score used to fuel psychic abilities:
- **Maximum Effort** = 1 + highest psychic skill + better of Wisdom or Constitution modifiers
- Minimum 1 Effort even with penalties
- Effort refreshes based on how it was committed

## Starting Values

### Hit Points
Roll 1d6 and add your Constitution modifier (minimum 1 HP).

### Attack Bonus
Your base attack bonus equals half your character level, rounded down (+0 at 1st level).

- With training, it grants incredible power
- The condition cannot be "cured" or removed

### Daily Life
- Psychics may experience sensory differences
- Strong emotions can trigger involuntary effects
- Regular meditation helps maintain control
- Some substances interfere with psychic abilities

## Torching

When desperate, psychics can "torch" to:
- Fuel a power without available Effort
- Enhance a power beyond normal limits
- Activate abilities when drained

**Warning**: Torching causes severe damage and should only be used in dire circumstances.
