# Skills

Skills represent your character's learned capabilities and training. Every star-faring adventurer has skills that help them survive the dangers of space.

## Skill Levels

Skills are rated from level-0 to level-4:

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Level-0** | Basic competence, such as an ordinary practitioner would have |
| **Level-1** | An experienced professional, clearly better than most |
| **Level-2** | Veteran expert, respected even by those with considerable experience |
| **Level-3** | Master of the skill, likely one of the best on the planet |
| **Level-4** | Superlative expertise, one of the best in the entire stellar sector |

## How Skills Work

### Basic Competence
Your hero is assumed to be competent at all ordinary functions of their role and background. A moisture farmer knows how to maintain equipment; a corporate heir knows how to read balance sheets. You never fail at basic tasks unless circumstances make them unusually difficult.

### Skill Checks
When attempting something difficult or under pressure, you make a skill check:
1. Roll 2d6
2. Add the most applicable attribute modifier
3. Add your skill level
4. Compare to the difficulty number (usually 6-12)

**No Skill Penalty**: If you don't have even level-0 in a skill, take a -1 penalty. Some technical tasks may be impossible without training.

**Maximum**: No starting character can have a skill higher than level-1.
