# Fix

## Overview
Create and repair devices both simple and complex. How complex will depend on your character's background; a lostworlder blacksmith is going to need some study time before he's ready to fix that broken fusion reactor, though he can do it eventually. Roll it to fix things, build things, and identify what something is supposed to do.
