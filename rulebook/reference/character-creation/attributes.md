# Attributes

Attributes describe your character's basic physical and mental capabilities. Every character has six attributes that range from 3 to 18, with 3 being barely functional and 18 representing the peak of normal human ability.

## The Six Attributes

| Attribute | Affects |
|-----------|---------|
| **Strength** | Physical prowess, melee combat, carrying gear, brute force |
| **Dexterity** | Speed, evasion, manual dexterity, reaction time, combat initiative |
| **Constitution** | Hardiness, enduring injury, resisting toxins, going without food or sleep |
| **Intelligence** | Memory, reasoning, technical skills, general education |
| **Wisdom** | Noticing things, making judgments, reading situations, intuition |
| **Charisma** | Commanding, charming, attracting attention, being taken seriously |

## Generating Attributes

You have two options for determining your character's attributes:

### Option 1: Rolling
1. Roll 3d6 six times
2. Assign the results in order to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma
3. You may then change one attribute of your choice to 14

### Option 2: Array
Assign the following scores to your attributes in any order:
- **14, 12, 11, 10, 9, 7**

Note: If you use the array method, you cannot replace one score with a 14.

## Attribute Modifiers

Once you've determined your attributes, record the modifier for each. These modifiers are applied to skill checks and other rolls related to the attribute.

| Attribute Score | Modifier |
|----------------|----------|
| 3 | -2 |
| 4-7 | -1 |
| 8-13 | +0 |
| 14-17 | +1 |
| 18 | +2 |

## Using Attributes in Play

When making skill checks, attack rolls, or other dice rolls, you use the attribute modifier, not the full score. The scores themselves serve as:
- Guidelines for roleplaying your character
- Baselines that may change through backgrounds or advancement
- Indicators of your character's natural strengths and weaknesses

## Example: Rolling Attributes

Sarah is creating a new character and decides to roll for attributes:
1. She rolls 3d6 six times: 10, 4, 13, 16, 8, 7
2. She assigns them in order:
   - Strength: 10 (+0)
   - Dexterity: 4 (-1)
   - Constitution: 13 (+0)
   - Intelligence: 16 (+1)
   - Wisdom: 8 (+0)
   - Charisma: 7 (-1)
3. She uses her free 14 to replace the Dexterity 4, giving her:
   - Strength: 10 (+0)
   - Dexterity: 14 (+1)
   - Constitution: 13 (+0)
   - Intelligence: 16 (+1)
   - Wisdom: 8 (+0)
   - Charisma: 7 (-1)

This character is brilliant but socially awkward, with good reflexes compensating for average physical capabilities.

## Attribute Changes

Attributes can change during play through:
- Background benefits (during character creation)
- Certain foci that improve attributes
- Permanent injuries or enhancements
- Advanced technology or psychic powers

Always update your modifiers when attributes change.

## Roleplaying Attributes

Consider how your attributes shape your character:
- **Low Strength (3-7)**: Struggle with heavy loads, avoid physical confrontation
- **High Intelligence (14-18)**: Quick learner, good memory, technical aptitude
- **Low Wisdom (3-7)**: Impulsive, poor judgment, miss obvious clues
- **High Charisma (14-18)**: Natural leader, memorable presence, persuasive

Remember that even a +0 modifier represents average human capability - your character is competent even without bonuses!
