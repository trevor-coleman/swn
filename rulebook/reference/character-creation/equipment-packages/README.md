# Equipment Packages

Rather than choosing gear from the Equipment chapter piece by piece, you can take a premade package instead of taking your starting credits. These packages provide everything a starting character needs for their role.

## How Equipment Packages Work

### Choosing a Package
- Select one package that fits your character concept
- Take everything listed in the package
- Do NOT also take starting credits (it's one or the other)
- All packages include basic survival gear

### Recording Equipment
Once you've chosen your equipment:
1. **Weapons**: Note damage and hit bonus
   - Hit bonus = Base attack + Skill + Attribute modifier
   - Damage = Weapon damage + Attribute modifier
2. **Armor**: Note your Armor Class
   - AC = Armor AC + Dexterity modifier
   - Multiple armors don't stack

### Attribute Modifiers for Weapons
- **Melee weapons**: Usually Strength or Dexterity
- **Ranged weapons**: Usually Dexterity
- **Energy weapons**: Add +1 to hit (no recoil/windage)

## Understanding Package Values

### Package Components
Each package typically includes:
- **Primary weapon** for your role
- **Backup weapon** (usually a knife)
- **Appropriate armor** for expected danger
- **Role-specific gear** (tools, scanners, etc.)
- **Basic supplies** (backpack, compad)
- **Power/ammunition** as needed
- **Small credit reserve** for incidentals

### Approximate Values
Packages are worth roughly 2,000-2,500 credits:
- Better combat gear = less starting money
- More specialized tools = less versatility
- Balanced to be fair regardless of choice

### Customization
With GM permission, you might:
- Swap similar-value items
- Trade gear for credits (at 50% value)
- Combine partial packages
- Create new packages for unique roles
