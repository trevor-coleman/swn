## Learning Psychic Skills

### Starting Psychics
- Choose any two psychic skills at level-0
- Can pick the same skill twice for level-1
- Picking a skill at level-1 grants a free level-1 technique

### Advancement
- Psychic skills improve like other skills
- Each level unlocks new techniques
- Techniques must be learned separately
- Higher levels require more Effort

## Effort System
- Maximum Effort = 1 + highest psychic skill + better of Wisdom/Constitution modifier
- Effort refreshes after rest
- Techniques require Effort commitment
- Scene-long or day-long commitments

## Legal Considerations
Many worlds restrict or ban psychic use:
- Telepathy often illegal without consent
- Registration requirements common
- Psychic academies heavily regulated
- Rogue psychics face persecution
