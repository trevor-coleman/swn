## Creating Memorable NPCs

## Quick NPC Generator Example

**Rolling all dice:**
- Background: 3 = Aspiring bourgeoise
- Role: 6 = Merchant
- Problem: 5 = Superior dislikes them
- Desire: 3 = Wants promotion
- Trait: 2 = Avarice

**Result**: A middle-class merchant whose boss hates them, desperately wants to advance, and is obviously greedy. Perhaps they'll offer the PCs a cut of profits if they help sabotage their superior's shipment...
