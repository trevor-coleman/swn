# One-Roll Urban Encounters

Quick urban encounters for when you need to distract the PCs or fill time while you plan.

## How to Use
1. Roll on each table or pick appropriate elements
2. Adapt details to fit the planet's culture
3. Don't force engagement - let PCs work to avoid if they want
4. Use avoidance efforts to buy planning time

## Quick Urban Encounter Generator

### Example Process
1. **Conflict**: Roll 2 = Respect/authority issue
2. **Antagonist**: Roll 6 = Corrupt official
3. **Venue**: Roll 2 = Public plaza
4. **PC Hook**: Roll 3 = Happens around them
5. **Event**: Roll 5 = Someone being blamed
6. **Feature**: Roll 10 = Cops present but passive

**Result**: In the public plaza, a corrupt official is publicly blaming someone (maybe a merchant who refused bribes?) for a crime. The cops are there but clearly in the official's pocket. It happens right as the PCs walk through.
