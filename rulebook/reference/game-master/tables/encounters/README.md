## Using These Tables

### When to Use
- Players go somewhere unexpected
- You need time to think
- Session pacing needs a jolt
- Random events add verisimilitude

### How to Use
1. **Don't Force It** - Let PCs avoid if clever
2. **Adapt Details** - Fit the planet's culture
3. **Scale Appropriately** - Match party strength
4. **Connect to Story** - Tie to ongoing events when possible

## Quick Encounter Philosophy

### Purpose
- **Buy Time**: While you plan the next scene
- **Add Texture**: Make world feel alive
- **Test Resources**: Drain HP, ammo, time
- **Provide Opportunities**: Loot, allies, information

### Avoidance
- Should be possible but costly
- Time, resources, or reputation
- Creates its own mini-challenge
- Still achieves time-buying goal

## Universal Encounter Elements

### The Hook
Why PCs can't just walk away:
- Blocks their path
- Threatens innocents
- Offers opportunity
- Involves them directly
- Damages their reputation

### The Stakes
What happens if they don't engage:
- Someone gets hurt
- They lose resources
- They miss opportunity
- They gain enemies
- They lose time

### The Resolution
Quick ways to end it:
- Combat (1-3 rounds)
- Skill challenge
- Resource expenditure
- Social solution
- Creative bypass

## Encounter Difficulty

### Easy (Speedbump)
