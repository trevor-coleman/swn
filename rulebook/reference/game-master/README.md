## Core Philosophy

### Your Table, Your Rules
Stars Without Number is built on a 40+ year old mechanical chassis - it can handle modification. The game belongs to you and your players, not to any distant designer. House rules that make sense for your group are not just acceptable, they're encouraged.

### Know Your Players
Generic advice for the "Typical Gamer" is far less valuable than your personal knowledge of Bob, Eunice, Feng, and Tyler at your table. Design your campaign for the specific people playing it.

## Quick GM Principles

### When to Roll Dice
- **Do Roll**: When failure has consequences
- **Do Roll**: When time pressure exists
- **Don't Roll**: For routine professional tasks
- **Don't Roll**: When success is certain
- **Don't Roll**: When players take clever direct action

### Combat Guidelines
- Combat should rarely be forced
- Let PCs ambush and use environment
- Enemies retreat when losing
- Only fanatics fight to the death

### Investigation Tips
1. Identify must-find information
2. Give clues for logical actions
3. Don't hide vital info behind rolls
4. Provide NPC help if PCs flail
5. Let tardiness have consequences

### Skill Check Philosophy
- Be charitable about non-roll accomplishments
- Don't spam checks for extended tasks
- Let PCs be competent at their specialties
- One roll determines general success/failure
- Give choices, not just more rolls

## Common Situations

### Replacing Dead PCs
1. Have players pre-roll replacements
2. Get new PC in action ASAP
3. Same level as dead PC
4. Pre-establish connection reasons
5. Common origins:
   - Ship crew member
   - Local contact
   - Prisoner of enemies
   - Fellow traveler

### Handling Salvage
- Most goods too hard to fence
- Damaged armor usually worthless
- Black market weapons need contacts
- Quick sale = 50% value
- Fence = 10-20% value
- Focus on portable valuables

### Social Encounters
**Option 1**: Pure dice (Talk skill)
- Fair to non-charismatic players
- Consistent with combat system

**Option 2**: Hybrid approach
- Good arguments lower difficulty
- Poor arguments raise difficulty
- Both player skill and character skill matter

**Option 3**: Skill sets consequences
- High skill = better failure results
- Low skill = worse success results

## GM Tools

### Quick NPC Stats
When you need an NPC instantly:
- **HP**: 1 per level (max 10)
- **AC**: 10 + armor (if any)
- **Attack**: +1 per 2 levels
- **Damage**: By weapon
- **Skills**: +1 per level in specialty

### Morale Guidelines
- **Thugs**: Flee at 50% casualties
- **Guards**: Flee at 75% casualties
- **Elite**: Flee when clearly losing
- **Fanatics**: Fight to the death

### Difficulty Guidelines
- **6**: Trivial for professionals
- **8**: Standard professional task
- **10**: Challenging task
- **12**: Difficult even for experts
- **14**: Near-impossible

## Campaign Management

### Session Zero Topics
1. Lethality level preference
2. Skill check philosophy
3. Social encounter style
4. House rules discussion
5. Campaign tone and themes

### Between Sessions
- Convert faction turns to news
- Update NPC attitudes
- Prepare replacement PCs
- Adjust difficulty to group

### Long-Term Considerations
- PCs will want to trade eventually
- Death will happen eventually
- Investigations need multiple paths
- Combat should stay scary

## Remember

This game is designed for house rules and campaign-specific systems. You're not going to break it by adding what makes sense for your table. The rules as written work for most groups, but your specific group's fun is more important than generic balance.
