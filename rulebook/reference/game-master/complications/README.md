# Common Complications

How to handle the most frequent challenges that arise in Stars Without Number games.

## Character Death

### The Reality
- Average 3rd level PC: ~15-20 HP
- Average pistol: 1d6+1 damage
- One lucky shot can kill
- Even high-level warriors max at 60-70 HP

### Approaches to Death

#### Old-School (Default)
- Let dice fall where they may
- Dead means dead
- Roll replacement immediately
- Adds tension and accomplishment

#### Story-Focused
- 0 HP = "gravely wounded"
- Always saveable with medical attention
- Reserve true death for dramatic moments
- Good for character-invested players

#### Middle Ground
- Spread enemy attacks across party
- Focus fire on warriors (who can negate)
- Avoid instant-death traps
- Include NPC companions as shields
- Make death possible but not common

### Replacement Characters
1. **Pre-roll replacements** during session zero
2. **Same level** as deceased PC
3. **Quick integration** - common sources:
   - Ship crew members
   - Local bar contacts
   - Prisoners of current enemies
   - Fellow travelers
4. **Pre-established connections** to party

## Skill Checks

### When NOT to Roll
- Routine professional tasks
- Actions with obvious outcomes
- When failure has no consequences
- When PCs can just try again
- When players take clever direct action

### When TO Roll
- Uncertain outcomes
- Time pressure exists
- Failure has consequences
- Complicated attempts

### Best Practices
1. **Be charitable** - Let experts be expert
2. **Single rolls** for extended tasks
3. **Choices over rolls** - One check, then decisions
4. **Respect direct action** - Clever solutions work

### Example
**Bad**: "Roll Pilot every turn to keep flying"
**Good**: "Roll Pilot once. Success = smooth flight. Failure = rough flight in 1d6 rounds"

## Combat

### Core Principle
Combat should rarely be forced. PCs should fight because they choose to or because of their own mistakes.

### Making Combat Survivable
1. **Allow ambushes** and preparation
2. **Use environment** creatively
3. **Cover bonuses** are important
4. **Morale matters**:
   - Street thugs flee at 50% losses
   - Soldiers retreat when losing
   - Only fanatics fight to death

### Encouraging Smart Play
- Say yes to environmental tactics
- Reward planning and preparation
- Let PCs disengage when smart
- Make enemies act realistically

## Negotiation & Diplomacy

### Pure Dice Approach
- Roll Cha/Talk
- Words are just flavor
- Fair to all players
- Consistent with combat

### Hybrid Approach
- Player makes argument
- GM sets difficulty based on quality
- Good argument: Difficulty 8
- Poor argument: Difficulty 10
- Both player and character skill matter

### Skill-Based Consequences
- High bonus = better failure results
- Low bonus = worse success results
- Everyone rolls, outcomes vary

### Important: Declare approach during character creation!

## Searching & Investigation

### Core Rules
1. **Identify critical clues** before play
2. **Never hide vital info** behind dice
3. **Reward logical investigation**
4. **Multiple paths** to each clue
5. **Give info** when PCs provide excuse

### Dead End Solutions
- Helpful NPC appears
- Reminder of missed lead
- New event creates opening
- Let tardiness have consequences

### Search Methods

#### Quick Method
Everyone rolls Notice - fast but random

#### Detailed Method
Players describe specific searches - rewards thinking but can frustrate

#### Compromise
Automatic success for vital clues when "searching thoroughly", use other methods for bonuses

## Salvage & Trade

### Salvage Realities
- Most goods hard to move
- Legal ownership issues
- Need buyers for stolen goods
- Armor usually damaged beyond value
- Weapons need black market contacts

### Pricing
- **Legal quick sale**: 50% value
- **Patient legal sale**: 75-100% value
- **Fence**: 10-20% value
- **Off-world**: Better prices, transport costs

### Interstellar Trade
- **No bulk shipping** - ships too small
- **High-value only** - art, drugs, specialists
- **In-system runs** - regular income
- **Lost worlds** - high risk, high reward

### Common Cargoes
1. Local specialty tech/art
2. Expert passengers
3. Exotic pharmaceuticals
4. Supply runs to remote bases
5. Missionary supplies

## Quick Reference

### Difficulty Numbers
- **6**: Routine for skilled
- **8**: Professional task  
- **10**: Challenging
- **12**: Very difficult
- **14**: Near-impossible

### Morale Thresholds
- **Thugs**: Break at 50%
- **Guards**: Break at 75%
- **Soldiers**: Retreat when clearly losing
- **Fanatics**: Never retreat

### Search Results
- **Searching stated**: Find vital clues
- **Good description**: Find bonuses
- **Notice success**: Find hidden extras
- **Notice failure**: Miss optional benefits
