# Faction Overview

## What are Factions?
Factions are organized, motivated groups that serve as important actors in the sector. They can include interstellar merchant combines, tyrannical planetary empires, sinister cults, terrorist groups, or any organization important to the campaign.

## Purpose in the Game
The faction system provides:
- Constant stream of background activity
- Adventure hooks for player characters
- Visible setting reactions to PC actions
- News and events between sessions
- Formalized conflict resolution between groups

## Key Concepts

### When to Use Factions
- Groups important to the PCs
- Organizations that might hire or oppose PCs
- Major political, economic, or military powers
- Any group whose actions affect the campaign

### How Many Factions
- Start with 5-6 factions maximum
- Fewer than 3 tends to be too stable
- Add new factions as needed during play
- Remove inactive factions when focus shifts

## Using the Faction System

### As a News Generator
After each faction turn, create news reports about faction activities to share with players at session start.

### As Adventure Hooks
When players show interest in faction events, create adventures around their involvement.

### As Setting Reactions
Formalize how the world responds to PC actions by affecting faction assets and goals.

### Player Factions
PCs can eventually create their own factions, using the same rules but with the advantage of direct PC intervention.

## Important Notes

### Not a Standalone Game
- Requires GM involvement and judgment
- Not balanced for equivalence
- Some situations need GM arbitration
- Designed to produce useful GM output

### Flexibility
- Not all organizations need faction stats
- Can freeze distant factions when PCs move
- Switch active factions based on campaign focus
- Only stat groups that matter now

## Benefits Over Unstructured Systems

### Provides Surprises
- Unpredictable outcomes keep GM interested
- History is full of unlikely results
- Generates genuine shocking developments
- Creates unexpected adventure hooks

### Prompts Creative Thinking
- Forces consideration of faction interactions
- Avoids predictable assumptions
- Creates complex multi-faction conflicts
- Generates emergent storytelling
