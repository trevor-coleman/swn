## Strategic Considerations

### Difficulty vs. Reward

- Balance immediate needs with long-term goals

- Asset destruction weakens rivals
- Some goals naturally chain together

### Timing Goals
- Peaceable Kingdom during buildup
- Attack goals when assets ready
- Expansion after securing resources

## Custom Goals

GMs can create faction-specific goals:
- Retrieve pretech artifact (Difficulty 2-4)
- Establish trade monopoly (Difficulty = rival's Wealth)
- Convert planet to ideology (Difficulty 3)
- Survive rival assault (Difficulty 1-3)

### Creating Balanced Goals
1. Define clear completion criteria
2. Set difficulty based on effort required
3. Consider faction's capabilities
4. Ensure measurable progress

## Goal Completion Examples

**Requirement**: Force 3 faction must destroy 3 Force assets
1. Turn 1: Destroy militia unit (1/3)
2. Turn 3: Destroy guard unit (2/3)
3. Turn 4: Destroy mercenaries (3/3)
**Result**: 2 XP earned (½ of 3 rounded up)
