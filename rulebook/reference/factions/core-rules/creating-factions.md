# Creating Factions

How to build organizations that will shape your sector.

## Step-by-Step Creation

### 1. Concept and Nature
Decide what kind of organization this is:
- **Government**: Planetary rulers, system hegemons
- **Corporation**: Merchant combines, industrial giants
- **Criminal**: Syndicates, pirate confederations
- **Religious**: Churches, cults, philosophical movements
- **Military**: Mercenary companies, rebel groups
- **Other**: Research institutes, noble houses, guilds

### 2. Assign Attributes

#### Starting Ratings
Distribute 5 points among Force, Cunning, and Wealth
- Minimum 1 in each attribute
- Maximum 3 at creation
- Ratings define capability and asset limits

#### Attribute Guidelines
**Force**: Physical violence and military power
- 1: No military capability
- 2-3: Local militia or security
- 4-5: Professional military
- 6-7: Regional power
- 8: Sector hegemon

**Cunning**: Espionage and covert operations
- 1: Completely transparent
- 2-3: Basic security
- 4-5: Professional intelligence
- 6-7: Master manipulators
- 8: Illuminati-level secrecy

**Wealth**: Economic and industrial resources
- 1: Subsistence level
- 2-3: Local business
- 4-5: Planetary corporation
- 6-7: Interstellar combine
- 8: Sector-spanning empire

### 3. Calculate Derived Stats

#### Hit Points
```
Max HP = 4 + (Force XP cost) + (Cunning XP cost) + (Wealth XP cost)
```

Example: Force 2, Cunning 3, Wealth 1
- Max HP = 4 + 2 + 4 + 0 = 10

#### Starting FacCreds
```
Starting FacCreds = (Highest attribute) × 3
```

### 4. Choose Homeworld
- Must be an inhabited world
- Automatically has max HP Base of Influence
- Can buy assets without other bases
- Can be changed later (costs time)

### 5. Select Tags (1-2)

Common starting tags:
- **Deep Rooted**: +1 die on homeworld actions
- **Secretive**: Asset locations hidden from rivals
- **Imperialist**: -2 FacCred cost for Base of Influence
- **Planetary Government**: Special rules for control

### 6. Pick Starting Goal
Choose based on faction nature:
- Military factions: Military Conquest, Invincible Valor
- Economic factions: Commercial Expansion, Wealth of Worlds
- Spy agencies: Intelligence Coup, Inside Enemy Territory
- Expansionist: Expand Influence, Planetary Seizure

### 7. Buy Initial Assets
- Spend starting FacCreds on assets
- Must meet attribute requirements
- Consider planet tech levels
- Remember maintenance costs

## Example Faction Creation

### The Aurelius Consortium
**Concept**: Mining corporation seeking profit

**Attributes**:
- Force 1 (minimal security)
- Cunning 2 (corporate espionage)
- Wealth 3 (industrial power)

**Derived Stats**:
- Max HP: 4 + 0 + 2 + 4 = 10
- Starting FacCreds: 3 × 3 = 9

**Homeworld**: Aurelius (TL4 industrial world)

**Tags**: Plutocratic (Wealth assets cost -1 FacCred)

**Starting Goal**: Commercial Expansion

**Initial Assets**:
- Shipping Combine (4 FacCreds, Wealth 2)
- Marketers (2 FacCreds, Wealth 1)
- Informers (1 FacCred, Cunning 1)
- 2 FacCreds remaining

## Design Considerations

### Balance Priorities
- High single attribute vs. balanced approach
- Immediate power vs. growth potential
- Asset quantity vs. quality

### Tech Level Impact
- Higher TL worlds offer better assets
- Consider expansion possibilities
- Some assets need government permission

### Maintenance Planning
- Assets cost FacCreds to maintain
- Income = Wealth/2 + (Force+Cunning)/4
- Plan for sustainable operations

### Conflict Potential
- Design factions that will clash
- Create resource competition
- Build in personal grudges
- Leave hooks for PC involvement

## Common Faction Templates

### Planetary Government
- Force 3, Cunning 1, Wealth 2
- Tag: Planetary Government
- Goals: Maintain control, expand influence

### Crime Syndicate
- Force 2, Cunning 3, Wealth 1
- Tag: Secretive
- Goals: Intelligence coup, wealth accumulation

### Merchant House
- Force 1, Cunning 1, Wealth 4
- Tag: Plutocratic
- Goals: Commercial expansion, monopolies

### Rebel Movement
