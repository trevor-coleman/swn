# Faction Actions

## The Faction Turn
Faction actions are divided into turns, typically occurring:
- Once per month
- Once after each adventure
- Adjust frequency to campaign pace

## Turn Order
1. Roll die â‰¥ number of factions (d6 for 6 factions, d10 for 9, etc.)
2. Number rolled = first faction to act
3. Continue in order, wrapping around list

## Turn Income
At turn start, factions gain FacCreds:
- Half Wealth rating (rounded up)
- Plus 1/4 of (Force + Cunning) rounded down
- Must pay maintenance immediately
- Unmaintained assets become unusable

## Action Types
Factions take ONE action type per turn, but can perform it multiple times/locations.

### Attack
Launch strikes against rival assets.
- Only target known assets (not stealthed)
- Only attack same-world assets
- Each asset attacks once per turn
- Defenders can defend multiple times

**Resolution**:
1. Attacker rolls 1d10 + attribute (per Attack line)
2. Defender rolls 1d10 + targeted attribute
3. Success: Defender takes Attack damage
4. Failure: Attacker takes Counterattack damage
5. Tie: Both take damage

**Damage Options**:
- Apply to defending asset
- Redirect to Base of Influence (if present)
- 0 HP = asset/base destroyed

### Buy Asset

### Expand Influence

## Action Guidelines

### Multiple Targets
When taking an action type, can target multiple worlds/assets:
- Attack on three different worlds
- Buy assets on multiple planets (still one per world)
- Repair numerous damaged assets

### PC Interference
PC actions override faction turns:
- Direct PC intervention automatically succeeds
- No rolls needed for PC accomplishments
- Factions cannot resist PC actions during adventures

### News Generation
After each turn:
- Translate events to news/rumors
- Create 1-2 sentence summaries
- Share with players next session
- Use as adventure hooks

## Example Turn Sequence
1. Roll for initiative order
2. First faction:
   - Gains FacCreds (Wealth/2 + (Force+Cunning)/4)
   - Pays maintenance
   - Takes one action type
3. Next faction acts
4. Continue until all act
5. Generate news reports
