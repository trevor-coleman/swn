Organizations that shape the sector through intrigue, commerce, and warfare.

## Quick Start

- [Running Faction Turns](core-rules/faction-turns.md)
- [Common Actions](actions/)
- [Asset Reference](assets/)

## Core Concepts

### What Are Factions?
Factions are major organizations that act as background forces in your campaign:
- Governments, corporations, religions, criminal syndicates
- Generate news, adventure hooks, and setting changes
- React to PC actions on a larger scale
- Can be created and run by PCs

### Why Use Factions?
- **Dynamic World**: Events happen without PC involvement
- **Adventure Hooks**: Faction conflicts create opportunities
- **PC Investment**: Players care about faction allies/enemies
- **Surprise Results**: Dice create unexpected outcomes

## System Overview

### Faction Attributes
| Attribute | Description | Scale |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **Force** | Military might and violence | 1-8 |
| **Cunning** | Espionage and infiltration | 1-8 |
| **Wealth** | Economic and industrial power | 1-8 |
| **Hit Points** | Cohesion and morale | Variable |
| **FacCreds** | Resources for operations | Variable |
| **Experience** | Points for growth | Earned via goals |

### Faction Assets
- **Force Assets**: Military units, mercenaries, weapons
- **Cunning Assets**: Spies, hackers, blackmail networks
- **Wealth Assets**: Factories, shipping, research labs
- **Special**: Bases of Influence (required for expansion)

### Turn Sequence
1. Roll initiative (d6, d8, d10 based on faction count)
2. Gain income (Wealth/2 + (Force+Cunning)/4)
3. Pay maintenance costs
4. Take one action type (multiple uses allowed)
5. Resolve conflicts and consequences

## Quick Reference Tables

### Income Formula
```
FacCreds per turn = (Wealth/2 rounded up) + ((Force + Cunning)/4 rounded down)
```

### Experience Costs
| Rating | XP Cost | HP Value |
|--------|---------|----------|
| 1 | - | 1 |
| 2 | 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 4 | 4 |
| 4 | 6 | 6 |
| 5 | 9 | 9 |
| 6 | 12 | 12 |
| 7 | 16 | 16 |
| 8 | 20 | 20 |

### Asset Limits
- Maximum assets per type = Rating in that attribute
- Exceeding limit costs +1 FacCred maintenance per asset
- Bases of Influence don't count against limits

## GM Guidance

### Starting Factions
- Begin with 3-6 factions
- Mix different types (government, criminal, religious)
- Create natural conflicts and alliances
- Leave room for PC factions later

### Common Pitfalls
- Too many passive factions (add conflicts!)
- Forgetting PC actions override dice
- Over-detailed faction activities
- Not translating turns into news/rumors

### Integration with PCs
- PC actions can destroy/create assets outside turns
- Factions provide employment and opposition
- Let players care about faction outcomes
- PC factions get adventure advantage
