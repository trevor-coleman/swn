# Faction Creation

## Step 1: Define the Faction
Choose what type of organization this faction represents:
- Criminal syndicate
- Planetary government
- Religious organization
- Merchant combine
- Political movement
- Terrorist group
- Noble house
- Military organization
- Research collective

## Step 2: Set Attributes
Assign ratings to Force, Cunning, and Wealth (typically 1-3 for starting factions).

### Force
Military and security capabilities
- 1: Minimal security, no real military
- 2: Basic security forces
- 3: Professional military/security

### Cunning
Espionage and covert operations
- 1: Completely transparent
- 2: Basic counterintelligence
- 3: Active intelligence network

### Wealth
Economic and industrial power
- 1: Subsistence level
- 2: Moderate resources
- 3: Significant wealth

## Step 3: Calculate Derived Values

### Hit Points
Maximum HP = 4 + highest attribute's XP cost
- Attribute 1: +1 HP
- Attribute 2: +2 HP  
- Attribute 3: +4 HP
- And so on...

### Starting FacCreds
Varies by campaign, but typically:
- (Wealth × 3) + (Force + Cunning)
- Adjust based on faction concept

## Step 4: Choose Homeworld
Select the faction's base of operations:
- Must be a significant world
- Automatically has max HP Base of Influence
- Consider faction's nature when choosing

## Step 5: Select Tags
Choose 1-2 tags that reflect faction nature:
- Tags provide special abilities
- Should match faction concept
- See [Faction Tags](faction-tags.md) for options

## Step 6: Define Goals
Establish initial goal:
- Should match faction ideology
- Consider available resources
- Plan for achievable difficulty

## Step 7: Purchase Initial Assets
Buy starting assets:
- Limited by attribute ratings
- Must match homeworld tech level
- Consider faction strategy

## Example: The Starfall Syndicate

### Concept
Criminal organization specializing in smuggling and information brokering.

### Attributes
- Force: 1 (minimal muscle)
- Cunning: 3 (extensive spy network)
- Wealth: 2 (moderate resources)

### Derived Values
- Max HP: 4 + 4 = 8
- Starting FacCreds: (2 × 3) + (1 + 3) = 10

### Homeworld
Station Omega in the Rigel system

### Tags
- Secretive (bonus to stealth operations)
- Connected (reduced transport costs)

### Initial Goal
Intelligence Coup - Destroy 3 Cunning assets

### Starting Assets
- Base of Influence (8 HP) - Free on homeworld
- Informers (Cost 2)
- Smugglers (Cost 2)
- False Front (Cost 1)
- 5 FacCreds remaining

## New Faction Guidelines
