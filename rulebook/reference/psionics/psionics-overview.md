# Psionics Overview

Psionic powers first manifested centuries ago in the wake of the first interstellar flights. Later paraphysicists speculated that something about the exposure to metadimensional energies incurred in spike drive travel changed these spacers, altering genomes or warping their energy shadows in a way that changed their eventual offspring. While this theory was never completely proven, it was demonstrated that psionic powers were far more prevalent on the frontier, in people who were descended of starfaring ancestors, than they were on Old Terra. On most frontier worlds about one in ten thousand children are born with psychic aptitude, while Old Terra displayed only a tenth of that incidence.

## History of Psionics

### Metadimensional Extroversion Syndrome (MES)

Psychic abilities initially seemed to be a congenital curse, one known as "Metadimensional Extroversion Syndrome", or MES. Children manifested MES in puberty or early adulthood, after certain critical stages of brain development opened a channel between their minds and the churning maelstrom of energies that boiled in metadimensional space. By a conscious or unconscious act of will, they could release these energies in various forms. Even so, the passage of unmediated metadimensional force through unprotected neural tissue almost invariably caused brain damage. Repeated use of these abilities caused crippling disability, death, or madness. Most psychics were dead within a few years after manifesting. A few were able to control their powers sufficiently to prevent accidental discharges, but safe, controlled use of these abilities was unknown.

### The Psionic Authority

In response, the Terran Mandate initiated the Psionic Authority, basing it on a terraformed Mars. Children from throughout Mandate space were carefully selected by the Authority and brought to the institute in order to study and hopefully cure this tragic condition. Persistent legends speak of horrible experiments and ruthless sacrifices of "test subjects", but no proof of such evil ever emerged, and after decades of study, the Psionic Authority was actually able to produce protocols that allowed controlled, safe employment of psionic powers.

### The Scream and the Silence

The bloom of psitech development that followed and the wonders of jump gates and the Second Wave of human expansion are a matter of history. So too is the Scream that erupted six centuries ago and granted every living psychic in human space either violent madness or instant death. The interstellar societal collapse that followed and the centuries-long Silence between the stars has been a matter of living memory for many ill-connected frontier worlds.

With the Scream and the death or madness of every potential psychic tutor, psionics became the horror it once was generations ago. Untrained psychics suffer under the lash of their own abilities, doomed to early death if they aren't fortunate enough to fumble into a means of damping their own powers.

### Modern Psychics

In the past few centuries, however, a few worlds have managed to resuscitate the ancient psychic protocols and develop metapsionic tutors skilled enough to train new psychics. For some, it was the fruit of some discovered pretech wonder that damped psychic energies enough to safely experiment. For others, it was the product of coldly ruthless experimentation on disposable psychic test victims. A few worlds even retained some shreds of psychic mastery from the ancient days, the result of a Scream victim who was lucid enough to teach pupils, though usually for some demented or horrible end. Whatever the source, these institutions provide desperately-desired training for those few afflicted with MES.

## Psychic Academies

These "psychic academies" are scattered widely throughout the sectors of space, usually based out of some amenable planetary polity or defensible deep-space habitat. Some academies are exclusively for the use of a particular nation or planet, while others will accept anyone who can pay the tuition or satisfy the interests of their patrons. Most are powerful players in the local political scene, offering services that mean life and death to MES sufferers and producing graduates who are extremely useful to local rulers. Others need to operate in secret, avoiding the fearful attention of populations that neither accept nor trust their powers.

## Psychic Characters and Training

All Psychic PCs are assumed to have had some sort of training. They may have received their education at a world-famous psychic academy on their homeworld, or been taught in secret by a peripatetic psychic mentor, but only one in a million psychics has the blind luck and natural aptitude to develop an intuitive control of their MES. Of course, it may be that your PC was that one in a million, but you'll want to discuss it with your GM.

Psychic training requires from one to four years to complete, depending on the aptitude of the pupil and the amount of training support they get from other psychics. Most academies have one or more "deans" who actually have the metapsionic abilities to dampen and buffer novice minds. Regular application of their abilities to the pupils allows the students to safely practice and train with their powers until they've mastered the channeling of the energies.

## Attitudes Toward Psychics

Most worlds have a warily accepting attitude toward psionic abilities. Provided they've received appropriate training, a psychic can live and work in relative peace. They are not normally required to wear any sort of external badge or marking, and they are entitled to keep their own abilities private from anyone but the government if they so wish. They may be subject to mandatory "national service", depending on the polity, and their special abilities might be impressed by the government in cases of extreme need, but they are able to live a relatively normal, if very well-remunerated life. Ordinary men and women have only a vague understanding of psychic powers, but they understand enough to know the basic types of disciplines and the sort of effects each can produce.

Other worlds have a warmer attitude towards psychics. Those gifted with MES are elevated above the ordinary rabble, their abilities celebrated and directed toward the advantage of their communities. Such societies often have psychic ability as a prerequisite for substantial authority, and have worked precognitive visions or telepathic scans into the ordinary fabric of life.

A few worlds have outright hostility towards psychics and their abilities. MES sufferers might be viewed as pitiable victims of a lethal affliction they can't control, but trained and capable psychics are threats to be wiped out. Their telepathic probings, cheating foresight, and impossibly elusive teleportation makes them a menace to normal human beings, and society cannot tolerate their existence.

On almost all worlds, however, psychics can expect to suffer considerably harsher legal penalties than conventional criminals. Some worlds simply have no resources to jail an unwilling teleporter or mind-reading telepath, while others expect those of great gifts to have correspondingly great virtue. It's not unknown for psychics to face summary execution for crimes that would earn other malefactors a simple jail sentence.
