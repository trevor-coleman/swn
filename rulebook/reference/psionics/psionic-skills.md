# Psionic Skills

Psionic powers are divided up into disciplines, each of which has a corresponding skill. Someone with a basic, functioning expertise in the skill has level-0, while a true master of the art would have level-4. Only psychics can learn psionic skills, and they are most often taught at rigidly-disciplined psychic academies. Attempting to develop these skills without such formalized training is almost invariably lethal to the experimenter, though an exceedingly few natural prodigies sometimes intuitively grasp their principles. Even fewer of these gifted naturals are able to express their understanding in a coherent, teachable form.

## Psychic Types

### Unrestricted Psychics
Some psychics are "unrestricted". While they usually have a distinct aptitude for one or two disciplines, they can theoretically learn any of them, and may raise any psionic skill they choose. Any character with the **Psychic class** is an unrestricted psychic.

### Restricted Psychics
Others demonstrate gifts in only one discipline. While they can eventually master all aspects of that power, they can't raise any other psychic skill. Adventurers with the **Partial Psychic class option** are such "restricted" psychics.

## Untrained Psychics

Attempting to wield a natural psionic aptitude without proper precautions will almost inevitably cause death or madness, as the uncontrolled cascade of MES energies will cause varying forms of permanent brain damage. Untrained psychics can sometimes get away with using their powers very rarely, but these natural prodigies rarely have any ability beyond level-1 in a discipline. Those who use their powers often enough to gain more practical field experience can expect to end up dead, crippled, or insane.

## Available Disciplines

- **[Biopsionics](disciplines/biopsionics/)** - Healing and biological manipulation
- **[Metapsionics](disciplines/metapsionics/)** - Control of psychic energy itself
- **[Precognition](disciplines/precognition/)** - Sensing and influencing the future
- **[Telekinesis](disciplines/telekinesis/)** - Manipulation of physical forces
- **[Telepathy](disciplines/telepathy/)** - Mental contact and influence
- **[Teleportation](disciplines/teleportation/)** - Spatial translocation

## Training Requirements

Most psychic academies provide training in all common disciplines, though some may restrict certain techniques for political or ethical reasons. The metapsionic technique of psychic tutoring is particularly strictly controlled, as any pupil who has its rudiments included in their curriculum may eventually be able to train other psychics in turn.
