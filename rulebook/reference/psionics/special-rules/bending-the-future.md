# Bending the Future

Everything a precog sees is provisional. Some outcomes may be so likely as to be nigh-certain, but nothing is truly, absolutely destined. Vigorous activity or simple unexpected chance can skew future outcomes.

## The Paradox of Precognition

This effect is one reason why choirs of precogs have not been more widely exploited by planetary governments. The clearer and more detailed a future outcome becomes, the simpler it is to find the crucial events that can be changed to derail it. The more intense the precognitive focus toward a future event, the more fluid it becomes as fresh readings take into account the countermoves that others have made.

## Why Precognition Remains Uncertain

### Observer Effect
- Seeing the future changes it
- Knowledge of outcomes enables avoidance
- Multiple precogs create feedback loops
- Detailed visions reveal pivot points

### Cascade Effects
- Small changes ripple outward
- New decisions create new futures
- Free will trumps destiny
- Chaos theory applies

## Government Use of Precogs

### Why Precog Choirs Aren't Common:
1. **Self-Defeating**: The more precogs focus on an event, the more changeable it becomes
2. **Expensive**: Training and maintaining precogs is costly
3. **Unreliable**: Important events attract the most change
4. **Counterproductive**: Enemies can exploit known predictions

### Limited Applications:
- Natural disaster warnings
- Economic trend analysis
- Personal security for VIPs
- Military intelligence (with caveats)

## Pretech Solutions

Rumors persist of ancient pretech augmentation hardware that can "fix" future outcomes, but most governments lack the resources to even consider such extravagance.

### Legendary "Destiny Engines":
- Supposedly lock probability streams
- Prevent timeline alterations
- Make predictions absolute
- Probably mythical

## Practical Implications

### For Precogs:
- Vague visions often more reliable
- Specific details create vulnerabilities
- Multiple paths better than fixed outcomes
- Wisdom in when NOT to look

### For Those Opposing Precogs:
- Rapid decision changes confound predictions
- Random elements disrupt visions
- Multiple contingencies create uncertainty
- Last-minute alterations most effective

### For GMs:
- Predictions should be true at time of vision
- Player actions can change any future
- Vague prophecies harder to derail
- Specific visions reveal how to prevent them

## The Precog's Dilemma

Many precogs struggle with whether to share their visions:
- **Sharing** enables prevention but ensures change
- **Hiding** preserves accuracy but prevents preparation
- **Partial disclosure** balances both but satisfies neither

## Examples of Bending

### Personal Scale:
- Seeing your death in a specific location → Don't go there
- Vision of betrayal by ally → Take precautions or confront
- Foresee accident → Change route or timing

### Large Scale:
- Predict market crash → Investors pull out, changing outcome
- Foresee invasion → Military prepares, altering battle
- Vision of disaster → Evacuation changes casualty numbers
