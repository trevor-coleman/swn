# Telepathic Control Limitations

Telepathy is not a discipline well-suited to direct mental control of other beings. While a telepath can impart urges and thoughts to a target, they lack the tools to assume direct control of a victim's physical actions. The best they can do is implant ideas in the target's head and try to hijack the short-term cognition of the victim.

## What Telepathy CAN Do

### Influence Thoughts and Actions:
- **Suppress Cognition**: Make targets unable to think about specific things
- **Reflex Response**: Force sudden, irrational impulses
- **Memory Editing**: Alter or erase memories
- **Emotional Manipulation**: Through basic contact

### Information Gathering:
- Read surface thoughts
- Access memories
- Understand languages
- Detect emotions

## What Telepathy CANNOT Do

### Direct Physical Control:
- Cannot puppet a target's body
- Cannot override motor functions
- Cannot force specific physical actions
- Cannot speak through the target

### Limitations on Influence:
- Cannot force self-harm
- Cannot force harm to loved ones
- Physical danger breaks suppression
- Targets rationalize forced actions

## Legendary Lost Disciplines

Persistent legends speak of more direct disciplines practiced during the Mandate's heyday. These arts supposedly allowed a psychic to take direct control of a subject's physical form, manipulating it with effortless ease to perform whatever acts the psychic desired. 

### Rumored Abilities:
- Direct motor control
- Physical puppeteering
- Forced speech
- Complete body takeover

### Key Differences:
- Could control physical actions
- Could NOT read thoughts
- Could NOT access memories
- Purely somatic control

If any such disciplines ever existed, their possessors are doubtless very discreet with them.

## Game Balance Considerations

The limitation on direct control is intentional for several reasons:
1. **Player Agency**: Prevents removal of player control
2. **Drama**: Influence creates more interesting scenarios than puppetry
3. **Counterplay**: Targets can resist and work around influence
4. **Ethics**: Makes telepathy morally complex rather than simply evil

## Working Within Limitations

Skilled telepaths can achieve remarkable results despite these limitations:

### Combining Techniques:
- Suppress Cognition + Reflex Response for complex manipulations
- Memory Editing to cover tracks
- Unity of Thought for willing coordination

### Creative Applications:
- Make guards "forget" to check areas
- Cause enemies to make tactical errors
- Implant false memories of orders
- Create confusion in combat
