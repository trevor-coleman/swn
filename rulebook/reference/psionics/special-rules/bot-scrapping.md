# Bot Scrapping

While telekinetic powers can't normally be used to harm an intelligent target without a special technique, non-sentient robots have no such protection. A VI or True AI can create enough metadimensional static with their cognition to prevent harm from telekinesis, but ordinary guard bots, servitor droids, or warbots are extremely susceptible to telekinetic destruction.

## How It Works

In most cases, this is as simple a matter as telekinetically lifting and then dropping the bot. A psychic can destroy as many such bots in a round as they can telekinetically manipulate; one for most, or three or four at higher skill levels. This also assumes the psychic can lift the bot's weight.

## Resilient Military Bots

Some military bots may be resilient enough to handle this battering, suffering **1d10 damage per level of Telekinesis skill** the psychic possesses. Most have no such chance of survival.

## Important Distinctions

### Vulnerable to Bot Scrapping:
- Guard bots
- Servitor droids
- Warbots
- Simple automated systems
- Non-sentient security systems

### Protected from Bot Scrapping:
- VIs (Virtual Intelligences)
- True AIs
- Any robot with sentient-level cognition
- Cyborgs with human consciousness
- Telepresence-controlled robots (while controlled)

## Tactical Implications

This rule makes telekinetics extremely dangerous to automated defenses. Facilities relying heavily on robotic security may need to either:
- Employ VI or True AI controlled units
- Mix human and robotic security
- Use telekinesis-dampening technology
- Design bots too heavy for typical telekinetics
