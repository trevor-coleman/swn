# Telekinesis Overview

Telekinesis is the psychic discipline of moving matter with mental force alone. Among the most visually impressive of psychic powers, it offers both combat applications and utility unmatched by other disciplines.

## Nature of Telekinesis

### How It Works
Telekinetic powers project invisible force from the psychic's mind, manipulating objects at a distance. This force originates from metadimensional energy channeled through focused will.

### Characteristics
- **Invisible Force**: Usually unseen, though can be made visible as a glow
- **Source Concealment**: Origin point not obvious to observers
- **Range**: Line of sight or touch
- **Precision**: Less fine control than hands, more like invisible limbs

### Limitations
- **Worn Items**: Cannot affect objects worn or held by living beings
- **Living Targets**: Cannot directly manipulate unwilling creatures
- **Self-Lifting**: Cannot levitate self without special techniques
- **Machines**: Can affect robots and devices as inanimate objects

## Social Perception

### Advantages
- Among the least feared psychic powers
- Visually impressive but understandable
- Practical applications obvious
- Less invasive than telepathy

### Challenges
- Less commercially valuable than biopsionics
- Limited demand compared to other disciplines
- Requires creativity to maximize value
- Potential for property damage

### Daily Use
- Labor replacement
- Delicate operations
- Multi-tasking
- Convenience applications

## Training Telekinesis

### Early Signs
- Objects moving during emotional states
- Unconscious levitation while sleeping
- Poltergeist-like activity
- Stress-triggered manifestations

### Development Path
1. **Control**: Conscious activation vs emotional
2. **Strength**: Building lifting capacity
3. **Precision**: Fine motor equivalent
4. **Endurance**: Sustained effects
5. **Complexity**: Multiple simultaneous tasks

### Common Exercises
- Weight progression training
- Precision manipulation drills
- Multi-object juggling
- Force shaping practice
- Combat application scenarios

## Living with Telekinesis

### Daily Advantages
- Never need to get up for remote
- Hands-free operation
- Carry more than normal
- Reach inaccessible places

### Social Considerations
- Property damage concerns
- Accusations of cheating
- Privacy issues
- Insurance complications

### Physical Health
- No muscle atrophy (mental exercise)
- Reduced physical strain
- Potential for laziness
- Energy expenditure

## Advanced Concepts

### Force Constructs
Creating semi-permanent objects from pure telekinetic energy - weapons, armor, tools.

### Molecular Manipulation
Using TK at microscopic scales for heating, cooling, or chemical changes.

### Environmental Shaping
Large-scale manipulation of battlefield conditions, weather patterns, or terrain.

### Telekinetic Flight
Advanced techniques for self-levitation and aerial maneuvering.

## Common Misconceptions

### "TK is Just Throwing Things"
- Complex applications possible
- Precision work valuable
- Environmental control powerful
- Defensive uses crucial

### "Strength Equals Skill"
- Precision often more important
- Creativity beats raw power
- Control determines effectiveness
- Endurance matters

### "TK Can Do Anything"
- Cannot affect living beings directly
- Range limitations exist
- Precision has limits
- Power costs Effort

## Telekinetic Ethics

### Property Damage
- Responsibility for TK actions
- Insurance implications
- Collateral damage
- Training requirements

### Privacy Concerns
- Remote manipulation issues
- Locked door irrelevance
- Surveillance possibilities
- Legal boundaries

### Combat Ethics
- Lethal force implications
- Restraint techniques
- Proportional response
- Non-combatant safety
