# Telekinetic Techniques

All telekinetic powers organized by level. Each psychic begins with the core technique and gains additional techniques as they advance.

## Core Technique: Telekinetic Manipulation

The adept may Commit Effort for the scene as a Main Action to direct telekinetic force toward an object or person within unaided visual range or with tactile contact with the psychic. This force isn't responsive enough to be effective as a weapon without further refinement of technique, and cannot cause damage to living or mobile targets. If used to crush or harm immobile unliving objects, it does 1d6 damage per skill level of the psychic per round of focus. Objects move at 20 meters per round when moved telekinetically.

A telekinetic force can be maintained over multiple rounds without expending further actions, such as holding a metal platform in place under a group of allies, but the psychic cannot again activate this technique on a second object until they release the first.

## Common Questions

### Can I throw living beings?
No, living creatures cannot be directly manipulated unless they're willing or unconscious.

### Can TK be detected?
The force itself is invisible unless you choose to make it glow. The effects are obvious but the source isn't.

### How precise is Telekinetic Manipulation?
Less precise than hands - think of it like wearing thick gloves or using tools.

### Can I fly by lifting my clothes?
No, worn items are considered part of the living being. You need Singular Gravity Mastery.
