# Teleportation Techniques

All teleportation powers organized by level. Mastery of space itself begins with personal movement and extends to transporting others and manipulating spatial relationships.

## Core Technique: Personal Apportation

The teleporter can translocate to another location they have either occupied before or can see with their unaided vision. Locations are fixed in reference to the nearest major gravity well. For example, it is not possible to teleport to the cockpit of a distant moving vehicle they once occupied, but they can teleport to another point on a planet's surface even though the planet has since moved far through the stellar void.

The core technique allows the teleporter to move himself and any mass he is able to carry with his own natural strength. Resisting targets cannot be carried along, and unresisting ones must be touched. A teleporter can leave any clothing, shackles, adhesions, or other matter behind when he teleports, but he cannot leave behind matter that has been inserted into his body, such as cybernetics or shrapnel. Matter cannot be partially left behind.

A teleporter will instinctively abort any apportation that would leave him embedded in a solid object or in an environment of imminent physical harm. Any Committed Effort on such aborted jumps is wasted, as is any action spent triggering the power.

### Base Requirements

## Level-1 Techniques

### Proficient Apportation

- **Effect**: 360-degree awareness to 100 meters
- **Perception**: Like sight but no colors/text
- **Obstacles**: Blocked by solid objects
- **Advantages**: Unaffected by darkness, illusions
- **Usage**: Never be surprised, perfect positioning

## Level-2 Techniques

### Burdened Apportation
- **Effect**: Carry willing companions when teleporting
- **Capacity**: 3 human-sized beings per Teleportation level
- **Range**: Allies within 3 meters
- **Mass Limit**: 200kg of objects per skill level
- **Cost**: Additional Effort for the day
- **Usage**: Team extraction, cargo transport

### Perceptive Dislocation
- **Action**: Main Action
- **Effort**: Commit for the day
- **Effect**: Sense any location you could teleport to
- **Duration**: 15 minutes maximum
- **Perception**: As if physically present
- **Usage**: Scouting, surveillance, planning

### Spatial Synchrony Mandala
- **Action**: Main Action
- **Effort**: Standard for imprinting
- **Effect**: Imprint object/person for tracking
- **Requirements**: 1 hour meditation, willing if person
- **Tracking**: Always know location if in teleport range
- **Arrival**: Within 3 meters of target
- **Limits**: One imprint at a time, 1kg minimum mass
- **Usage**: Never lose important items/people

## Level-3 Techniques

### Effortless Apportation
- **Effect**: Personal Apportation needs no Effort
- **Exception**: Augments still cost their normal Effort
- **Benefit**: Unlimited short-range teleportation
- **Usage**: Continuous mobility without fatigue

### Rift Reduplication
- **Action**: Instant
- **Effort**: Commit additional Effort for the day
- **Effect**: Use Personal Apportation as On Turn action
- **Limit**: Once per round maximum
- **Tactic**: Teleport in, act, teleport out
- **Counter**: Only held actions can respond
- **Usage**: Hit-and-run attacks, impossible escapes

### Stutterjump
- **Action**: On Turn to activate
- **Effort**: Commit while active
- **Effect**: Base AC 20 from micro-teleports
- **Modifiers**: No Dex/armor/shield bonuses
- **Special**: Once per day, Instant Effort to negate hit
- **Escape**: Leaves you outside area attacks
- **Usage**: Ultimate defense against attacks

## Level-4 Techniques

### Deep Intrusion
- **Effect**: Blind teleport into structures
- **Targets**: Buildings, vehicles, visible spaceships
- **Placement**: Random safe location inside
- **Safety**: Avoids immediate hazards
- **Cost**: Additional Effort for the day
- **Usage**: Infiltration without entry points

### Offensive Apportation
- **Action**: Main Action
- **Requirement**: Physical contact with target
- **Attack**: Punch roll + Teleportation skill
- **Effect**: Teleport unwilling target
- **Options**: Go with them using Burdened Apportation
- **Limits**: Same as personal range/safety
- **Save**: None if contact successful
- **Usage**: Remove enemies, kidnapping

## Safety Mechanisms

### Automatic Protections
- Cannot teleport into solid matter
- Abort if destination dangerous
- Shunted to nearest safe space
- Instinctive hazard detection

### Momentum Conservation
- Velocity unchanged by teleport
- Falling before = falling after
- Can change facing, not speed
- Plan landings carefully

### Failure Modes
- Effort wasted on aborted jumps
- Action lost if blocked
- Strain from forced shunting
- Disorientation possible

## Advanced Tactics

### Combat Teleportation
1. **Hit and Run**: Rift Reduplication for double jumps
2. **Defensive**: Stutterjump for AC 20
3. **Positioning**: Height advantage, flanking
4. **Escape**: Always have exit planned

### Infiltration
1. **Reconnaissance**: Perceptive Dislocation first
2. **Entry**: Deep Intrusion for blind access
3. **Extraction**: Burdened Apportation for team
4. **Tracking**: Spatial Synchrony on objectives

### Support
1. **Rescue**: Burdened Apportation for wounded
2. **Supply**: Cargo transportation
3. **Communication**: Physical courier
4. **Scouting**: Risk-free exploration

## Training Progressions

### Mobility Specialist
1. Proficient Apportation for speed
2. Spatial Awareness for safety
3. Effortless Apportation for endurance
4. Stutterjump for defense

### Team Operator
1. Burdened Apportation for groups
2. Spatial Synchrony for coordination
3. Rift Reduplication for tactics
4. Deep Intrusion for insertion

### Scout/Infiltrator
1. Spatial Awareness for detection
2. Perceptive Dislocation for intel
3. Deep Intrusion for access
4. Offensive Apportation for extraction

## Common Combinations

### The Untouchable
- Stutterjump + Effortless Apportation
- Nearly impossible to hit
- Constant repositioning
- Extreme Effort cost

### The Kidnapper
- Offensive Apportation + Burdened Apportation
- Touch enemy, teleport with them
- Deliver to prepared location
- Requires setup

### The Ghost
- Deep Intrusion + Perceptive Dislocation
- Scout then infiltrate
- No trace entry
- Information gathering

## Limitations and Counters

### Range Restrictions
- Must see or have been there
- Gravity well relative
- No moving vehicles
- Distance by skill level

### Blocking Methods
- Metadimensional interference (rare)
- Physical barriers still matter
- Can't teleport if can't concentrate
- Grappling prevents escape

### Legal/Social
- Highly regulated on most worlds
- Severe penalties for crimes
- Tracking implants common
- Safe zones for VIPs

## Common Questions

### Can I teleport others against their will?
Not without Level-4 Offensive Apportation and physical contact.

### What if my destination moves?
Locations are relative to gravity wells, not objects. That moving car is gone.

### Can I teleport through shields/barriers?
Yes, unless they specifically block teleportation (very rare pretech).

### Do I keep my speed when teleporting?
Yes, momentum is conserved. Plan your landing.

### Can I partially teleport?
No, it's all or nothing. You can leave worn items behind but not body parts.
