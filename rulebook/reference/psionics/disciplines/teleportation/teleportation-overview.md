# Teleportation Overview

Teleportation represents the ultimate expression of freedom of movement - the ability to instantly transport matter across space through metadimensional shortcuts. This discipline offers unparalleled mobility at the cost of significant mental strain.

## Nature of Teleportation

### How It Works
Teleportation creates temporary rifts in metadimensional space, allowing near-instantaneous travel between two points in real space. The psychic essentially "folds" space to bring two locations together.

### Physical Principles
- **Conservation**: Momentum and energy are conserved
- **Displacement**: Air/water displaced at both ends
- **Accuracy**: Precision improves with skill
- **Safety**: Cannot materialize in solid matter
- **Orientation**: Can change facing but not velocity

### Limitations
- **Line of Sight**: Most techniques require visual targeting
- **Mass Limits**: Can only transport so much
- **Mental Strain**: Heavy Effort costs
- **No Telefrags**: Cannot teleport into occupied space
- **Range Limits**: Distance restricted by skill level

## Social Perception

### Public Reaction
- Generally fascinating rather than frightening
- Seen as useful rather than invasive
- Some security concerns
- Less regulated than telepathy
- Valuable for many professions

### Security Implications
- Traditional barriers meaningless
- Requires special countermeasures
- Valuable for infiltration
- Emergency escape tool
- Customs/border concerns

## Training Teleportation

### Early Signs
- Unconscious position shifts
- "Appearing" suddenly
- Getting lost impossibly
- Spatial disorientation

### Development Path
1. **Anchoring**: Maintaining position
2. **Targeting**: Accurate arrival
3. **Capacity**: Increasing cargo
4. **Range**: Extending distance
5. **Precision**: Perfect placement

### Safety Training
- Never jump blind
- Check arrival zones
- Maintain orientation
- Manage momentum
- Emergency protocols

### Common Exercises
- Line of sight hopping
- Measured distance jumps
- Weight progression
- Accuracy drills
- Emergency scenarios

## Living with Teleportation

### Daily Benefits
- No commute time
- Instant shopping
- Perfect punctuality
- Easy travel

### Social Challenges
- Privacy concerns
- Relationship dynamics
- Security suspicions
- Legal gray areas

### Physical Considerations
- Spatial awareness critical
- Disorientation management
- Effort fatigue
- Nutritional needs

## Advanced Concepts

### Metadimensional Theory
Understanding the space "between" spaces and how teleportation actually works at a theoretical level.

### Anchor Points
Creating semi-permanent teleportation destinations for repeated accurate jumps.

### Spatial Folding
Advanced techniques for bringing space to you rather than moving through it.

### Quantum Positioning
Perfect accuracy through quantum-level position awareness and control.

## Common Misconceptions

### "Teleporters Can Go Anywhere"
- Line of sight usually required
- Range limitations exist
- Can't penetrate all barriers
- Familiarity helps accuracy

### "It's Just Disappearing"
- Complex spatial mathematics
- Significant energy expenditure
- Precise control needed
- Not simple vanishing

### "Perfect Escape Tool"
- Requires concentration
- Uses significant Effort
- Can be countered
- Not always instant

## Teleportation Safety

### Collision Avoidance
- Automatic shunting from solids
- Painful but not lethal
- May emerge displaced
- Disorientation common

### Momentum Management
- Speed carries through
- Falls still dangerous
- Vehicle jumps risky
- Orientation control critical

### Environmental Hazards
- Vacuum transitions
- Pressure differences
- Temperature shocks
- Atmospheric changes

## Teleportation Ethics

### Privacy Invasion
- Entering private spaces
- Bypassing security
- Voyeurism potential
- Trespassing laws

### Economic Disruption
- Transport industry impact
- Border control issues
- Customs violations
- Trade implications

### Military Concerns
- Assassination potential
- Defense complications
- Arms race dynamics
- Treaty considerations

## Common Questions

### Can I teleport others against their will?
Generally no - unwilling targets can't be directly teleported without special techniques.

### What happens if I teleport into a wall?
You're shunted to the nearest open space, taking strain but avoiding death.

### Can I change my velocity?
No - momentum is conserved. Falling before means falling after.

### Is there a "between" space?
You experience no time passage, but theoretically pass through metadimensional space.
