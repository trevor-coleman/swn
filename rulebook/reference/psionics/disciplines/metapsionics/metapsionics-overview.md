# Metapsionics

Metapsionics is the rarest and most esoteric of the psychic disciplines, with few psychics having the necessary temperament or interest in developing these complex abilities. A metapsion controls psychic energy itself, molding and shaping the flows of energy that spill through the brains of those marked by MES.

Taken in isolation, metapsionics allows a psychic to increase the raw Effort available to them and become more flexible in how this Effort is used. Expert metapsions can even teach other potential psychics how to control and channel their new abilities, and the services of a trained psychic mentor command considerable sums in most systems.

Beyond this, in most stellar sectors a competent metapsion is the only practical way to protect a target from undetectable psychic assault. Without a vigilant brainguard, a head of state, interstellar celebrity, or planetary oligarch might find their minds rifled effortlessly by some undetected psychic intruder.

As a consequence, many metapsions become much more physically competent and better-trained in combat than the average psychic. The high prices they can command as brainguards attract some, though others find their clients too aggravating to endure for long.

## Core Technique: Psychic Refinement

The metapsion gains improved mastery over their own powers and an innate sensitivity to the use of psionic abilities in their presence.

### Skill Progression

- **Level-0**: The adept can visually and audibly detect the use of psychic powers. If both the source and target are visible to the metapsion, they can tell who's using the power, even if it's normally imperceptible. They gain a +2 bonus on any saving throw versus a psionic power.

- **Level-1**: The metapsion's maximum Effort increases by an additional point.

- **Level-2**: The adept can determine whether or not a person is a psychic or has latent psionic abilities through one round of visual inspection. Their saving throw bonus against psionic powers increases to +3.

- **Level-3**: The metapsion's maximum Effort increases by an additional point.

- **Level-4**: The metapsion can perform a slightly safer version of torching. Instead of rolling the torching damage die, they simply suffer 10 hit points of damage after torching is used. The damage occurs after the fueled power activates, allowing a psychic at low hit points to trigger a power before falling unconscious. This damage cannot be healed by anything but natural bed rest, though a psychic can be stabilized if this technique drops her to zero hit points.

## Metapsionics as Brainguarding

Metapsions are highly valued as "brainguards" - personal bodyguards against psychic intrusion. A skilled metapsion can:
- Detect any use of psychic powers near their client
- Identify the source of psychic attacks
- Use techniques like Psychic Static to shut down hostile powers
- Create protective barriers against specific disciplines

This makes them invaluable to political leaders, wealthy merchants, and anyone else who fears psychic manipulation.
