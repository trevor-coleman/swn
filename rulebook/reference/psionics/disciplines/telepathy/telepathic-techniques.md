# Telepathic Techniques

All telepathic powers organized by level. The foundation of all telepathy is establishing mental contact, upon which all other techniques build.

## Core Technique: Telepathic Contact

The telepath can obtain a progressively-deeper understanding of a sentient target's thoughts. The target must be visible or otherwise perceptible to the telepath's unaided senses. Opening a contact requires the telepath to Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action, and the contact lasts for a scene at most unless augmented by other techniques.

The depth of contact that can be made depends on the psychic's Telepathy skill. A single contact can use any or all of the effects permitted to a telepath of the user's skill level. Basic forms of contact do not allow for a saving throw, though more advanced probes allow the target to make a Mental saving throw to resist. On a successful save, no form of this technique that allows a save can be used on them for the rest of the scene.

### Progression by Level
- **Level-0**: Observe emotional states in a target. Intense emotions provide a single word or image related to the focus of the feelings
- **Level-1**: A shallow gestalt with the target's language centers allows understanding any communication and speaking their language if physically capable
- **Level-2**: Read current surface thoughts (not memories or non-obvious connections). Target gets Mental save to resist
- **Level-3**: Drill into memory for one or two-sentence answer to any question or single memory vision. Mental save to resist, contact ends either way
- **Level-4**: Full awareness of everything target remembers about a topic. Mental save to resist, contact ends either way
