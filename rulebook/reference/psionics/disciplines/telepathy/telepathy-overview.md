# Telepathy Overview

Telepathy is the most controversial and feared of the psychic disciplines. The ability to read minds, project thoughts, and manipulate mental states strikes at the heart of personal privacy and autonomy.

## Nature of Telepathy

### How It Works
Telepathic powers create direct mind-to-mind connections through metadimensional channels. These links allow the flow of thoughts, emotions, memories, and even direct mental control.

### Requirements
- **Conscious Minds**: Target must be awake and aware
- **Intelligence**: Only works on sapient beings
- **Organic**: Usually limited to biological minds
- **Range**: Line of sight or established connection

All telepathic techniques require establishing mental contact first. This fundamental connection serves as the conduit for all other powers.
