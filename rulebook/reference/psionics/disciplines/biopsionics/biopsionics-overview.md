# Biopsionics

Biopsionic powers repair, augment, debilitate, or damage living creatures. Unless otherwise specified the biopsionicist must be able to touch a target, though clothing and armor do not interfere with the use of these abilities. Touching a willing or unsuspecting target is automatic, whereas touching a resisting target requires a normal Punch hit roll with a bonus equal to the practitioner's Biopsionics skill. Such touch effects do not inflict the normal damage of a Punch attack.

Unsurprisingly, biopsionic powers are among the most accepted psychic abilities. Even a modestly-experienced biopsion can perform miracles of healing for a community lucky enough to have their services.

## Core Technique: Psychic Succor

The adept's touch stabilizes critically-wounded organisms. More sophisticated practitioners can heal tissue injuries, though curing diseases, detoxifying poisons, and fixing congenital deformities require additional techniques. Each use of Psychic Succor adds one point of System Strain to the target, or two points if they were mortally wounded at the time.

Activating Psychic Succor requires the biopsion to Commit Effort for the day. Once used, they can continue to use it for the rest of that scene without Committing Effort again.

### Skill Progression

- **Level-0**: The psychic's touch can automatically stabilize a mortally-wounded target as a Main Action. This power must be used on a target within six rounds of their collapse, and does not function on targets that have been decapitated or killed by Heavy weapons. It's the GM's decision as to whether a target is intact enough for this power to work.

- **Level-1**: As level-0, and heal 1d6+1 hit points of damage. If used on a mortally-wounded target, they revive with the rolled hit points and can act normally on the next round.

- **Level-2**: As level-1, but healing 2d6+2 hit points instead.

- **Level-3**: As level-2, but healing 2d6+6 hit points instead.

- **Level-4**: As level-3, but healing 3d6+8 hit points instead.

## System Strain

Many curative biopsionic powers add to the target's System Strain. System Strain is a measure of the amount of system stress, intrusive modification, and general biological distress an organism might be suffering. If using a power on a target would make their System Strain exceed their Constitution score, the effect fails to function; their body simply cannot adapt to the changes. System Strain decreases automatically by one point after each night of rest, provided the organism is well-fed and not compromised.

## Biopsionics and Hospitals

Biopsionics is a spectacularly effective discipline for curing physical injuries and sicknesses, but its use for the latter is capped by the biopsion's available Effort. Hospitals on worlds with access to psychic academies often have several biopsions on staff, proficient with the requisite techniques and capable of quickly healing tremendous amounts of trauma injuries on short notice.

Assuming one proficient and available biopsion for every 100,000 citizens, however, the total amount of sickness-curing ability is going to be very limited, and likely reserved for the powerful and wealthy. The vanishingly few psychics who are master metapsions capable of the Flawless Mastery of Organic Purification Protocols can easily command as much as two thousand credits a day just for temporary work at a grateful hospital.

Ordinary PC biopsions who want to pick up some extra work curing sicknesses can usually find temp employment with a local medical facility for 50 credits per day per Effort point they have. Note that some patients may be very upset if the hospital fails to assign them the PC's limited Effort.
