# Precognition Overview

Precognition is the psychic discipline of perceiving future events and manipulating probability. Precogs are simultaneously blessed with foresight and cursed with the knowledge of what's to come.

## Nature of Precognition

### How It Works
Precognitive powers tap into the probability streams of metadimensional space, allowing the psychic to perceive likely futures. This isn't perfect prophecy - it's reading the most probable outcomes based on current trajectories.

### Limitations
- **Other Precogs**: Future sight becomes cloudy when other precogs are involved
- **Free Will**: Sentient choices can alter predicted outcomes  
- **Temporal Distance**: The further ahead, the less certain
- **Active vs Passive**: Some powers require conscious activation, others trigger automatically

## Social Perception

### Advantages
- Precogs are often sought as advisors
- Military and corporate value for strategic planning
- Generally less feared than other psychics
- Useful for gambling (where not banned)

### Challenges  
- Burden of knowledge about future tragedies
- Difficulty forming relationships when you know outcomes
- Legal restrictions in some jurisdictions
- Accusations of market manipulation
