# Precognitive Techniques

All precognitive powers organized by level. Each psychic begins with the core technique and gains additional techniques as they advance.

## Core Technique: Oracle

The precog gains a progressively-greater intuitive understanding of their own future. Each invocation of the Oracle technique requires a Main Action and that the user Commit Effort for the day. The adept then gains an intuitive understanding of the outcome of any activity they are about to undertake in the next time period. This understanding is roughly equivalent to seeing the outcome provided the precog participates in the activity and does not use any further precognitive abilities.

### Progression by Level
- **Level-0**: One minute into the future
- **Level-1**: One day into the future
- **Level-2**: One week into the future
- **Level-3**: Three months into the future
- **Level-4**: One year into the future

The Oracle technique is the heart of precognition, granting visions of personal futures that grow clearer and more distant with skill.

## Level-1 Techniques

### Intuitive Response
- **Action**: Instant (before rolling initiative)
- **Effort**: Commit for the scene
- **Effect**: Your initiative score is treated as one better than anyone else's in the scene
- **Limitations**: Cannot be used if surprised; ties with similar abilities roll normally
- **Usage**: Perfect for always acting first in combat

### Sense the Need
- **Action**: Instant
- **Effort**: Commit for the day
- **Effect**: Retroactively declare you brought one reasonably obtainable object
- **Limitations**: Must be plausible given recent events (no laser pistol after weapon check)
- **Usage**: "I had a feeling I'd need this rope/medkit/keycard..."

### Terminal Reflection
- **Action**: Instant (automatic trigger)
- **Effort**: Commit for the day (or technique disabled)
- **Effect**: Oracle automatically warns of unexpected danger, negating surprise
- **Benefits**: Affects precog and companions
- **Usage**: Never be ambushed again

## Level-2 Techniques

### Alternate Outcome
- **Action**: Instant
- **Effort**: Commit for the day
- **Effect**: Target ally or self rerolls failed hit roll, save, or skill check
- **Limitations**: Once per target per day; disrupts probability lines
- **Usage**: Turn critical failures into potential successes

### Destiny's Shield
- **Action**: Instant
- **Effort**: Commit for the day
- **Effect**: Force attacker to reroll successful hit against you
- **Risk**: If reroll still hits, damage is maximized
- **Limitations**: Personal attacks only; once per attack
- **Usage**: Last-ditch defense against devastating hits

## Level-3 Techniques

### Anguished Vision
- **Action**: Instant
- **Effort**: Commit for the day
- **Effect**: Experience the next 6 seconds of future, then time rewinds
- **Scope**: Full combat round or 6 seconds out of combat
- **Limitations**: Once per day only
- **Usage**: Perfect do-over for catastrophic situations

### Cursed Luck
- **Action**: Main Action
- **Effort**: Commit for the scene
- **Effect**: Target rolls twice and takes worse result on all rolls
- **Benefits**: Attackers against target roll twice and take better result
- **Save**: Mental save at end of each round (not penalized)
- **Usage**: Devastating debuff on powerful enemies

### Forced Outcome
- **Action**: Main Action
- **Effort**: Commit for the scene
- **Effect**: Control random mechanical outcomes; cause plausible coincidences
- **Examples**: Control roulette wheel, card shuffle, convenient equipment failures
- **Limitations**: No human involvement; GM judges plausibility
- **Usage**: Rig games of chance, create "lucky" accidents

## Level-4 Techniques

### Not My Time
- **Action**: None (automatic trigger)
- **Effort**: Commit for the day
- **Effect**: When about to die, random events conspire to keep you alive
- **Duration**: Safety for a few minutes
- **Limitations**: Once per week; may not survive intact
- **Usage**: Ultimate survival insurance

### Prophecy
- **Action**: Main Action
- **Effort**: Commit until fulfilled
- **Effect**: Make one prediction about your future within a year that will come true

## Common Questions

### Can I predict other precogs?
The future becomes cloudy when other precogs are involved. Their probability manipulation interferes with clear visions.

### How specific are Oracle visions?
They show likely outcomes, not exact details. The psychic gets an intuitive sense of success/failure and general results.

### Can Prophecy be used for others?
Only if their future directly involves yours. "I will save the president" works; "The president will be safe" doesn't.

### Does Anguished Vision erase damage taken?
Yes, time literally rewinds. Nothing from that round actually happened yet.
