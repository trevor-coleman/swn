# System Strain

Many curative biopsionic powers add to the target's System Strain. System Strain is a measure of the amount of system stress, intrusive modification, and general biological distress an organism might be suffering. Psionic healing, cybernetic implants, and powerful drugs all add to a target's System Strain.

## System Strain Limit

If using a power or drug on a target would make their System Strain exceed their **Constitution score**, the effect fails to function; their body simply cannot adapt to the changes and cannot benefit from them.

## Recovery

System Strain decreases automatically by **one point** after each night of rest, provided the organism is well-fed and not compromised by sickness or privation.

## Sources of System Strain

### Biopsionics
- **Psychic Succor**: Adds 1 point of System Strain to the target, or 2 points if they were mortally wounded at the time
- **Holistic Optimization Patterning**: Adds 2 points of System Strain
- **Metamorph**: Adds 1 point that doesn't recover while the change is in effect

### Other Sources
- Cybernetic implants (varies by implant)
- Powerful drugs and stimulants
- Certain medical procedures

## Managing System Strain

System Strain creates a natural limit on how much biological enhancement or healing a character can receive in a short period. This prevents abuse of healing powers or stacking of multiple enhancements, while still allowing characters to benefit from these abilities over time.
