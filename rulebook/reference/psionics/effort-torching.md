# Effort and Torching

## Effort

Psionic powers are fueled by **Effort**, a measure of the psychic's mental focus, energy, and neural responsiveness. 

### Maximum Effort

A psychic's maximum Effort total is equal to:
- **1** (base)
- **+** the higher of their Wisdom or Constitution attribute modifiers
- **+** their highest psychic skill score

Thus, a psychic with a Wisdom modifier of -1, a Constitution modifier of +2, and psionic skills of Metapsionics-0 and Biopsionics-0 would have a maximum Effort score of 3. If he were to then improve his Biopsionics skill to level-1, his Effort would become 4.

### Committing Effort

Effort is "Committed" to fuel a psionic power. Some Commitment is relatively short-term, lasting only as long as the power is in effect. Other powers require that the Effort be Committed for the full scene, while the most powerful might require it be Committed for the rest of the day. Once the Commitment period is over, the Effort returns to the psychic. All Effort is refreshed after a good night's rest.

Whenever a power requires you to Commit Effort, you commit only one point, though additional effects or triggerings may require separate Commitments.

## Torching

Psychics can push past their limits by "torching", intentionally ignoring safety protocols and neural refractory periods to channel MES energy beyond their normal capacity. For untrained MES subjects, all their power use qualifies as torching, as they lack the training necessary to develop safe reserves of Effort.

### How Torching Works

Torching is an **Instant action** that can be performed once per round. It provides a free point of Effort that lasts for the rest of the scene, even if this point puts a psychic over the maximum allowed. Every time the psychic torches, however, they have to roll on the torching result table below.

### Torching Result Table

| d6 | Torching Result |
|----|-----------------|
| 1-2 | Lose 1 point from your Wisdom score |
| 3-4 | Lose 1 point from your Constitution score |
| 5 | Lose 1 point from an attribute you choose |
| 6 | No harm is done by the torching |

### Consequences of Torching

- Psychics reduced below a Wisdom score of 3 go violently insane and become "feral psychics"
- Those reduced below scores of 3 in other attributes likewise become dead or nonviable as player characters
- There is no available cure for brain damage caused by torching, and even advanced pretech technology has no generally-known remedy

## Feral Psychics

Feral psychics are exceptionally dangerous, as their form of brain damage invariably results in violent, psychotic behavior and terrifying hallucinations. Worse still, they can torch with impunity thereafter, as the MES energies have already burnt a clear path through what remains of their sanity. Feral psychics have effectively unlimited Effort with what powers they have obtained. There is no known cure for a feral psychic.
