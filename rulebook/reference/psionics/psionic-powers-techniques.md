# Psionic Powers and Techniques

## Core Techniques

Every psychic who obtains level-0 proficiency in a discipline gains access to its **core technique**. This technique varies depending on the discipline, whether it's physical translocation with Teleportation or tissue repair with Biopsionics. The strength of the ability varies with the practitioner's skill level; the Psychic Succor provided by a biopsionicist with level-0 proficiency is much weaker than that provided by someone with level-4 expertise.

Core techniques improve naturally as the psychic improves their skill level. They do not need to be purchased with skill points or otherwise specially trained.

## Additional Techniques

As a psychic improves their skill level in a discipline, they may also learn other techniques, special tricks and abilities they've refined through practice. 

### Learning Techniques

Each time they improve a skill level, they can pick a new technique from that discipline. Most techniques have a minimum skill level associated with them, and the PC can't pick a technique which requires a higher skill level than they've mastered. They also cannot "save" technique picks for later, either. They must be chosen immediately after improving the skill.

### Common vs Esoteric Techniques

The techniques listed under the disciplines here are commonly-known arts that are part of the basic curriculum of most competent psychic academies. No special training is required to choose them when a PC is able to pick a new technique, as the principles were taught as part of their basic education. Other techniques exist that are more esoteric in nature, and may require a trainer to educate the PC in their principles before they can be learned.

### Restricted Techniques

Even so, some of the standard techniques might be selectively restricted by an academy, taught only to certain pupils. In some cases, this may be due to a sponsor's restrictions on what kind of abilities they want the local psychics to possess, while other academies might consider them fundamentally immoral abilities. Control over the metapsionic technique of psychic tutoring is particularly strict, as any pupil who has its rudiments included in their curriculum may eventually be able to train other psychics in turn. A PC may have to go to significant lengths in order to patch the holes in a government-controlled psychic curriculum.

## Purchasing Additional Techniques

PCs who want to learn additional techniques beyond those acquired by improving their skills may buy them separately with skill points, paying **one point per level of the technique**. 

## Retraining Techniques

PCs who want to retrain techniques may do so at the GM's discretion, usually only when they encounter some new esoteric technique they'd like to learn in place of an existing art. Techniques can only be retrained into others of equal or lower required skill level.

## Creating New Techniques

It may be possible for a psychic to create entirely new techniques to reflect their personal aptitudes and special inclinations. Any such novelty is strictly at the GM's discretion, and unlikely to be done more than once or twice over the lifetime of even the most skilled psychic experimenter.
