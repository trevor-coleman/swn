# Mech Defenses Overview

Defensive systems for mechs provide additional protection beyond their base armor. These systems use advanced technology to reduce incoming damage or make the mech harder to hit.

## Available Defenses

### Augmented ECM Projector
- **Class Required**: Light minimum
- **Effect**: +2 AC bonus against vehicle/mech attacks, -1 Speed penalty
- **Description**: Quantum taps tuned to interfere with enemy targeting systems

### Hardened Polyceramic Overlay
- **Class Required**: Light minimum
- **Effect**: Reduces armor piercing quality of attacking weapons by 5
- **Description**: Military-grade plating that resists penetration
- **Note**: Does not stack with Vanguard Plating

### MES Shunt Channels
- **Class Required**: Suit minimum
- **Effect**: Grants Armor 10 versus Psi weaponry
- **Description**: Psitech-derived shielding against metadimensional attacks
- **Note**: Stacks with Neural Static Generator

### Morphic Silhouette Damper
- **Class Required**: Suit minimum
- **Effect**: Halves attacking weapon's effective range
- **Description**: Holoprojectors and ECM make targeting difficult
- **Limitation**: No effect if attacker within 50 meters

### Redundant Systems Buffer
- **Class Required**: Heavy only
- **Effect**: Adds +20 hit points
- **Description**: Backup systems increase damage capacity
- **Power Cost**: 10 (no multiplier)
- **Mass Cost**: 5 (no multiplier)

### Vanguard Plating
- **Class Required**: Heavy only
- **Effect**: Reduces armor piercing quality of attacking weapons by 15
- **Description**: Advanced damage control and force fields
- **Note**: Does not stack with Hardened Polyceramic Overlay

## Cost and Requirements

All defense costs and requirements follow standard mech equipment rules:
- Base costs multiply by ×3 for light mechs, ×6 for heavy mechs
- Requirements marked with # multiply by ×2 for light mechs, ×4 for heavy mechs

## Tactical Considerations

### Against Physical Weapons
- **Hardened Polyceramic Overlay** or **Vanguard Plating** reduce AP effectiveness
- **Augmented ECM Projector** makes you harder to hit but slows movement
- **Morphic Silhouette Damper** forces enemies to close distance

### Against Psi Weapons
- **MES Shunt Channels** provides dedicated psi defense
- Can be combined with Neural Static Generator fitting for maximum protection
- Hardened Polyceramic Overlay has no effect on psi weapons

### Survivability
- **Redundant Systems Buffer** dramatically increases heavy mech durability
- **Escape Pod** fitting (not a defense) improves pilot survival
- Multiple defenses can be combined for layered protection
