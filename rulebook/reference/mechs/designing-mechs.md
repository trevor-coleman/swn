# Designing Mechs

Mech hulls are defined by many of the same traits possessed by a starship, with a few adjustments made for the unique nature of these engines of war.

## Hull Characteristics

### Maintenance
Must be performed on a mech after every 24 hours of operation. For every further two hours or fraction thereof, the mech suffers a cumulative -1 on all hit rolls and skill checks. This entry gives the cost in spare parts and consumables for performing a maintenance pass on a given hull.

### Armor
Functions in the same way as starship armor for most mechs, rendering them immune to damage from anything smaller than TL4 Heavy weapons, and subtracting from any incoming damage. Suit mechs are an exception, being much smaller and comparatively more fragile. Their armor subtracts from the damage done by small arms, but Heavy weapons ignore it.

### Hit Points
Are lost as normal to attacks that damage the mech. Once the mech reaches zero hit points, the pilot must make a Physical saving throw; on a success, they escape the mech with one-quarter of their current hit points, rounded up. On a failure, they are mortally wounded. Pilots of suit-class mechs may opt to take the full damage of an attack off their own hit points after the dice are rolled, reflecting a strike that rattles or exhausts the pilot without doing significant damage to the hull itself.

### Other Traits
**Speed**, **Armor Class**, **Power**, **Free Mass**, and **Hardpoints** all function for mechs just as they do for starships. Fittings, weapons, and defenses are all added to the base hull up to the maximum load permitted by a hull's free mass and power.

## Building Process

### 1. Choose Hull Class
Select either a suit, light, or heavy mech.

### 2. Determine Type
Choose whether it will be:
- **Shock model** - Heavily-armored
- **Specialist model** - Fast and versatile
- **Psimech** - Designed for psionic pilots (rare)

Any type may be piloted by any character, but non-psychics cannot effectively use psi fittings.

### 3. Select Fittings
Each fitting has a cost in free mass and power, and the total requirements of all fittings, weapons, and defenses cannot exceed the suit's rated power and mass. Some fittings also have a minimum hull size, and cannot be mounted on smaller mechs. Psitech fittings can only be mounted on psimechs.

Mech fittings can only be installed once for any particular system, unless noted otherwise. Mech fittings usually require a particular minimum hull class for installation, with suit-class hulls being unable to mount certain larger systems. Psi-based fittings can be mounted only on psimechs and can be used only by psionic pilots.

### 4. Select Weaponry and Defenses
Taking into account their free mass and power costs. Weapons also take up one or more hardpoints, and a mech is limited in the number of available hardpoints for a given model. A mech may be equipped with as many weapons as it has hardpoints, power, and mass to support.

### 5. Calculate Total Cost
Tally up the cost of the hull, fittings, weapons, and defenses, and make sure that you haven't overspent your available power, mass, hardpoints, or budget.

## Availability

Most TL4 worlds aren't capable of building mechs. They were always specialized tools, most useful in interplanetary warfare where logistics limits were tight, and the lack of rare resources and need has contributed to the loss of the tech. Still, at the GM's discretion, some worlds may still be able to build them from scratch.
