# Mech Fittings Overview

Mech fittings are specialized equipment and systems that enhance a mech's capabilities beyond basic combat functions. Each fitting has power and mass requirements that must be accommodated by the hull.

## Fitting Categories

### Mobility Enhancements
- **Antigrav Nodes** - Allows flight in most gravitic environments
- **Grav Chutes** - Enables orbital insertion without damage
- **Void Thrusters** - Flight in zero/microgravity environments

### Sensor & Communications
- **Polyspectral Sensors** - Penetrating scan within 100 meters
- **Panoptic Cloud** - Swarm sensors in 200m radius
- **Skywatch Drones** - Deployable recon drones (10km range)
- **Pulse Transceiver** - FTL communication within system
- **Comm Interceptors** - Decrypt enemy communications

### Combat Support
- **Ammunition Cells** - Extended ammo supply (can stack)
- **Fire Control Unit/Master** - Coordinate fire with slave units
- **Fire Control Unit/Slave** - Links to master unit
- **Active Camo Surface** - Stealth at distance

### Utility Systems
- **Cargo Space** - Protected storage (100kg suit/500kg light/2000kg heavy)
- **Construction Array** - Mobile repair/construction facility
- **Breaching Tool** - Demolition charges for obstacles
- **Bridging Laminates** - Creates temporary bridges
- **Field Medical Unit** - Battlefield medical support
- **Integral Maintenance** - Auto-maintenance capability
- **Escape Pod** - Improves pilot survival chances

### Environmental
- **Augmented Enviroseals** - Extended hostile environment operation
- **Drop Sheathing** - Conceals orbital insertion

### Psitech Fittings (Psimech Only)
- **Inquisitor Probe** - Read tactical intentions (Telepathy)
- **Jump Coil** - Teleport multiple mechs (Teleportation)
- **Kinesis Boost** - +2 Speed and initiative (Telekinesis)
- **Neural Activity Sensors** - Detect minds within 2km (Any psychic)
- **Neural Static Generator** - Negate psi fittings (Metapsionics)
- **Omen Tap** - Force rerolls (Precognition)
- **Vivification Field** - Auto-stabilize allies (Biopsionics)

## Installation Rules

- Most fittings can only be installed once unless noted
- Power/Mass requirements marked with # multiply by:
  - ×2 for light mechs
  - ×4 for heavy mechs
- Base costs multiply by:
  - ×3 for light mechs
  - ×6 for heavy mechs
- Minimum hull class requirements must be met
- Psitech fittings require psimech hull and psychic pilot

## Notable Fittings

### Ammunition Cells
One of the few fittings that can be installed multiple times. Each installation allows ignoring one failed ammunition check per maintenance cycle.

### Construction Array
Allows the mech to serve as a mobile workshop for repairs and maintenance of itself and other mechs. Can carry repair parts equal to twice the mech's HP.

### Fire Control Units
Master unit coordinates with up to 5 slave units within 1km, allowing sequential targeting instead of simultaneous fire.
