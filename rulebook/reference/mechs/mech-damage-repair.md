# Mech Damage and Repair

## Taking Damage

Mechs take damage normally, but leave their pilot unharmed until they are finally destroyed. In most cases, the enormous energies being thrown around a modern battlefield make the wearer's hit points largely irrelevant. 

### Suit-Class Exception

For small mech suits, however, the individual toughness and stamina of the pilot can make a difference. When a suit-class mech is damaged by an attack, the pilot may choose to take the entire hit off their own hit points, to represent their gradual loss of stamina, focus, and luck.

## Mech Destruction

Mechs are fully functional until their last hit points are destroyed. Once reduced to zero hit points, the hull is inoperable and the pilot is exposed to the outside atmosphere. In hostile environments, most pilots wear vacc suits against this unfortunate possibility.

### Pilot Survival

The pilot of a mech reduced to zero hit points must make a **Physical save**:
- **On a success**: They escape the hull with one-quarter of their current hit points, rounded up
- **On a failure**: They are mortally wounded and will require swift application of biopsionics or lazarus patches if they are to survive

## Repair Costs and Process

### Material Costs
- **Suit repair**: 500 credits per hit point
- **Light/Heavy mech repair**: 1,000 credits per hit point

### Repair Speed

A single tech can repair a number of hull points of damage equal to their **Fix skill plus one** for each hour of work.

### Facility Requirements
- **Suits**: Can be repaired with no more than the necessary spare parts and a portable toolkit
- **Light and heavy mechs**: Require more sophisticated repair facilities. Remote repair vehicles and heavy haulers are standard support elements for most mech units

## Environmental Resistance

Mechs can resist any normal extreme of environment, from hard vacuum to a planetary atmosphere of poisonous vapors. Any environment harsh enough to damage a vehicle will apply the same penalties to a mech. 

### Life Support
- **Mech suits**: Equipped with three days of food, water, and atmosphere
- **Light and heavy mechs**: Can support their occupants for up to a week

## Manipulation and Smashing

Mechs are remarkably agile machines, and can perform any act of physical dexterity possible for a normal human being. All suits and most larger hulls are equipped with "hands" of some sort for manipulating objects, usually waldoed to even finer manipulators that can handle and utilize human-scale objects. Integral stability gravs in all mechs allow them to move over any surface that can support their weight. 

### Building Navigation
- **Suit hulls**: Can operate without major difficulty inside most buildings
- **Light and heavy mechs**: Usually forced to remain on roadways or solid ground if they lack grav flight

### Breaking Through Obstacles

Mech hulls are extremely strong. Time to breach standard postech exterior walls:
- **Suit**: 4 rounds for a suit-sized hole
- **Light mech**: 2 rounds for a mech-sized hole
- **Heavy mech**: 1 round for a huge hole

Lighter or more primitive construction gives way in half the time, while fortified armorplast barriers may require 1d6 times as many rounds, or be completely impervious.

### Lifting Capacity
- **Suits**: Can lift and carry one metric ton
- **Light mechs**: Can manage five tons
- **Heavy mechs**: Can manage twenty tons

More than this might be theoretically possible for a hull, but it taxes the grav stabilizers too badly, and will almost always end up toppling the mech or "fenceposting" it thigh-deep into the softer soil beneath it.

## Skill Rolls in Mechs

Skill rolls made in a mech suit are treated as normal skill checks, with **Pilot** being the relevant skill.
