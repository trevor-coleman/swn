# Mech Weapons Overview

Mech weaponry normally requires Shoot skill to fire and relies on the user's Intelligence or Dexterity to determine hit and damage modifiers. Most NPC pilots have a total attack bonus of +3 and damage bonus of +1. Veteran pilots average +5 to hit and +2 damage, while the grizzled elite rarely have less than +7 to hit and +2 damage.

## Weapon Qualities

### Ammo
This weapon uses physical ammunition. After the end of every fight in which it was fired, the pilot needs to make a Shoot skill check modified by Wisdom against a difficulty of 6. On a failure, ammo for the gun has run out until the next maintenance cycle is complete. The check difficulty increases by 1 after every fight until maintenance.

### Anti-personnel
Armored vehicles, fortifications, and light and heavy mechs are immune to these light weapons.

### AP (Armor Piercing)
The weapon ignores this many points of a target's armor. The Hardened Polyceramic Overlay or Vanguard Plating defense upgrades may lessen the effectiveness of this quality. The most a weapon's AP rating can do is reduce a target's effective armor to zero. It cannot add additional damage to a hit.

### Cone
The weapon fires in a conical pattern that many meters long and wide at its end. All targets within the cone must make an Evasion saving throw or be hit, with no hit roll required. Targets behind hard cover save automatically.

### Melee
Melee weapons can only be used in hand-to-hand combat, and no non-melee weapon can be used that same round. Pilots use either Punch or Stab for hit rolls. Mech melee weapons do not inflict Shock damage.

### Psi
Psi weapons use metadimensional energy channels to completely ignore a target's Armor rating, except for any armor granted by the MES Shunt Channel defense fitting. Defenses such as Hardened Polyceramic Overlay have no effect on psi weaponry. Pilots may optionally choose to use an appropriate psychic skill with psi weapons, even melee varieties. Psi weapons rely on Wisdom or Constitution to modify attack and damage rolls, rather than Dexterity or Intelligence.

### Slow
After firing, the attacker must roll an Int/Shoot skill check against difficulty 8. For psi weapons, use Int and an applicable psychic skill. On a failure, the gun must cool down for one round before it can be fired again.

### Suppressive Fire (#)
Weapons marked with # can be fired to suppress. Every target in front of the weapon that is not under hard cover is automatically hit for half normal damage, rounded down. A successful Evasion saving throw by the targets eliminates this damage.
