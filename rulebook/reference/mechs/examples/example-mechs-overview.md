## Design Philosophy Examples

### Budget Builds
The Achilles shows how a basic shock suit can be effective with just good armor and versatile weapons for 178k credits.

### Support Platforms
The Ulysses and Curtana demonstrate non-combat roles, trading weapons for sensors, medical, and communication gear.

### Ammunition Management
The Angurvadal and Scorn both mount double ammunition cells to support their suppressive weapons through extended engagements.

### Psychic Integration
The three psimech designs (Hecate, Durandal, Despite) show increasing integration of psitech, from basic platform to full psi-warrior.

### Survivability vs Firepower
Compare the Scorn (max armor, siege weapons) to the Odium (moderate defense, utility focus) for different approaches to heavy mech design.
