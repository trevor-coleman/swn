# Mech Maintenance

The fusion cores that power the hulls require no refueling, but the engines, servos, magazines, electronics, and fittings all need regular maintenance and refitting in order to remain functional.

## Operational Time

Mechs can operate up to **24 hours** before maintenance is required. For each further two hours of operation, a cumulative **-1 penalty** is applied to all hit rolls and skill checks with the mech. When the penalty hits **-10**, the mech shuts down.

"Parked" mechs don't count as being in active use.

## Maintenance Requirements

### Tools and Facilities
Maintenance for a hull requires the same tools and facilities as does repair:
- **Suits**: Portable toolkit and spare parts
- **Light and heavy mechs**: Support vehicles with work cranes and extensive tool selections

### Maintenance Speed
In one hour, a single tech can maintain:
- **Heavy mechs**: Number equal to their Fix skill rating plus one
- **Light mechs**: Twice as many as heavy mechs
- **Suits**: Four times as many as heavy mechs

### Maintenance Costs
A maintenance cycle requires spare parts and ammunition costing:
- **Suit**: 500 credits
- **Light mech**: 1,000 credits
- **Heavy mech**: 2,000 credits

## Field Operations

Keeping a mech force in the field is expensive. Most commanders prefer to run a maintenance cycle daily, though some resource-strapped leaders minimize the active use of their mechs and try to stretch out the periods between upkeep. These frugal ways can come back to haunt a detachment when they're suddenly pressed by enemies who have no intention of giving them the time they require to refit their mechs.
