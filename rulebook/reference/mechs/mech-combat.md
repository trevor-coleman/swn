# Mech Combat

Combat involving mechs operates in much the same way as any other form of combat. Mechs have weapons, an armor class based on their durability and size, and hit points to reflect their physical condition. Combat largely works just as it does at human or starship scales, with a few adjustments.

## Armor and Damage

Mechs have Armor ratings in the same way that other vehicles do, and suit-class mechs use it the same way. The Armor score is subtracted from the damage done by each attack that hits, except for damage done by explosives or TL4 Heavy weapons or that done by other massive tools of violent disassembly. 

Light and heavy mechs are even more durable, and are **immune to ordinary small arms**, subtracting their Armor rating from the damage done by Heavy weapons.

## Movement

Mechs also have Speed ratings which are used just as described in the Vehicles section of the equipment chapter, with Pilot as the relevant skill for checks. 

For situations when it is important to determine a mech's movement rating in meters:
- **Suit speed** × 10 meters = movement per round
- **Light/Heavy mech speed** × 20 meters = movement per round

## Weapon Fire

A mech's pilot can fire **all of the guns** mounted on a mech each turn, and may fire them at different targets within range. Targets must all be selected before the attacks begin, however, and cannot be altered that round. If all guns are trained on an enemy who's taken out with the first lucky shot, the remaining attacks are wasted. 

Suit pilots can fire personal weapons if they choose, but they cannot fire both their own sidearms and their suit's equipment in the same round.

## Ammunition

Most mechs have substantial internal ammunition magazines, but the amount is not unlimited. A single attack roll might represent several seconds of full-auto gunfire. 

After each fight in which an ammunition-using weapon is fired, the pilot must make a **Shoot skill check** modified by Wisdom against difficulty 6. On a success, he fired judiciously and still has ammunition remaining. On a failure, he has run out of ammo for that gun. The difficulty of the check increases by 1 after each fight. 

Ammunition magazines are fully refreshed as part of each mech's maintenance cycle. Energy weapons, melee weaponry, and psitech guns never run out of ammunition.

## Quantum ECM

The integral quantum ECM tap arrays mounted on light and heavy mechs negate almost all indirect guided ordnance within line of sight of the mech, defeating incoming projectiles up to ten or twenty kilometers away, depending on conditions. 

As a general rule, on a battlefield with mechs, an attacker needs to be able to see a target to hit it. Alternately, dumb fire rockets or heavy artillery can be used to bombard a mech force, as these munitions have no guidance systems to scramble. This ECM is not relevant in defending against the weapons listed in this section, but it can make an enormous difference on a battlefield contested by advanced military forces.

## Mechs, Psionics, and Abilities

Mechs are treated as extensions of the wearer for the purpose of special abilities. Warriors can use their class ability to avoid or ensure a hit while piloting one, and psionic abilities that apply effects to an ally or enemy usually apply to their mech as well if such an effect is reasonable. 

The precognitive benefits of Destiny's Shield can plausibly aid a mech pilot, for example, but none of the biopsionic powers could mend scorched metal and broken composites. Mechs are not valid targets for the Synthetic Adaptation biopsionic technique.

### Teleportation

Psychics with the Teleportation discipline can teleport their mech at no additional weight cost if it is a psimech. Teleporters with level Teleportation-2 or greater skill in the discipline can manage to shift the weight of a suit even if it isn't a psimech variant. Light and heavy mechs of the shock or specialist variety are too heavy for any teleporter to move.

## Damaging Mechs

Mechs are extremely difficult to damage. Even a light mech is armored with advanced pretech composites and active defenses sufficient to shrug off all but the most advanced or brutal weaponry.

By default, **only TL4 Heavy weapons can harm a light or heavy mech**. Old-fashioned RPGs or machine guns just can't muster the necessary force to crack the iron shells of these engines.

In some cases, however, TL3 hardware is sufficient to harm a mech. Heavy shaped charges can damage a mech, as can direct hits by howitzers or other field artillery. Such attacks will still have to contend with the mech's Armor rating, but they could at least theoretically bring down the beast.

Other forces simply upgrade existing TL3 tech into TL4 equivalents. These weapons have the same combat statistics as their more primitive brethren, but they're equipped with the advanced explosive charges or augmented ammunition that can hurt a modern mech. PCs who want to get their hands on these upgraded machine guns and rocket launchers can usually find them on any TL4 world with an active arms trading industry.
