# Piloting Mechs

## Control Systems

Mech control systems rely on contact-free neural scanning and imaging technology combined with induced somatic feedback projectors. No special harness is required, and any armor with an encumbrance value of 1 or less can be worn by a pilot without interfering with the mech's operation. 

## Security

There is almost never any kind of key or lockout on a combat mech; the security of the mech is usually based on it being located in the middle of a high-tech military base, and not on possession of a keycard or passcode. 

## Training Requirements

A few hours of basic training will allow anyone to operate a mech, though elaborate maneuvers may be impossible for those without at least **Pilot-0** skill. Most somatic controls are sufficiently flexible to handle human, alien, VI, or True AI pilots.

## Interfacing Time

Interfacing with a mech requires **1d6 rounds, minus the pilot's Pilot skill**. Climbing into a light or heavy mech cockpit usually takes an additional round, as does donning a suit.

## Cargo Capacity

There is normally room inside a mech to transport the wearer's readied and stowed equipment:
- **Suit-class mech**: Can carry a hundred kilos of additional gear without slowing down
- **Light and heavy mechs**: Can cart around tons worth of cargo

Such loads tend to be highly vulnerable to enemy fire, as they're often protected by nothing thicker than a width of cargo netting. In most cases, it won't be important for the GM to worry about encumbrance for mech pilots. If the mech is blown up and the pilot survives, he escapes with his usual gear while anything strapped to the mech is destroyed.
