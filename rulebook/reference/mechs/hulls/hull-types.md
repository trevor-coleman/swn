## Hull Statistics Table

| Hull | Cost | Maint | Speed | Armor | HP | AC | Power | Mass | Hardpt | Class |
|------|------|-------|-------|-------|----|-------|-------|------|--------|-------|
| **Shock Suit** | 150k | 500 | 4 | 12# | 15* | 18 | 10 | 5 | 2 | Suit |
| **Specialist Suit** | 150k | 500 | 6 | 8# | 10* | 17 | 5 | 10 | 1 | Suit |
| **Psi Suit** | 300k | 500 | 4 | 8# | 15* | 20 | 5 | 5 | 1 | Suit |
| **Light Shock** | 500k | 1,000 | 3 | 15 | 40 | 16 | 20 | 10 | 3 | Light |
| **Light Specialist** | 500k | 1,000 | 5 | 10 | 30 | 15 | 10 | 20 | 2 | Light |
| **Light Psimech** | 1m | 1,000 | 3 | 10 | 40 | 17 | 10 | 10 | 2 | Light |
| **Heavy Shock** | 1m | 2,000 | 2 | 25 | 70 | 15 | 40 | 20 | 6 | Heavy |
| **Heavy Specialist** | 1m | 2,000 | 4 | 15 | 50 | 14 | 20 | 40 | 3 | Heavy |
| **Heavy Psimech** | 2m | 2,000 | 2 | 15 | 60 | 16 | 15 | 15 | 3 | Heavy |

**Notes:**
- **#** Suit-class armor does not apply against Heavy weapons. Light and Heavy mechs are immune to non-Heavy attacks.
- **\*** Pilots of suit-class mechs may choose to take an attack's damage against their own hit points after it is rolled.

## Hull Types Explained

### Shock Hulls
Designed for direct assault on hardened fortifications or for anti-mech combat. These hulls prioritize:
- Heavy armor plating
- Multiple weapon hardpoints
- High power capacity for energy weapons
- Reduced mobility in exchange for durability

### Specialist Hulls
Optimized for particular battlefield duties, especially defensive measures and high-mobility recon. Features include:
- Enhanced speed and maneuverability
- Greater free mass for support equipment
- Balanced power and mass allocations
- Fewer hardpoints but more versatile loadouts

### Psimech Hulls
The rarest of the three varieties, ancient pretech hulls intended to amplify the abilities of a psychic pilot for battlefield use. Characteristics:
- Enhanced armor class from psychic resonance
- Designed to mount psitech fittings
- Can only use full potential with psionic pilots
- Significantly more expensive than other hull types
- Better base AC due to psychic shielding integration

## Cost Multipliers for Equipment

When purchasing fittings, weapons, and defenses for mechs:
- **Light mechs**: Multiply base costs by 3
- **Heavy mechs**: Multiply base costs by 6
- **Suits**: Use base costs as listed

## Power and Mass Multipliers

Some equipment has requirements marked with #. For these:
- **Light mechs**: Multiply requirement by 2
- **Heavy mechs**: Multiply requirement by 4
- **Suits**: Use requirement as listed
