# Mechs Overview

Hulking figures of ceraplast, reinforced plating, and all-important quantum tap arrays, mechs were some of the most imposing war machines of the Second Wave of human expansion. While few worlds retain the economic base to build and support these titans of war, some can still be found in long-abandoned Mandate military bases or in the armies of worlds that have jealously preserved the secrets of their construction.

## History

### Born in Fire (2348)

At the beginning of the Second Wave of human colonization, warfare on advanced worlds had become almost exclusively a matter of standoff engagements. Microdrones, sat-missiles, and guided ordnance of every variety made the battlefield a living hell for those luckless infantry who were forced to face a well-equipped enemy. Attackers could engage at trans-continental range with very little chance of their missiles and drones being brought down, as their command channel encryption was simply too good and their ECCM too strong for defensive jammers to defeat. All the advantages were with the offense.

It wasn't until 2348 and the escape of the rogue AI Draco that this deadlock was broken. The quantum tap techniques that Draco had used to translate his matrix core data into a nearby warship could be repurposed to other uses. Instead of attempting to defeat a hostile projectile's guidance cryptography, a jammer could reach into the device's electronic brain to scramble the contents with a blast of random static.

### Made In His Image (2405)

While quantum tap technology was an easy fit for starships, developing a mobile ground version was much more difficult. The tap required several emitters kept at appropriate distances from each other to avoid cross-interference. Furthermore, the taps had to be several meters above the planetary surface if they were to avoid confusing backscatter.

It wasn't until 2405 that a researcher finally entertained the idea of a humanoid walker as a platform for a tap array. Mounting the emitters in the walker's "forearms" and "neck" would maintain a reasonably efficient spatial configuration, and would lift the emitters high enough to avoid terrestrial backscatter. The walker itself would be a powerful computing platform and generator mount to support the ECM generated by the emitters, and the armor would give the taps a better chance of surviving the battlefield.

### Refinement and Decay

As with any military device, mech development rapidly specialized into several different forms and designs, all calibrated to different purposes on the battlefield. Even the enigmatic researchers of the Psionic Authority became involved in their development.

There were three major types of mech hulls:
- **Shock mechs** - Designed for direct assault on hardened fortifications or for anti-mech combat
- **Specialist hulls** - Optimized for particular battlefield duties, especially defensive measures and high-mobility recon
- **Psimech hulls** - The rarest of the three varieties, ancient pretech hulls intended to amplify the abilities of a psychic pilot for battlefield use

## Mech Classes

Mechs are classified by hull size:

### Suits
- Little more than armored exoskeletons roughly **3 meters tall**
- Intended to support small teams of elite shock troopers
- Most suits are too small to mount quantum tap arrays
- Can operate inside most buildings

### Light Mechs
- **6 to 8 meters tall**
- Most maneuverable and agile of the mech classes
- Large enough to support fusion cores for antigrav fins or heavy weaponry
- Can mount surprisingly vicious weapon loadouts

### Heavy Mechs
- Titans of the battlefield, **10 to 13 meters tall**
- Significant drain on fusion cores
- Can mount the widest range of defensive equipment and thickest armor
- Usually forced to remain on roadways or solid ground unless equipped with grav flight

## The Fall of Mechs

Despite their elaborate development, mech deployment became more and more uncommon in the latter years of the Second Wave. They were an expensive solution to a minor problem on the frontier, where brushfire wars and guerrilla insurgencies rarely had the vast stores of guided munitions that had scourged the older battlefields of the core worlds. For the price of a single heavy shock mech and a few months of its maintenance, a commander could acquire four gravtanks and their vortex cannon armaments, or scores of Nemesis expert-system warbots.

In the chaos of the Scream and the Silence that followed, most of the known mech caches were plundered for spare parts. Others were raised for a last ride to damnation as their owners spent them extravagantly to seize disordered worlds. Few were left operational forty years after the disaster, and on even fewer worlds did sufficient industry remain to rebuild or repair them.

## Modern Mechs

Those mechs that do remain are often units recovered from a long-lost Mandate cache or deep-space supply depot. A few worlds still have the tech sufficient to build them, and a logistical pipe somehow too limited to allow for mass movement of troops or armor. These worlds are rare, and it is more often that surviving mechs are simply used as the shock troopers for a larger army of more conventional weaponry.
