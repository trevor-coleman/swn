GAME MASTER RESOURCES
The following pages include a number of tables for the
quick generation of NPCs, patrons, names, place names,
and quick encounters. The tables are in no way intended to be exhaustive or particularly detailed. They are
simply quick conveniences for the GM to spare constant reference to the internet or other books to nail
down the basic flavoring of their NPCs.
Aside from these tables, this section also discusses
some of the more common issues that arise for GMs
of Stars Without Number. PC death, the role of combat,
when to use skill checks, how to handle investigations,
and other potentially sticky elements are reviewed and
advice given for the practical handling of these matters.
In addition, this chapter gives some guidelines on
converting material from the first edition of the game
to the current revised rules. A selection of potential
house rules are also suggested for groups that wish to
customize their game a little more.
When applying any of these guidelines or suggestions, however, it is important that you remember a
critical thing about running the game at your table.

Your Game and Your Group

The most important thing you can remember as a GM
running Stars Without Number is that you are running
it for a specific group of people. You are not running it
for a generic Typical Gamer, you are running it for Bob
and Eunice and Feng and Tyler. There is no genericized
advice that can be applied to your specific group that is
nearly as helpful as your own powers of social expertise
and your personal knowledge of the table.
Game designers sometimes fall into the trap of
trying to force social outcomes at the table through
specific game rules. These rules can encourage certain
outcomes in the general case, but they cannot compel
results. They are certainly not nearly as effective in producing an outcome as you, the GM, can be, because
these rules can’t know your players as well as you do.
Whenever you consider making a house rule, or
adding a tweak to the game, or even basic considerations of what kind of sandbox excitement you should
be offering to your players, you must always think
about the specific players you have. Don’t worry about
the Typical Gamer. The Typical Gamer is not at your
table. If Bob really wants a new focus that allows his PC
to do a particular trick, you do not need to think of all
the ways a Typical Gamer could abuse or misuse that
new power. You need to think of the ways Bob could
misuse it. Maybe he is the kind of gamer who would be
very disruptive to the game with the ability, and maybe
you know how he plays well enough to tell that he’d
never cause a problem with it. The same ability that
would be absolutely terrible in the hands of some players can be perfectly safe in the hands of others. Only
you can reasonably tell which is which.

The same general attitude is necessary towards
other elements of your campaign, not just the house
rules. You need to think about how your specific players are likely to react to plot hooks, campaign elements,
and new additions to the game. If you know Eunice
was bored out of her mind by an adventure session
that revolved around trading, it’s probably a bad idea
to offer her hooks that focus on commercial dealings,
or at least talk it over with her outside the game before
you introduce it to make sure there’s something about
the hook that she can find engaging.
As the GM, you already have a lot of responsibility
on your shoulders. You have the adventures to create,
the sandbox to populate, and the game itself to run. It
is very unlikely that you have the energy or the time
to worry about creating universally-functional house
rules and generalized systems. That is the game designer’s job. It’s up to me to give you general rules that will
work well in most situations and provide serviceable
results with the Typical Gamer. That kind of averaged-out design is necessary if you’re to be provided
with a basic toolbox of useful mechanics and systems.
But you can do better, because you know your
audience. You know what they want, what they’re
interested in, and how they’re likely to use the tools
you hand them. You can create specific house rules and
case-by-case permissions that mold your game to fit the
needs and interests of your own table.
Stars Without Number is designed in the spirit of
old-school gaming, where these sort of house rules and
campaign-specific systems are totally acceptable and
perfectly normal. This game is not a delicate flower
that will wilt if you touch it the wrong way. It is built
on a basic mechanical chassis more than forty years old,
a veritable AK-47 of game design, and it can take an
incredible amount of punishment and careless handling
without breaking. You will not ruin your game by adding in house rules that make sense to you.
This game belongs to you and your players. As
the designer, I only get a vote in how things should be;
the ultimate decision is always with you and your play
group. Only you properly understand the goals of your
group and the kind of fun you want to have, and only
you and your players can provide the definitive understanding of your ultimate aim. I am providing you with
a basic structure that will work for most groups, but it’s
up to you to add the chrome or tweaks that you want.
Perhaps you won’t need to add any. It may well be
that the rules exactly as written serve your purpose just
fine, and you have no particular desire to tweak them.
If that’s the case, then that’s fine. But you should never
be afraid to reach in and adjust things to improve your
own play. Add systems from other old-school-inspired
games, brew up your own rules, or excise bits that don’t
fit. This game is yours, and you should play it your way.

232• COMPLICATIONS

COMMON GAME MASTER COMPLICATIONS
Once you’ve successfully created your sector and gathered the players, you might find a few difficulties cropping up in the course of play. There are certain pitfalls
and complications that are particular to the style of play
that Stars Without Number encourages, and it’s helpful
to have an idea beforehand of how to deal with them.

Death

Characters in Stars Without Number die easily. The
average third-level psychic might well be taken out
by a lucky pistol round, and even high-level warriors
don’t have more than 60 or 70 hit points. It’s true that
biopsionics and lazarus patches can revive characters
that get medical help in time, but there are plenty of
situations where there’s just not time to save a teammate or the attempt proves a failure. If the rules are
used as written, PCs who regularly put themselves in
dangerous situations are going to die.
You and your players should decide at the start of
the game how you want to deal with this. For maximum old-school authenticity, you might mutually decide to just let the dice fall where they may. If Captain
Spaulding plunges into the sulfur volcanoes of Badghati
IV, the high-level veteran of dozens of daring interstellar escapades gets a touching space memorial and
his player rolls up a replacement. This is the default
assumption of the game, and it can add a great deal of
excitement and reward to the sensation of navigating
a character through lethal challenges.
It can also really aggravate players who enjoy
building deeply-involved PCs with many close ties to
the game world and its characters. A GM can decide to
omit the risk of death in most cases, reducing PCs with
0 hit points to “gravely wounded” status and allowing
them to be revived with medical attention. Some situations might run the risk of real death, but the GM
can save this for occasions of genuine dramatic importance. There’s nothing at all wrong with this approach
to death, and it can help some players focus on the story
that they and their group are creating rather than living
in fear of every goon with a combat rifle.
Of course, there are shades of gray between these
two extremes, and most GMs come to inhabit some
point on this spectrum. There are many ways the GM
can lessen the risk of death without out-and-out denying it. In particular, the GM can cause enemies to
spread their attacks over a group rather than focusing
on the weakest PC. Hostiles can pay more attention to
the warriors in the group rather than the experts or
psychics, especially when the Warrior has yet to use his
class ability to negate a hit. You can take care not to include instant-death traps or devices in your adventures,
or fabricate situations where a character’s life hinges on
a single die roll. You can include substantial numbers
of NPC henchmen and companions in an adventure,

and let them soak up a portion of the danger. All of
these tactics can be used to tacitly lessen the danger of
character death without taking it off the table.
Sooner or later, however, it’s likely that some PC is
going to kick the bucket. At that point, it becomes necessary to get a replacement into the action. The replacement PC should be added as quickly as possible, and it
can often be advantageous for players to roll up these
replacements before the game even starts, so they have
a character in hand should their former PC catch a bad
case of laser poisoning. Creating the characters beforehand also allows the group to set up ties of association
that help justify why they’re suddenly willing to include
the new PC in their adventures. These replacements
can be members of the crew of the ship they’re travelling on, outworlders slouching around the local bars,
wanderers gone native among the locals, or prisoners
of whatever nefarious group the party is fighting. The
key factor is to get the replacement into action quickly,
so the player who’s lost his or her PC isn’t punished
with inactivity at the table as well as PC loss.
It’s generally easiest to have the replacement PC
be the same level as the dead PC. For high-level adventures, it’s distressingly likely that a low-level PC would
die quickly when facing challenges of that caliber. If
they do come in at a lower level, you’re going to have
to make some allowances when it comes time for them
to gain experience points. If everyone is gaining points
at the same rate, the lower-level PC will never catch
up; you may want to give them a bonus after each adventure to ensure that eventually they match the same
level of competence as the rest of the crew.

Skill Checks

Skill checks are susceptible to overuse. Some GMs end
up forcing a skill check on everything more complicated than tying your bootlaces, or prohibit PCs from
even hoping to accomplish a feat for which they lack
the appropriate skill. Skill checks are not meant to be
the sole way that a PC gets something accomplished
in the world.
You should be charitable about the things a character can accomplish without a skill check. If an Expert’s
concept is that of a crack spaceship pilot with a Dexterity modifier of +2 and Pilot-2 skill, you shouldn’t be
expecting him to make skill checks to operate the ship
under normal conditions. He can take off, he can land,
he can get to places in the system without bothering
with skill checks. Even someone with Pilot-0 should
likely be able to do as much, except the expert pilot
can do it without a check even amid high winds and
low visibility. Let the PCs be good at their chosen focus.
Don’t spam skill checks. If a character is trying
to repair a fusion power plant while under fire from
badlands raiders, don’t turn it into a roll-each-turn ex-

COMPLICATIONS •233
travaganza to determine how far he progresses in his
attempt. Let him roll once, with a failure meaning either that he can’t do it in the available time or that he’ll
need another 1d6 rounds before he can bring the defense laser power plant online. Give him player choices
each turn, like deciding whether to bring a laser online
early and risk a short in the wiring. Let a single skill
check indicate the general course of success or failure,
but then let the PC make additional choices rather than
additional rolls. Rolls can only add so much tension,
and tension alone does not guarantee engagement with
a situation.
Don’t require a skill check unless failing it means
something. If a character can simply keep trying at
something with no real negative consequences, it’s
not worth a skill check. They’ll get it sooner or later,
so it’s easiest to just tell them that it was successful. If
time is important and there’s a significant difference
between accomplishing it instantly or accomplishing it
soon, just follow a failed skill check with a roll of 1d6
and assume that many rounds, minutes, or hours go by
before the PC finally gets it right.
Don’t ignore actions taken outside of skill checks.
If a character jams a titanium wrecking bar into the
cogs of an alien death trap, you probably shouldn’t require him to make a successful Fix roll to disable the device. What he’s done will objectively work, and there’s
no point or need in rolling for it. If there’s a casket
of luminous Mettauan glass underneath the senator’s
bed, then the players will find it if they look under the
bed, and no Notice check is needed to see if they notice
it. Skill checks are best used to reflect the results of a
complicated or uncertain attempt at an action. If the
PC tries something that anyone can do and that would
have an obvious result, then just let the result happen.
Don’t use a skill check unless the outcome is unclear.

Combat

Combat in Stars Without Number tends to be fairly lethal. One good roll by a pistol-wielding thug can take
out almost any first level character, and characters never really scale to the point where they can afford to hold
enemies in contempt. You should take care to structure
your adventures and situations so that PCs are very
rarely forced into fights. The shotguns and laser rifles
should come out either because the PCs have chosen
to use them or because they’re facing the consequences
of their own missteps.
Because combat is so dangerous, it’s vital to allow the PCs to set it up on their own terms, assuming
they’re cunning and prudent enough to take advantage
of their opportunities. Ambushes, AC bonuses for cover, and the use of the environment to hurt and baffle
their foes should all be encouraged. If a character wants
to use an element of the environment to do something
interesting, let them. “You do that, and nothing happens.” is rarely a good answer for any halfway plausible
PC action.

Enemies should also be played as their morale indicates. A pack of street thugs will not transform into
Spartans at Thermopylae, dying to the last man to
prevent the PCs from discovering their gang hideout.
Even trained and disciplined combatants are going to
have serious thoughts about retreat as soon as their
comrades start dying. Only when enemies feel trapped
or are defending something as precious to them as their
lives will they normally fight to the last.

Negotiation and Diplomacy

There is a Talk skill, and the fact that this and similar
social skills exist sometimes causes players or GMs to
simply shut off more informal evaluations of social
situations. When the PC wants to convince an NPC
of something, they roll Cha/Talk and let the dice tell
them how far the NPC is willing to buy their premise.
The actual words and arguments they use are simply
decorations to the event.
On one level, this is justifiable. The player of the
Warrior isn’t expected to be a real-life shootist to roll
a good attack roll, so why should the player of the silver-tongued Expert con man have to come up with
a smooth line of patter to use his own abilities? It’s
legitimate and reasonable to let the dice determine the
success of a conversational gambit. If a player has spent
character resources on something like social skills, they
should see a mechanical benefit from it. Moreover, relying on a player’s conversational talents to move negotiations can often boil down to a game of finding the
right conversational gambit for the GM rather than
rationally persuading the NPC.
Still, some players and GMs prefer to let actual
argumentation play a bigger role. One potential way to
do this is to let the player state his or her case, and then
set the Talk check difficulty accordingly. Convincing a
crime boss to give a PC access to his network of corrupt
city officials might be a difficulty 8 test if the player
makes a good argument for it, while a desultory request
might be difficulty 10. Alternately, you might implicitly
adjust the consequences of success or failure based on
the character’s total Charisma and skill bonus. A character with a +5 total might not succeed in persuading
the crime boss if they roll very low, but he’ll point them
towards someone who might be able to help them. The
key for this sort of approach is to let both skills and
player argumentation have a visible effect on the outcome, so that players feel that both matter.
In either case, you should make clear to the group
which model will be used when they’re making up their
characters. It prevents difficulty later when the player
running the character with a -1 Charisma modifier and
no social skills expects his own glib tongue to carry the
day with NPCs.

234• COMPLICATIONS

Searching and Investigation

Many adventures rely on the party solving a mystery
or unearthing the dark truths behind some enigmatic event. PCs can occasionally get frustrated by these
adventures when they feel that they’ve hit a dead end
or are presented with a set of clues that they, the players, can’t hope to puzzle out. Conversely, players can
sometimes grow bored when the adventures become
a sequence of skill tests, with the PCs simply trying to
roll high so that the GM will let them advance.
Running a good investigation-based adventure
can be difficult, but there are a few tactics that can be
useful to a GM. First, identify those pieces of information that must be found in order to solve the puzzle.
Cracking the secret organlegging ring run out of the
city’s child protective services department might hinge
on identifying the secret lab in which the organs are
harvested, the corrupt CPS chief who hides the goods
in her home, and the crooked physician who launders
the organs into the donor system. These three facts
have to be discovered in order for the PCs to progress.
Once you’ve established the facts, watch for opportunities to let them be discovered. Drawn in by the
hook of a recurring urchin NPC they knew who vanished after being picked up by protective services, the
PCs might check out the NPC’s old haunts or associates,
only to learn that a number of street kids have gone
missing after CPS collected them, and that all of them
were picked up by a particular agent. Don’t make the
discovery of vital information hinge on a die roll. If
the PCs take rational investigative steps, they should
be given something to show for it, even if it’s just the
confidence that their current route is a dead end. You
should be trying to give out this information when the
PCs give you an excuse to do so, rather than hoarding
it against all but precisely correct lines of investigation.
You also shouldn’t feel bad about giving PCs a
break if they start to flail, either by introducing a helpful NPC to put them back on the trail or remind them
of some earlier point they didn’t fully investigate. By
the same token, you shouldn’t hesitate to let them deal
with the consequences of tardiness. If they spend too
long in distractions before finding their urchin friend,
they might discover nothing more than spare parts.
One particular point that often comes up is the
question of searching an area. Some GMs just let the
PCs all make Notice checks to see if they notice something hidden. This has the advantage of being quick
and simple, but it also can put vital information at the
mercy of good dice. Other GMs require the players to
specifically say what parts of an area they’re searching,
what they’re looking under or inside, and otherwise
describe the specifics of their search. This can penalize
players who don’t correctly envision the area the GM
is describing. One compromise is to simply give players
vital clues when they say that they are searching, and
then use one or both of the other methods to let them
search for supplementary facts and helpful details.

Salvage

The far future is full of expensive decor. Truly enterprising PCs sometimes are of a mind to “salvage” a place
down to its foundations, ripping out everything that
can be resold and trucking it all off to be converted into
credits. To some extent, this is simply common sense;
no red-blooded freebooter would simply leave unclaimed valuables lying around when he knows they’ll
fetch a good price at the starport. Still, it can be tedious
to handle the logistics of salvage and unbalancing to the
game to allow PCs to cash in on every alien fork and
wall panel they can drag back to civilization.
The easiest way to deal with this is to simply make
clear that most non-portable valuables the PCs might
salvage are just too difficult to move on the secondary
market. Questions of legal ownership, finding a suitably indiscriminate buyer, and avoiding tax scrutiny all
combine to make such efforts more trouble than they’re
worth. It can be interesting to make an adventure out of
moving some particularly exceptional piece of salvage,
but as a general rule, it’s just not worth it to strip the
copper wiring out of a crime boss’ hideout.
There is also the issue of PCs methodically stripping the armor, weapons, and pocket change from their
dead foes. In most cases this is self-limiting, as most
PCs can’t easily pack around a half-dozen combat rifles
while engaged in the kind of pursuits that leave them
fighting their former owners. In the unlikely case that
the PCs come back with a cargo sled, most of the armor is probably worthless due to the perforations that
killed its wearer and the weaponry is unlikely to be so
valuable as to unbalance the game. Even in that case,
moving the weapons on the black market is usually not
a trivial enterprise. You shouldn’t discourage PCs from
upgrading their own equipment from the plunder of
the fallen or taking exceptionally valuable pieces for later fencing, but you shouldn’t feel obligated to let them
decamp with the battlefield on their backs.
The actual mechanics of selling plunder can be as
complicated as you wish to make them. It may be that
what the PCs retrieve can be sold openly on the world,
usually for around half its purchase value if a quick sale
is desired. Something closer to full price can only be obtained with the sort of patience, contacts, and attention
that adventurers rarely have avaialble.
A fence might be needed for those goods which
were acquired in illicit fashion, or items that are outlawed for common trade. Fences rarely pay more than
ten or twenty percent of an item’s purchase price. Many
such difficulties can be removed by taking the loot offworld and laundering it somewhere beyond the reach
of the planet’s laws.

COMPLICATIONS •235

INTERSTELLAR TRADE
As an extension of this, some groups will want to make
a killing in interstellar trade, carrying the goods of one
world to another to make a fast credit. This is a venerable science-fiction trope, and there’s no reason you
shouldn’t allow it, but there are a few considerations
to keep in mind when dealing with space commerce.
Perhaps most importantly, there is no such thing
as interstellar bulk shipping in Stars Without Number.
Even the largest spike drive ships have cargo capacities
measured in a few tens of thousands of tons, while a
modern oil tanker has a capacity of around 500,000
tons. Trying to run a meaningful trade in bulk commodities has been a lost cause ever since the jump gates
failed and massive system-ship freighters could no longer make the jump between worlds. Such commerce
can exist inside a system, with huge slowboats moving
from planet to planet, but modern trade relies on carrying small loads of high-value goods or expert services.
Most small merchant ships such as the ones a PC
group is likely to own rely on in-system supply runs as
their bread and butter. They cart loads of food, water,
replacement personnel, spare parts, and other life support supplies out to remote asteroid mines, research
stations, and extraction plants. The pay is rarely much,
but such supply run missions are excellent hooks for
dropping a group into the middle of some disaster.
Trade beyond supply runs usually revolves around
moving local specialty tech or products. Local art, exotic pharmaceuticals, high-quality technical specialties, or
passengers with special skills who want to reach a particular world all make up this class of trade. For most
purposes, it’s not necessary to really elaborate on the
specifics of this, though it can add flavor to make up a
product or two unique to a given world.
There are also exceptionally risky trading expeditions to lostworlders, bringing the fruits of modern
postech to their benighted nations. While the weaponry, pharmaceuticals, and technical artifacts are usually
greedily desired on these worlds, the natives often have
very little of value to pay for them. Explorer-merchants
often have to investigate a lostworlder culture carefully
before they can identify any particular product or resource that can be usefully shipped interstellar distances to justify the trip. Some particularly unscrupulous
merchants do not balk at taking payment in local slaves
for export to decadent or dangerous worlds.
There are also “missionary” supply runs to these
primitive worlds. The Preceptors of the Great Archive
occasionally run missions on a planet to disseminate
valuable technical and artistic knowledge among the
locals, and there are always a selection of determined
missionaries bent on bringing the word of their faith to
the heathens. While these missions normally can supply their own food, offworld medicine and spares are
vital for keeping their more advanced tech operating.

More sinister than the Preceptors and the pious
are the “Kurtzes”. The prospect of ruling like a god on
some forgotten world lures a certain type of men and
women, a type that might normally be forced to limit
their dark ambitions on a more technically advanced
world, where energy weapons and powered armor
do not give a person so vast an advantage over their
peers. These Kurtzes seek out lost worlds with other
like-minded men and women, usually framing their
ambitions as a matter of “bringing advancement to the
primitives”. Most Kurtz expeditions collapse in blood
and horror within a few years, but some manage to
hold on for far longer.

Quick Trade Rules

For those who prefer not to use the full-fledged rules
for interstellar trade provided in the Suns of Gold supplement, here are a few quick guidelines for responding
to player interest in interstellar trade. They assume the
PCs have a ship, but are just scrounging for marginal
shipments and fast opportunities rather than taking
advantage of a formal trade network and steady, reliable work contracts.
First, let the PCs find a deal for some good that the
planet might reasonably produce. Cheap bulk goods
would run for 2d6 x 10 credits per ton, ordinary finished goods go for 2d6 x 100 credits per ton, and hightech, expensive products are 2d6 x 1,000 credits per ton.
They can find a new deal with a week’s wait.
PCs can try to improve the purchase price with
a Cha/Trade skill check opposed by the seller’s Wis/
Trade skill roll. On a success, the price decreases by 10%
times the level of Trade skill the bargainer has. On a
failure, the price remains firm.
Before the goods are loaded, roll 1d6. If the PCs
tried to get a better price, subtract 1 from the roll. If
the result is 1 or less, something has gone wrong and
the goods are lost, stolen, confiscated, or fake. The PCs
are going to have to either eat the loss or take whatever
adventurous steps are necessary to get their money or
goods back. These steps may involve gunfire.
When the PCs try to sell the goods, assuming the
planet might reasonably want them, roll 2d6+1 and
multiply it by 10 for bulk goods, 100 for finished manufactures, or 1,000 for expensive goods. This is the base
price the buyer offers to the PCs. They can bargain for
better with the same opposed check as before, gaining
a 10% price increase per Trade skill level on a success.
On a failure, the PCs have to accept the offered price.
After the sale is finalized, the 1d6 needs to be rolled
again, also with a -1 penalty if a better price was sought.
On a result of 1 or less, the sale end of things goes awry,
and the PCs are out both money and goods. To salvage
them, they’ll need to conduct some sort of adventure
revolving around reclaiming their rightful due.

236• CONVERTING FIRST EDITION

CONVERTING FIRST EDITION STARS WITHOUT NUMBER
Most of this edition’s content can be used interchangeably with first edition Stars Without Number. Characters may be created somewhat differently, starships
might handle combat in a new way, and psionics might
have changed, but the end result largely uses the same
statistics and same score ranges. An original-edition
Stars Without Number character can adventure in a revised-edition campaign without requiring much in the
way of special rules.
Some GMs will want guidelines on converting an
existing original-edition game to the current edition.
This is a simple process, as the scales are the same.

Converting Characters

Characters have the same attributes, character level,
and all other scores unless specified otherwise. Skills
are converted directly into the closest equivalent; Combat/Projectile becomes Shoot, and so forth. In the case
of multiple skills now compressed into a single skill,
like a PC with both Combat/Projectile and Combat/
Energy, the highest skill is converted and the lower
skills can be exchanged for any other skills of the same
level of the player’s choice.
PCs retain their class. Hit points are re-rolled for
the character based on their revised-edition hit die.
Thus, a 5th level Psychic can reroll 5d6 for their hit
points. PCs may keep their existing hit point totals if
the new roll is lower.
PCs may pick a number of foci appropriate to
their class and level. If converting a 2nd level Warrior, for example, the PC could pick their initial focus,
their bonus Warrior focus, and the focus they get at
second level. If they pick foci that grant bonus skills,
apply the bonus as 3 additional skill points to the skill
as described on page 57.
PC experience points are pro-rated based on the
campaign. If the character was halfway to 7th level in
the existing campaign, place their experience points
halfway to 7th level under the revised rules.
Attack bonuses and Armor Class are calculated using the new rules, as are saving throw scores.

Converting Psionics

The rules above are sufficient for converting most PCs,
but the powers of Psychic PCs are a bit trickier.
To get the PC’s psychic skill ratings, take their primary discipline, halve it, and round it up. Take their
other disciplines, halve them, and round down. Thus,
a PC with a primary Telepathy discpline of 9 and secondary disciplines of Metapsionics 7 and Biopsionics
2 would be converted to Telepathy-5, Metapsionics-3
and Biopsionics-1. For disciplines above level-0, they
can pick a free technique from each skill level they
know, plus one additional technique for each discipline
from any level they know. Calculate Effort normally.

Converting Creatures

Flip Armor Classes to ascending values by subtracting
the creature’s AC from 20. No other changes are needed; existing attack bonuses, hit dice, saving throws, and
so forth can be used as written.

Converting Ships

Give NPC ships an appropriate number of Command
Points to use each round in ship combat. Civilian ships
and fighters should have 4 CP, military ships and experienced pirates should have 5 CP, and higher scores
should be reserved for elite or spacer-native crews.
Adjust the ship’s maintenance cost based on the
new six-month maintenance schedule.
Ship statistics such as hit points, speed, Power,
Mass, and other attributes are generally the same in
both editions. If the PCs build a new ship you can check
it against the numbers, but existing ships can be left
unchanged during use.

Converting Equipment

Most equipment and weaponry can be used unchanged,
as they’re the same in both editions. You may need to
use the revised edition version of a particular suit of
armor or treat a monoblade as a medium advanced
weapon rather than a unique type of armament, but
no real conversion is needed.
For melee weapons, give it the appropriate Shock
rating for its size. Small weapons have Shock scores of
1/AC 15, medium weapons have scores of 2/13 AC, and
large weapons have scores of 2/15 AC.
For gear that forces a saving throw on a target,
simply have the victim make whichever saving throw
seems most appropriate to the item’s effect. In case of
Luck saves, substitute Mental saves or a pure blind
chance of 50% success.

Using Existing Sourcebooks

Existing Stars Without Number sourcebooks such as
Suns of Gold, Skyward Steel, Starvation Cheap, and
Darkness Visible can be used with few or no changes.
Most of the resources in these books were designed to
be used in a system-agnostic fashion, and the agency
construction rules in Darkness Visible or the interstellar
trade rules in Suns of Gold can be employed without
altering anything.
In a few cases, these sourcebooks may call for
checks from skills that have been changed in the revised
edition. Simply use the new version’s skill in such cases;
if Suns of Gold tells you to add a PC’s Business score to
some total, just add their Trade score instead.

HOUSE RULES •237

HOUSE RULES AND THE GAME
Stars Without Number derives from an old-school gaming tradition where house rules were almost universal.
The basic chassis of the game is simple enough and
rugged enough to handle all kinds of tweaks and adjustments without collapsing, and it is your sacred and
inalienable right to bend the game in any direction you
wish if it improves your fun.
You are encouraged to try the rules as-written at
first, though, so you can be sure that you really do want
to change something. If you do decide to shuffle things
around, here are some possible house rules you could
adopt, and some suggestions about their effects.
No Shock Damage: Weapons do not do Shock damage.
This can simplify melee combat at the cost of discouraging PCs from choosing to use melee weapons and increasing the “whiff” factor with them.
If you drop Shock damage, you might also choose
to drop the Snap Attack combat maneuver, as it’s
no longer necessary to give gunslingers a way to
blaze down charging melee attackers before they
get into range.
Use Original Skill Lists: Like the skill list from the original edition of SWN better? Use it instead. When
creating characters, allow skill picks or rolls to
be converted to a corresponding original-edition
skill. If the PC rolls “Shoot”, for example, let them
pick Combat/Gunnery, Combat/Projectile, or
Combat/Energy instead. When the existing rules
call for a particular new skill, let the PC use any old
skill that plausibly matches its function.
Don’t Use Command Points: Don’t want to track Command Points in ship combat? Eliminate all actions
that grant Command Points and just let each PC
pick one action from their department list each
turn. The captain’s Support Department action
now gives that department a bonus action, and
the gunner now has a Fire At A System action that
lets them fire one weapon at a targeted system at
a -4 penalty to hit. NPC ships can either fire all
weapons in a round or fire only one weapon and
take one action relevant to their immediate needs.
No Ranged Weapon Binding: One of the significant
combat differences between the revised edition
of the game and the original is the rule limiting
the use of ranged weapons when a hostile melee
combatant is adjacent. Some GMs will want to
drop this rule for simplicity’s sake, and that can
work, but it may leave melee specialists feeling a
little superfluous.
Use a Grid in Combat: While the game isn’t written
around the use of miniatures and a combat grid,
GMs who want to go to the extra effort of making up such resources can do so. Using two-meter
squares or hexes is likely to give the best results.

Eliminate Psionics: Some GMs who want a more “hard
sci-fi” game might choose to ditch psionics from
the setting. In their absence, the Scream can simply have been an alien energy pulse that shattered
the Jump Gates and left the worlds of humankind
isolated for centuries. If you eliminate psychic PCs,
however, you’ll want to take care that the group
has access to other healing resources, such as stims
and trained PC medics.
Drop FTL Starflight: GMs who want to run a strictly one-solar-system game might eliminate FTL
spaceflight as an option. The Engines of Babylon
supplement for the original game discusses how to
change the starship rules for a TL3 campaign that
has edged into intra-system space flight.
Boost Starting Levels: The default campaign assumes
that PCs will start at first level, as experienced
but extremely mortal heroes. Groups that want
to make room for a little more durability without
using the heroic PC rules in the game’s deluxe version might choose to start at third level instead of
first, or give a flat 10 HP bonus to all PCs.
Add Universal Psionics: A GM might choose to run a
campaign where every PC has some degree of
psionic power. In such games, every PC should
get the bonus of being a Partial Psychic as given
under the Adventurer class. Adventurers who
choose the Partial Psychic option should be treated as full Psychics, and the full Psychic class itself is
dropped. If using the space magic rules in the deluxe game version, the same method can be used
to add universal magic abilities to PCs, either as
partial Magisters, Adepts, or Arcanists.
Use Plot Points: Some groups prefer to have a certain
amount of narrative control given to the PCs, either to save them from otherwise-certain doom or
allow them to make certain statements about the
situation that are automatically true. Under such
circumstances, you might give each PC two “plot
points” that can be spent to save them when they
would otherwise certainly perish, or else make an
adjustment to the current adventuring situation
that the GM judges amenable. Each time the PC
advances a level, these plot points reset. Any unspent ones are lost.
Make Combat a Bloodbath: A few groups like to emphasize the abject horror and murderous danger of
combat in their campaigns. For these groups, you
can add the simple rule that every attack roll made
on an even-numbered round of combat will automatically hit unless there’s a penalty on the roll,
whether due to cover or circumstances. In that
case, the attack is rolled normally. PCs who get
involved in combat thus know they have a very
limited amount of time to resolve the situation.

238• NAME GENERATORS

NAME GENERATORS
What’s in a name? For most campaigns, a very great
deal. Names and naming conventions are an important
and useful tool for giving your worlds a sense of coherence and verisimilitude. It’s all too easy to fall into
the easy convention of nonsense-syllable names when
a GM can get much more world-building mileage out
of a more thoughtful use of language.
The names of people and places on a world should
be in conformity with the local language. Every world
is going to have its oddball names, but if the great majority of them share the same basic roots, it helps give
the world a sense of cohesion and place. Even when the
players have no knowledge whatsoever of the language
or culture being used as a touchstone, using the same
linguistic roots ensures that the same basic palette of
sounds and word fragments will be used.
Note that language and culture are separable. Just
because you’ve got a world flavored with Arabian-style
architecture and kinship groupings, there’s no reason
you can’t use French or Spanish for the language. A
thousand-odd years in the far future, cultural transmutations unimaginable to us at present have taken
place throughout human space. There no doubt exist centuries-old interstellar cultures that bear only a
vague resemblance to their original forms. Take advantage of this to make your own life easier.

Making Names Memorable

One difficulty that occasionally comes up at the table is
a difficulty in remembering names that don’t have any
grounding in languages spoken by the players. Without any mnemonic hook or familiarity, one string of
polysyllables tends to blur into another.
One way to get around this problem is to attach
strong visual or character cues to individual NPCs.
Players might not remember a particular spaceport
hand’s name, but they’ll remember the guy who’s constantly smoking a reeking cheroot, or the woman with
fiber-optic laced hair. As the GM, you can help prevent
forgetfulness by using the NPC’s name regularly as well.

Creating Alien Names

One quick trick for creating wholly alien names is to
hunt up a very obscure language online and just use
its words to name exotic entities and places. The players are unlikely to recognize Galatian or Gothic, so
you spare yourself from carrying the implicit cultural
baggage of the tongue, but the language still retains a
characteristic set of sounds that will help maintain a
coherent aural landscape. Further “palette swaps” of
vowels, particular consonant clusters or the like can
make an “alien language” out of almost any speech.

ONE-ROLL NPCS
There will be times when a GM needs an NPC on short
notice. The preceding name generators can be used in
conjunction with these tables to quickly produce a minor fill-in character for your adventure. Simply roll one
of each type of die: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20. Match
them to the tables, smooth over any rough joins, and
you have your instant NPC.

have whatever weaponry, armor, or other personal
possessions might be appropriate for someone in their
social circumstance.

ONE-ROLL PATRONS •245

ONE-ROLL PATRONS
PCs often need patrons to aim them at adventures or
offer suitable recompense for semi-legal favors. In conjunction with the adjacent one-roll NPC tables, you can
use the tools below to quickly generate a patron and
what it is they want from the party.
One particularly convenient technique is to have
a few short filler adventures drawn up as described on
page 177, and then when the players suddenly need
a job or need a favor that only a cooperative patron
could provide, use the patron to hook them up with
the filler adventure. If you lack a convenient premade
adventure, it’s usually most practical to have the patron
request some simple, direct, one-scene job that you feel
comfortable in running on the fly. You can consult page
178 to find appropriate pay rates for different patrons.

246• ONE-ROLL URBAN ENCOUNTERS

ONE-ROLL URBAN ENCOUNTERS
There are inevitably times when a GM needs something to distract the PCs quickly. A quick encounter,
whether in the urban jungles or the alien wastes, can
buy a GM the time they need to puzzle out some larger
problem. The tables here can be used to create a simple
urban event to occupy the PCs for a little while.
The exact details of the event will have to be supplied by the GM in such a way as to fit the planet’s
culture and situation, but the goal of the tables is to
provide a fast conflict that the PCs can interact with
meaningfully. If the PCs resist the hook, it’s a relatively
simple matter to make the avoidance of it enough of a
challenge that it buys you the time you needed in the
first place. Don’t force the PCs to engage with it, but
let them work a little to get free.

ONE-ROLL WILDERNESS ENCOUNTERS •247

ONE-ROLL WILDERNESS ENCOUNTERS
Building appropriate wilderness encounters will vary
greatly with the planet in question, but the tables below
assume that the wilderness is on an inhabited world
with some vague analogs to Terran terrain and vegetation. If the world is devoid of human inhabitants,
replace the features with alien relics or the remnants
of scouts or lost colonies.
The tables below provide a suggested time of day
and initial distance for the encounter, but these baselines will vary depending on the choices and capabilities
of the PCs. Some encounters are unlikely to occur at
night, unless the parties involved are traveling or otherwise active despite the dark. Suggestions are given
for likely-hostile and likely-friendly creatures, but a
reaction roll will influence attitudes greatly.
